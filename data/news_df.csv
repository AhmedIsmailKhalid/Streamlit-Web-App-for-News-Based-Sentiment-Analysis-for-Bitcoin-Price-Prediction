2021-06-22T14:06:07.000Z," * Graphic: World FX rates https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E (Adds quotes, updates prices; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Tuesday before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress, with investors anxious to see whether Powell pushes back against the view that the Fed is likely to raise rates sooner than previously expected as inflation rises. The dollar has surged since the U.S. central bank on Wednesday said that policymakers are forecasting two rate hikes in 2023. That led investors to re-evaluate bets that the U.S. central bank will let inflation run at higher levels for a longer time before hiking rates. “I think today Powell is going to be able to reset his message,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. “Investors want to get a better view to see whether or not Powell does pull back a little bit of that extra hawkishness that we got last week.” The dollar index gained 0.11% to 91.998, but is holding below a two-month high of 92.408 reached on Friday. The euro fell 0.09% to $1.1906 and the dollar gained 0.30% to 110.69 Japanese yen. Powell has said that he wants to see further progress in employment before tightening policy. He said in prepared remarks released on Monday that the economy continues to show ""sustained improvement"" from the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing job market gains, but inflation has ""increased notably in recent months."" Powell did not go into detail on the possibility the U.S. central bank may have to speed up its plans to pull back on some support for the economy because of the faster rise in prices. Some analysts have also speculated that the rate hike forecasts may reflect the views of more hawkish non-voting Fed members and not the core group of dovish Fed policymakers that dominate policy. The debate over when and how the Federal Reserve could begin to reduce some of its massive stimulus for the economy was on full display on Monday, as two U.S. central bank officials explained their support for an earlier withdrawal and a third said any change was still quite a ways away. Bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since January on Tuesday, adding to losses sparked a day earlier when China's central bank deepened a crackdown on cryptocurrencies. It was last at $29,497, down 6.76% on the day. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 9:32AM (1332 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Dollar index 91.9980 91.9110 +0.11% 2.242% +92.1390 +91.8900 Euro/Dollar $1.1906 $1.1918 -0.09% -2.55% +$1.1920 +$1.1881 Dollar/Yen 110.6850 110.3500 +0.30% +7.16% +110.7150 +110.3600 Euro/Yen 131.78 131.46 +0.24% +3.83% +131.8100 +131.2300 Dollar/Swiss 0.9197 0.9178 +0.19% +3.94% +0.9212 +0.9178 Sterling/Dollar $1.3892 $1.3934 -0.29% +1.69% +$1.3937 +$1.3861 Dollar/Canadian 1.2386 1.2362 +0.19% -2.73% +1.2403 +1.2360 Aussie/Dollar $0.7514 $0.7542 -0.37% -2.32% +$0.7545 +$0.7495 Euro/Swiss 1.0949 1.0939 +0.09% +1.31% +1.0952 +1.0938 Euro/Sterling 0.8568 0.8551 +0.20% -4.13% +0.8582 +0.8552 NZ $0.6986 $0.6992 -0.04% -2.67% +$0.6994 +$0.6964 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway 8.5965 8.5800 +0.24% +0.16% +8.6125 +8.5725 Euro/Norway 10.2340 10.2112 +0.22% -2.23% +10.2487 +10.2091 Dollar/Sweden 8.5393 8.5287 +0.10% +4.18% +8.5662 +8.5268 Euro/Sweden 10.1679 10.1575 +0.10% +0.91% +10.1863 +10.1538 (Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London, Editing by Nick Zieminski) Novavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T14:14:02.000Z," Tuesday, June 22, 2021Market futures have flatlined ahead of Tuesday’s opening bell, following a big rally Monday where investors found an appetite to buy attractive valuations in equities depleted from last week’s sell-off. We’ve bounced around quite a bit this morning, but are generally seeing modest losses ahead of the opening bell. The Dow had been up nearly 50 points in today’s pre-market, but those have evaporated. All this on zero economic news this morning other than Bitcoin.Bitcoin has dipped beneath the 30K threshold in today’s pre-market, a drop of more than 8%. We’re already well down from peak Bitcoin value at 63,346 roughly 10 weeks ago; now analysts are looking for support levels. Much of this latest leg-down comes from China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining, where much of the crypto activity has occurred. Should there be interest elsewhere in the world to take on the drop in crypto mining China has given up, it’s not easy to tell where this might be right now.Fed Chair Jay Powell heads to Capitol Hill this afternoon, to appear before a House select sub-committee to answer questions raised from last week’s Fed announcement on a new dot-plot for raising interest rates in the future. The Fed is now “talking about” perhaps tapering the bond buyback program backstopping the U.S. economy, as inflationary pressure in the current market continue to be considered transitory.It’s unlikely a revelation is going to come from a Q&A between Powell and lawmakers today, at least relative to last week’s report which saw investors sell the news on the strengthening economy eventually bringing an end to highly accommodative fiscal policy. Even if, as was inferred in last week’s press conference with Powell following the Fed announcement that Powell himself was interested in seeing rates increase sooner (2022) than later (2023), that horse is already free from the stable.After the market opens this morning, Existing Home Sales for May come out. Expectations are for 5.68 million on the month, down from the 5.85 million, which was already the lowest level since June 2020. Existing Home Sales put up a multi-year peak last fall and winter, north of 6.5 million per month, but have hit the same wall the housing market has hit this spring — much higher input costs on a glut of supplies have thrown a wet blanket on the hot industry.This Existing Home Sales survey, which goes back to 1968, put in all-time highs back in the mid-Aughts, ahead of the mortgage-based financial collapse in late 2008. The amount of used homes sold back then, roughly 7.25 million in one month, in no way led to the eventual collapse — which had to do with falsely accredited sub-prime loans listed at AAA ratings and sold as derivatives — but it shows that we’ve still got a ways to go before the housing market shows signs of strain.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2021-06-22T15:13:31.000Z," Shares of MicroStrategy are falling Tuesday, dragged down by the collapse in the price of bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency the firm’s CEO has bet the business-intelligence software company’s future on – a wager that could soon become a money-losing one if bitcoin drops much further.MicroStrategy exploded onto the crypto scene last summer after CEO Michael Saylor used the company’s treasury reserves to buy bitcoin. And then he bought some more. And so on. And so on. At last count, the firm held some 105,085 bitcoins, making the firm by far the cryptocurrency’s largest known corporate holder.Up until a little more than two months ago, with the bitcoin bull market in full swing, that bet was paying off handsomely. Now, not so much. After reaching an all-time high of more than $64,000 in mid-April, the price of bitcoin has more than halved for several reasons, including concerns about the environmental impact of mining for bitcoin, a crackdown on crypto by China and fears of a hostile regulatory climate in the U.S.With the price of bitcoin currently at around $29,000, it’s about $3,000 per coin above the average price of $26,080 that Saylor shelled out for his bitcoin. Should bitcoin fall below that, MicroStrategy’s bitcoin gamble would become a money-losing one.As it is, if bitcoin doesn’t rebound in a big way by the end of June, MicroStrategy would be forced to write down even the bitcoin it bought just a few days ago.On Monday, the company said it had bought 13,005 bitcoin for $489 million at an average price of $37,617, including transaction costs. If the current Q2 were to close right now with bitcoin trading at about $29,000, MicroStrategy would need to write that purchase down by about $96 million.It’s not just shareholders who likely aren’t happy with Saylor right now. In addition to using cash flow to buy bitcoin, MicroStrategy has sold debt – some of it convertible – to fund its crypto-buying ways. It also recently said it was going to sell shares to buy more bitcoin, though that currency doesn’t buy what it did even a week ago. This past Friday, shares of MicroStrategy closed at $647.39 a share. In recent trading, they were at $517.93, down 11.26% on the day. In February they hit a 52-week high of $1,315.Still, long-time holders know that back in August 2020, when Saylor bought his first bitcoin, the company’s shares were less than $200 apiece.Polkadot on Coinbase Went Up More Than 70% in the Midst of Crypto Market Sell-OffMarket Wrap: Bitcoin Back Above $30K in Volatile Trading SessionMicroStrategy’s Most Recent Bond Drops Below Par as Bitcoin Sells OffChina’s Anti-Crypto Crackdown Is Different This TimeRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T15:15:45.000Z," After a rocket ride that saw it more than double in price earlier this year, Bitcoin is back to where it started.The cryptocurrency went negative for the year early Tuesday as prices continue to plunge amid an ongoing crypto crash. Right around 10:09 a.m. ET, the price of Bitcoin fell to $28,814.75, about $300 below where it started the year. Prices have recovered slightly since reaching that low, but Bitcoin is hovering right at the $30,000 benchmark and, as of 10:54 a.m. ET, is down more than 8% for the day, according to Coindesk.Tuesday’s dive is a continuation of Monday’s sell-off, as traders worry that China’s crackdown on the cryptocurrency could greatly reduce demand. (The People’s Bank of China ordered major financial institutions in that country to stop facilitating crypto transactions.)It’s a hard fall for Bitcoin, which topped off at more than $64,000 in mid-April. Last month, it fell 35%, though, and the sell-off hasn’t eased since. Some proponents, like CNBC’s Jim Cramer, have sold off the majority of their portfolios.“This is not going up because of structural reasons,” Cramer said Monday.Bitcoin is not the only crypto that’s in free-fall. Ethereum was down nearly 12% early Tuesday, but is still well above where it started the year. And one-time favorite Dogecoin has been sent to the pound, with prices plummeting nearly 23% to just 17 cents. While that’s still a 3,505% return for people who invested at the start of the year, it’s miles away from the $1 target that seemed very attainable just one month ago.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T15:36:21.000Z," Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell more than 11% Tuesday morning after China ramped up its crackdown on cryptocurrency mining.The cryptocurrency, which in April had risen higher than $60,000, plunged to a value of under $30,000 and saw all 2021 gains disappear. It rose back up a little past $30,000 later in the morning but remained down several points from the day before.The dramatic fall comes as China has taken steps to further restrict Bitcoin mining and trading within its territory.China released a statement Monday relaying how it had told several major lenders and banks to ""comprehensively investigate and identify"" cryptocurrency exchanges and dealers in order to aid efforts to restrict trading. In the past couple of months, China has increased crackdowns on mining, creating a significantly rougher environment for the world's leading miner of bitcoin.“A decentralized computing source, as well as distributed governance, is almost antithetical — it is antithetical — to what the Chinese Communist Party believes,” Ava Labs President John Wu told Yahoo Finance Live.China recently restricted cryptocurrency mining in the Sichuan region, one of the country's largest crypto mining provinces. This crackdown is being carried out through the targeting of electric companies for inspection to ensure mining activity is terminated. Alipay, a Chinese online payment platform, also recently announced it would cut ties with people engaged in virtual currency transactions. Yet Nik Bhatia, an adjunct professor at University of Southern California, noted that China's crackdown may not necessarily indicate aversion to cryptocurrency, or even bitcoin in particular.""The Chinese Communist Party has made it known for the last several years, couple decades, that rising up to be the geopolitical superpower in the world, replacing the United States or at least being on par with the United States is their stated goal,"" Bhatia said. ""And so when you look at the wave of adoption of bitcoin and its position as a macroasset, I do believe that China wants to be a part of that ... What I've seen from articles that have come out in Chinese newspapers, for example, is that they identify bitcoin as a potential digital gold and a solid investment opportunity looking forward into the future. We have on one side, China might be embracing Bitcoin as an investment and then the other side, they want to crack down on mining, they want to make sure that illegal trading is taken out of the marketplace and that the government has control over it. So, it's really a tale of two worlds.""He projected a multi-trillion-dollar market cap over the next few years (the cryptocurrency reached a trillion-dollar market cap earlier this year), and that price will rise accordingly. ""For example, a two trillion dollar market cap of bitcoin will be about a hundred thousand dollars, so I think that's the direction that we're heading in this particular asset.""More from Ihsaan:Electric aircraft company Vertical Aerospace plans to go publicOnly 20% of Americans familiar with NFTs, 4 million have used: SurveyBitcoin to tumble further: oddsmakers bet on drop to $10KRead the latest cryptocurrency and bitcoin news from Yahoo FinanceRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and redditRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T16:05:15.000Z," A pair of nominees for the U.S. Treasury Department pledged to, if confirmed, ensure new anti-money laundering (AML) regulations involving cryptocurrencies would be implemented.President Joe Biden (D) nominated Brian Nelson to be Under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes and Elizabeth Rosenberg to be assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing earlier this year. The Senate Banking Committee held a confirmation hearing on Tuesday to debate their nominations, addressing different issues around financial crimes and whether or not crypto plays a role.In response to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) asking the nominees how they would limit the damage from crypto-related crimes, Nelson noted the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, a bill passed into law last year, already tasks the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with applying new crypto-related regulations.Related: Upside Elusive for Bitcoin as Yellen Says Fed Rate Hike a &#8216;Plus&#8217;“Obviously this is an issue that was [and] has been a great concern for some time now, and it’s reflected in the new Anti-Money Laundering Act that this committee really championed,” he said. If confirmed he said he “would prioritize implementing pieces of that legislation including new regulations around cryptocurrency.”The Treasury Department’s Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes office would have to work with its international partners to address crypto crimes, he added.Likewise, Rosenberg noted that international cooperation is needed to tackle cryptocurrency-related crimes. She said she would “seek to ensure” that any cryptocurrency regulations are both appropriate and consistent across different jurisdictions.Part of TFFC’s mission is to coordinate with international offices to ensure different nations all have similar regulatory regimes, she said.Related: US Treasury Calls for Businesses to Report Crypto Transfers of More Than $10K to the IRS“Without that kind of collaboration and … regulatory framework, it’s all too easy for criminals to avoid the U.S. jurisdiction and conduct their illegitimate activity from another jurisdiction,” she said.The nominees’ comments reflect a growing level of scrutiny around the role cryptocurrencies play in different sorts of crimes. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen repeatedly brought up concerns around crypto use in terrorist financing during her own confirmation process, and recent ransomware attacks have drawn further attention to cryptocurrencies.“It reflects a balancing of regulating to prevent virtual currency and other types of new technology from undermining our AML system while also being respectful of the fact that we need to support responsible innovation and preserve that here in the U.S. and not see that leave the country,” Nelson said.Fed Director Michael Hsu to Succeed Brian Brooks at OCCBitcoin Bounces Back to $55K as Yellen Backtracks on Rate Hike CommentsRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

       was on the verge of erasing its year-to-date gains on Tuesday, after briefly slipping below a psychologically important level at $30,000. At last check, bitcoin was changing hands at $31,005,61, after hitting a 24-hour low of $28,814.75, which marked its lowest level since around January this year. Bitcoin is nursing a year-to-date gain of under 4% after boasting a gain earlier in the year of over 100%.Here’s what some crypto and investing professionals are advising against that backdrop. Iqbal Gandham vice president of transactions at Ledger said that a pullback in crypto was inevitable, given the run-up. “ Any asset class which sees a meteoric rise in the same way as we have seen in crypto is expected to correct,” he wrote, in emailed remarks. He said that China’s intensified crackdown on crypto, including bans on mining and trading, has only amplified the downside. That said, he believes that “the underlying fundamentals of the crypto-asset world have not changed.” Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments said that the ban on crypto activities in the People’s Republic has forced mining operations to shift to other areas outside of China, which was one of the most active areas of bitcoin mining, and that may take a while to resolve itself. “Recent regulations in China have forced many Bitcoin miners to pack up and look for alternate locations,” he wrote. He says that the decline in crypto could be lengthy and pronounced. “The drop from a high of almost $65,000 is now down well over 50%, signaling that Bitcoin traders could find themselves in choppy waters for weeks to come,” Rooney wrote.Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics provider Trade The Chain, said that at least part of the decline in prices for bitcoin is due to mining operations being forced to sell their stock of bitcoin to offset the cost of closures. “The market is currently being inundated with supply as Chinese miners have been selling their crypto to cover the cost of shuttering operations,” he explained. “This is having a negative impact on all prices, with altcoins being the most impacted,” the analyst added. Mancini said that savvy investors “may want to watch Bitcoin for increased order book interest in the $20,000 range,” suggesting that it could fall to that level, signaling a possible reversal is at hand, however. To be sure, there is no one-size-fits-all model for investing in crypto and buying is dependent on investors’ tolerance to losses and their long-term perspective, strategists note. Nicholas Cawley at DailyFX wrote that these downturns aren’t uncommon in crypto but said that recent investors may be more inclined to hold on for an uptrend, given the recent crypto price collapse. “We have seen these moves before, and will likely see them again. If you believe in cryptos, and are a holder, your exit strategy has just been pushed further into the distance,” he wrote. Crypto watchers have said that the sector tends to operate in four-year cycles, which begins with euphoria, followed by a crash and ending with a persistent period of languishing prices.That has been the case thus far in 2013, 2017 and this year’s most recent moves.

2021-06-22T16:32:13.000Z," Stocks extended gains on Tuesday, with equities steadying following concerns over the path forward for monetary policy. The S&P 500 advanced to end within striking distance of a record high. The Dow also added to gains, a day after the 30-stock index jumped by the most since March. The Nasdaq reached a record intraday and closing high.Cryptocurrency prices were broadly lower as concerns over tighter regulatory actions from China continued to weigh, and tokens from Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to the meme-based Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) added to recent losses. Bitcoin prices fell below $30,000 and erased year-to-date gains at their intraday lows.Tuesday's session saw traders turn back toward tech stocks, with ""reopening"" stocks in the travel industries including airlines and cruise lines slumping after the Federal Reserve's increased inflation outlook raised concerns that higher prices would ultimately weigh on the economic recovery. According to some traders, now that the Fed has signaled it would move to stem fast-rising inflation, some of the longer-term allure of the cyclical trade may be lifted. ""I think the question is going to be here is, we were priced very dovishly going into the Fed. We appear to now be priced quite hawkishly. Clearly, the right outcome is somewhere in the middle,"" Stuart Kaiser, UBS head of equity derivatives research, told Yahoo Finance. ""So will energy benefit from a rebalancing of those expectations? Potentially. I think right now though, what we're seeing is people are readjusting their expectations, a little bit less excited about those, quote, unquote, 'reflation' sectors and maybe focused a little more on tech at the moment."" Others offered a similar view. ""One of the things we've been watching very closely is which way inflationary pressure would tip some of the growth stocks,"" Ann Berry, Wheelhouse chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance on Monday. ""What we've seen today, which is the upward movement again on the Nasdaq, the upward movement again on some of the key technology stocks ... is very much in keeping with what we would have expected – which is, as folks look where to put their capital in a rising inflation environment, this return to growth feels natural.""""We're really looking now as people come out with announcements on what the second half of the year looks like, we're looking at what new business models are likely to persist going into this post-COVID environment,"" she added. With second-quarter earnings season ramping up over the next couple of weeks, investors are also gearing up for a potentially repeat performance of strong corporate profit results, with earnings turbo-charged by vaccinated, savings-laden consumers eager to go out and spend. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" ""I continue to believe that earnings are going to outperform. Expectations are getting better and better managed. But if you look at the blowout first quarter we had, I think there's enough momentum to continue that, which are going to make stocks an interesting investment throughout the year,"" Mitch Roschelle, Macro Trends Advisors LLC Founding Partner, told Yahoo Finance. ""There likely will be a correction somewhere during the year, because there always is, but right now going into earnings season, I see tailwinds and not headwinds.""—Here were the main moves in markets as of 4:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +21.65 (+0.51%) to 4,246.44Dow (^DJI): +68.61 (+0.20%) to 33,945.58Nasdaq (^IXIC): +111.79 (+0.79%) to 14,253.27Crude (CL=F): -$0.58 (-0.79%) to $73.08 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$5.90 (-0.33%) to $1,777.00 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.2 bps to yield 1.4720%—The Nasdaq Composite rose more than 0.5% to reach a record intraday high Tuesday afternoon as technology stocks outperformed.

These remarks are set to reaffirm the stance Powell took just last week in delivering his post-FOMC meeting press conference. In those, the central bank leader urged market participants to take the Fed's projection materials – which suggested two rate hikes by year-end 2023 — as only speculation based on current conditions.""Since we last met, the economy has shown sustained improvement,"" Powell said in the remarks, while adding that, ""As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace has been uneven."" ""The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook,"" according to the remarks. ""The pace of vaccinations has slowed and new strains of the virus remain a risk. Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions.""—Existing home sales fell for a fourth consecutive month last month as tight inventory levels and rising prices weighed on housing market activity.  Sales of previously owned homes were down 0.9% in May over April to reach a seasonally adjusted annualized level of 5.8 million, according to the National Association of Realtors' monthly report.

The drop added to a recent slump over the past several sessions, with concerns over a regulatory crackdown out of China weighing on Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, came within about $500 of erasing year-to-date gains, after entering 2021 just above $29,000. Earlier this week, the People's Bank of China, or China's central bank, said it convened a meeting with some of the country's largest banks to urge the firms to enforce bans on cryptocurrency trading and other services. This added to concerns for crypto holders after reports last week suggested a major Chinese city was planning to shut down all Bitcoin and Ethereum mining operations within a year.—Shares of GameStop (GME) rose more than 8% in early trading after the company announced it raised about $1.13 billion in a previously disclosed equity offering. The company had disclosed on June 9 that it planned to sell 5 million shares of common stock in an at-the-market share sale. Proceeds from the offering will be used ""for general corporate purposes as well as for investing in growth initiatives and maintaining a strong balance sheet,"" according to the video game retailer. —Here's where markets were trading Tuesday morning: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 4,218.75, +5 points (+0.12%)Dow futures (YM=F): 33,782.00, +21 points (+0.06%)Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 14,164.50, +34.5 points (+0.24%)Crude (CL=F): -$0.51 (-0.69%) to $73.15 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$3.30 (+0.19%) to $1,786.20 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -0.1 bps to yield 1.4840%—Here's where markets were trading Monday evening:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 4,218.75, +5 points (+0.12%)Dow futures (YM=F): 33,802.00, +41 points (+0.12%)Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 14,140.5, +10.5 points (+0.07%)—Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2021-06-22T16:57:53.000Z," Bitcoin prices have crashed from the euphoric highs of 2021, and some on the Street think it's weighing on Tesla's stock seeing as it got into the market for the crypto in February. ""It [bitcoin] has been quite a bit of a distraction given the size of the company [Tesla]. So it really shouldn't be taking too much impact, but there is a lot of news with the company — I imagine it is creating some volatility for sure,"" Wells Fargo auto and mobility analyst Colin Langan said on Yahoo Finance Live. It's hard to argue the hypothesis. Tesla shares have plunged 27% since the automaker disclosed on Feb. 8 it had purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin to be held on its balance sheet. Bitcoin prices have sold off by 16% to $32,000 going back to Tesla's announcement. From the record highs of more than $63,000 hit in mid-April (in part fueled by Tesla's bitcoin appetite), bitcoin has shed nearly 50% as regulators in China crack down on mining in the country. Negative tweets on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining from Tesla CEO Elon Musk haven't helped bitcoin prices, either. Musk clarified in mid-May that Tesla hadn't sold any of its bitcoin holdings in the face of such concerns. Despite the assurance from crypto influencer Musk, bitcoin prices have continued to trade with a downward bias given global regulatory concerns. Unless Tesla discloses on its second quarter earnings release in coming weeks it sold off all its bitcoin (thereby breaking the correlation between Tesla's stock and bitcoin), its stock could stay under pressure amid a muted outlook for the crypto's price. J.P.

In addition, the high volatility associated with crypto creates a high risk of loss, the authority said.The regulatory body stressed the cryptocurrency market remains largely unregulated and consumer protections are needed.In September 2020 the European Commission presented a proposal for regulation of the crypto market, but the rules won’t be in place for several years, the FSA noted.“Until such regulations are in place, anyone considering trading in cryptocurrency should think carefully and understand the significant risk that such investments entail. Consumers who want to try this with open eyes should not invest more than they can afford to lose,” said the FSA.Read more: Norway’s Central Bank to Test Technical Solutions for a CBDC Over Next Two YearsWyoming Deposit & Transfer Gets Charter to Provide Crypto Custodial ServicesMicroStrategy Buys $489M More of Bitcoin; Price Drop May Mean Writedown AheadSecuritize Raises $48M in Funding Round Led by Morgan Stanley, Blockchain CapitalSpain’s BBVA Opening Bitcoin Trading Service to Private Banking Clients in SwitzerlandNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T17:45:06.000Z," CipherTrace, a security firm that tracks crypto crimes, has closed a $27.1 million Series B round of funding led by Dan Loeb’s Third Point Ventures, CoinDesk has learned. The fundraising round was also backed by early investors Neotribe, Acrew Capital and Seraph Group.A representative for Third Point Ventures, which received a CipherTrace board seat, confirmed its participation in the funding, in an email to CoinDesk. Loeb’s investment companies have now backed three crypto startups, including Bitwise and eToro.Related: Visa, PayPal Join Crypto VC Blockchain Capital’s New $300M FundCipherTrace plans to double its 100-person operation by June 2022 as it tries to capitalize on the growing market for crypto intelligence. It’s hardly alone in the field. TRM Labs and Chainalysis have raised capital in the last three months, Blocktrace unveiled a new software product on Monday, and Elliptic announced today that it has completed a pilot project with Santander, Spain’s largest bank, to detect suspicious activity. “It’s a good time to be in our space,” CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans told CoinDesk in an interview. He said he has had 12 months of steady business from asset recovery and insurance companies, and is looking to banks next. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in basically everything we’re doing now.”CipherTrace sells compliance tools to crypto exchanges, government investigators and banks. It compiles intelligence on wallets to help organizations track transactions, but doesn’t share data on individuals.Jevans said it’s up to the courts to unmask individual wallet-holders; his company just helps investigators move from point A to B. Related: Upstart Crypto Tracer Brings ‘Middleware’ to Busy Blockchain Analysis IndustryRolling out specialty intelligence software has been one recent CipherTrace strategy. It launched a sanctions compliance platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects in April as the market for tools used to comply with the Financial Action Task Force “travel rule” is “really heating up,” Jevans said. The global financial watchdog announced rules in 2019 to combat the use of cryptcurrencies in money laundering and funding for terrorists.Another target area has been privacy coins. CipherTrace claims it can occasionally break through the veil of secrecy of monero, a cryptocurrency that has been used by criminals. Jevan said that while his team is “supportive of the monero project,” he insisted the privacy coin is doomed to fail without some degree of oversight and noted that blockchain tracing and compliance tools are necessary if cryptocurrency is going to flourish.“We’re not gonna get the next billion people into the market without these tools,” he said.Securitize Raises $48M in Funding Round Led by Morgan Stanley, Blockchain CapitalFinnish Digital-Asset Lender Tesseract Raises $25M in Series A FundingRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T18:10:25.000Z," Developing countries lack sophisticated financial systems to manage their currencies and are turning to cryptocurrencies as a legal monetary tender. A leader in that movement is El Salvador, which this month passed a bill adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as the nation’s legal tender. Asia Broadband, Inc. (OTC: AABB) is one company that has jumped on the El Salvadoran announcement by declaring its plans to use the country as a springboard to expansion in Central America with the introduction of its AABB Gold token (AABBG).Asia Broadband, a resource company focused on the production, supply and sale of precious and base metals, primarily to Asian markets, recently released AABBG as its mine-to-token gold-backed cryptocurrency. The company will be targeting major Salvadoran retailers to engage in acceptance and processing agreements for customer purchases with the coin.The introduction of cryptocurrencies into countries such as El Salvador and Venezuela come as the U.S. dollar, once viewed as the most stable global currency, has suffered during the COVID pandemic as the Federal Reserve has vastly increased the number of dollars in circulation.“Central banks are increasingly taking actions that may cause harm to the economic stability of El Salvador. To mitigate the negative impact of central banks, it becomes necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency with a supply that cannot be controlled by any central bank and is only altered in accord with objective and calculable criteria,” El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said.Asia Broadband’s planned introduction of AABBG to El Salvador will include opening a satellite office in the country to eventually serve as its Central and South American hub for business development and marketing.El Salvador’s recent adoption of Bitcoin as the country’s legal tender has created a cryptocurrency-focused economy and what Asia Broadband believes to be a tremendous growth opportunity for AABBG and its AABB Wallet.Nearly 70% of El Salvador’s population of 6 million are without bank accounts or credit cards but do have cell phone and internet access across the country, allowing access to the AABB wallet. The company also points to the fact that more than 2 million Salvadorans living in the U.S. send approximately USD 5 billion annually to El Salvador, amounting to more than 20% of the country’s gross domestic product.Anticipating growth in the Latin American market, Asia Broadband is currently developing a Spanish language version of its AABB Wallet.For more information about Asia Broadband and its AABBG cryptocurrency and AABB Wallet, visit www.aabbgoldtoken.com.

2021-06-22T18:13:02.000Z," Regulators in China taking a tougher stance on cryptocurrencies could partially explain the most recent rout in bitcoin prices. But some Wall Street watchers think the U.S. Federal Reserve's new hawkish stance on interest rate policy and bond buying is also playing a key role. ""It is our belief that part of the momentous rally (an important part) has been helped by the Fed’s largess. Bitcoin and other cryptos should rally further on their own over the years, but we believe that they have been pulled forward by the Fed’s stimulus. In other words, we do not think that the stock market is the only asset class that has gotten ahead of itself due to the massive stimulus programs of the past year plus,"" said Miller Tabak chief markets strategist Matt Maley in a new research note. Bitcoin prices have nosedived by 16% to $32,000 since the Fed surprised investors on June 16 by signaling two potential interest rate increases by the end of 2023. Many market watchers surmised the Fed was trying to talk down red-hot asset prices (which have in part been fueled by the ability to borrow money cheaply), and bitcoin is no exception. Bitcoin prices fell below the key $30,000 level on Tuesday, touching $29,458 at the lows as traders continued to digest Fed day and hawkish comments since from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. From the record highs of more than $63,000 hit in mid-April, bitcoin has shed nearly 50% as regulators in China crack down on mining in the country. Negative tweets on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining from Tesla CEO Elon Musk haven't helped bitcoin prices, either.Now that bitcoin prices have breached the important support point of $30,000, traders are bracing for an additional selling wave in the near-term. Warns Maley, ""Bitcoin has touched that $30,000 level (or at least come very close to it) several times over the last month. Therefore, if it drops below that level in any meaningful way, it’s going to be very bearish on a technical basis. Thus the $20,000 level that many pundits have been pointing to recently is not out of the question at all. This will not mean that the bull market is cryptos is over, but a break below $30,000 will be something that will be quite negative on a short-term basis.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

2021-06-22T18:25:47.000Z," The total open interest in the bitcoin futures market is sitting at $11.3 billion, down 59% from its April 13 peak of $27.3 billion according to Arcane Research. The report said the downward trading indicates that institutional investors are being “cautious” at the moment. It also notes that three-month futures in bitcoin are in backwardation, meaning they are traded at a discount to current spot prices. That is generally perceived to be a bearish signal. Open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a share of total bitcoin futures was climbing at the end of May, but is now trading downward. The CME’s open interest is currently sitting at 12.2% of the bitcoin futures market, according to the report. That puts it in fourth place, behind retail platforms Binance (22.5% of total open interest), OKEx (14%) and Bybit (12.9%).Related: Bitcoin Holds $30K Support After Volatile Shakeout; Resistance at $36K“I think it’s safe to say that institutional interest has waned,” said Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at Two Prime. Cox said that institutions remain “hungry” for crypto as a whole, but their ability to step in is limited by the recent volatility in the market. Meanwhile, some note the decline in futures activity indicates that other market participants are also stepping back. “What this shows is a lot of retail traders got burned when the market started to come lower,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG.Nonetheless, Two Prime’s Cox remains optimistic that larger investors will buy the dip. Related: Bitcoin Likely to Be Range-Bound After Rebound From $29K“As things stabilize I would expect to see large institutions announce positions, likely being accumulated into this pullback,” he said. Polkadot on Coinbase Went Up More Than 70% in the Midst of Crypto Market Sell-OffMarket Wrap: Bitcoin Back Above $30K in Volatile Trading SessionRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T18:32:41.000Z," BTC is up 245% and Ethereum is up 730% over a one-year period. Of course, both are now down a lot over the last month. But the price on its own tells us very little information.The efficient market hypothesis would have us believe that information advantages, like knowing what a blockchain is, or thinking that a network with no transactions is worth less than a network with transactions, get absorbed into markets through arbitrage opportunities. If you have an information edge, no matter how fundamental or obvious or small, you act on that edge and get rewarded through profits over some time period. Therefore, incentives force rational actors to rationalize irrational markets.Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.Related: Bitcoin Holds $30K Support After Volatile Shakeout; Resistance at $36KBut let’s not forget that social media and memetics exist, in part, to make machines out of our lizard brains and network them into the limbic system of the internet of attention.The price, then, is not just a cold calculation of truth revealed. Rather, the price is a signal to be politicized, warred over and worshipped. If you can more easily move the sacred number with your heart than with your mind, which would you choose? No need to do math homework. Just join the bannered tribe of the Bitcoin maximalists, Link Marines, XRP Army, Doge army or some other multi-agent Twitter centaur, and tear into anything and everything that stands counter to your narrative.The fact that people dote on price, and do nothing but talk about it – as a flag – is not new. But perhaps the amount of purchasing that is done based on that flag-waving alone is novel with leading cryptocurrencies. Financial rallying cries are now the norm to teach enemies their lesson in financial ruin. Correlations are another data point here. Coin Metrics has a fantastic tool for plotting crypto asset correlations here. We can see correlations across projects starting to converge to the 0.6 to 0.8 range. Assets with very different stories, such as bitcoin, ethereum, Uniswap, Aave, Binance and Yearn are collapsing any difference in performance toward higher and higher correlation.Related: Bitcoin Likely to Be Rangebound After Rebound From $29KPerhaps that signals a lack of discrimination from institutional actors when they take an asset allocation approach. This would imply putting money into a “sector,” rather than into a project. Thus you would put 10% of your hedge fund into crypto, rather than into particular assets. Then, when there is a need to deleverage or rotate into a different position, you would reduce a portion of your overall allocation, and thereby impact all the sub-component parts. But it’s a bit hard to believe. Being pioneers among their peers, the crypto funds playing in the space are immensely sensitive to risk and market structure. Bitcoin’s status as a store of value has retail actors selling off well-performing but non-core assets to park whatever remains into bitcoin. As the market overall has become bearish, selling off winners to pay off collateral calls or to turn off risk starts making sense. This seems more likely, and also sucks.If you want to be rigorous in thinking about crypto networks, what are the metrics to actually track? Bitcoin and ethereum come with very different stories, and thus what to track is quite different. Bitcoin is digitally scarce, and therefore can be viewed as “hard and sound” money. The hardness refers to how difficult it is to create additional units of the currency. It is backed by its mathematical truth – with supply limited as pre-ordained by code. While the Chinese authorities may attempt to stomp out bitcoin mining like a weed, it does little to change the network’s ability to secure transactions and generate a store of wealth for people who want to do so away from their governments.In this way, Bitcoin is a political tool aimed at sovereigns, meant to strip away their monopolies on wealth. To the extent that a country cannot collect taxes, control its economy through monetary policy and otherwise rule its people economically, that country is not sovereign in the medieval sense. When a decentralized internet nation comes with its own decentralized internet currency, and promises of freedom and happiness, citizens of a country have an easily accessible alternative to the hegemon. We may soon find a better social contract with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) than with a corporation or a nation. Thus the sovereign will use force to enforce the social contract it finds existential.Bitcoiners, however, believe market forces to be inexorable, assuming infinite demand. For example, the “Bitcoin Stock to Flow” pricing model takes the schedule of BTC emissions with its halving events and overlaps it nicely on a logarithmic scale with the BTC price. Thus, the harder it is to generate the next bitcoin, the higher the price of bitcoin will be.But maybe this is also just two exponential charts overlaid on top of each other? Like, you take one number and divide it by two and then you take another number and you multiply it by two, and then you mess around with the vertical axis until your time period matches.Another bit of the puzzle, when you know what supply looks like, is to try to project demand. There are various analytics about which types of accounts are selling (e.g., large of small), institutional inflows and outflows, and other leading indicators to transaction count. This is an attempt to quantify how people feel about the future, and all sorts of alchemy exists in looking at social sentiment.In our opinion, still some of the best charts for understanding the current valuation of bitcoin have been developed by Willy Woo and are available here. The NVT (network value to transactions) cap, which is based on historic money flows relative to network value, suggests bitcoin should be worth over $1 trillion. The value of all coins at the price of their last transaction is $370 billion. The market is floating somewhere in the middle.Note, however, that the main variables in all these models are how bitcoin relates to its own value. It is valuable to the extent people paid for it – the store of value – and at what rate they are performing such activity. And frankly, we can’t tell apart correlation and causation, because by design much of finance is recursive, reflexive and self-similar.It is a breath of fresh air to switch from talking about existential geopolitics and who gets to be the money god – a monarch, a president or a computer program – to talking about creative computation.Once you layer in programmability into blockchains, you are no longer constrained into talking about money. Yes, money is lovely. But it is also a mere derivative of actual things that actual people do. Money does not exist without some work that has gone into the tangible world, and then became abstracted into something else.To us, it is that work that is important. While upgrading the transformation function that saves abstractions to be more modern and free is a gigantic opportunity, can’t we have a digitally native economy first instead of worshipping a golden calf?Paying for your sandwich in BTC or Apple stock is not a digitally native economy. Building software that runs on Ethereum, or another bridged computational blockchain, definitely is.Having open-source, mutualized financial engines that provide the best financial functionality in the world is a worthwhile goal. Fixing the original sin of the internet by rewiring human creativity out of attention-eating advertising monsters and into economic exchange seems like a pretty good goal too. Designing, congealing and governing an emerging metaverse to make the cyber expanse feel grounded and worth inhabiting may be the largest goal of all.To that end, we find it much easier to root in Ethereum’s fundamentals because it welcomes non-canon extensions, whether they are scalability networks like Polygon, Optimism or Arbitrum, or whether they are the myriad decentralized applications extending the financial uses of ETH through trading, lending, investing, insurance, structuring and asset management. The more others build, and the easier it is for them to build and therefore generate economic exchange and transactions, the better off everyone becomes. This is like watching the number of applications grow in Apple’s iOS or the number of merchants connected to Alibaba go through the roof.To believe in the future of the crypto economy, you don’t have to believe in stories about sovereigns, digital or flesh. Rather, you have to believe in stories about the benefits of non-coercive peer-to-peer economic exchange. To that end, instead of swapping out old governments for the internet, the thesis is that you are swapping out the old economy for the internet. This then is our favorite chart, showing how Ethereum’s 1-plus million in daily transactions is now combined with another 7 million daily transactions from Polygon.Or maybe this one, showing 135 million contract calls in May – the song of software running code.As the crypto markets continue to display both (1) pronounced volatility and (2) increased correlation between different asset types, it’s important to articulate the main difference between the motivating purpose of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We do not think crypto prices are telling a useful or clear story, so it is worth considering the fundamentals of what one is betting on to become true.Bitcoin and Ethereum/Web3 are aiming for quite different goals and will take very different paths to get there. Perhaps during some beautiful singularity, they will converge. The Twitter universe will yell at you until you comply to its price narrative, so be vigilant and pay attention to core principles. A lot is at stake.Polkadot on Coinbase Went Up More Than 70% in the Midst of Crypto Market Sell-OffMarket Wrap: Bitcoin Back Above $30K in Volatile Trading SessionRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T19:52:24.000Z," Old crypto hands have been through so many waves of China FUD they might shrug off the current round of anti-cryptocurrency enforcement there as insignificant. Sure, the market is crashing, in part, because of the news, but we’re also coming off a major market top. It’s all just part of the cycle, right?Unfortunately, that thinking seems suddenly and dramatically outdated. China is more serious about this anti-crypto crackdown than it has been in the past, and the impacts could be more lasting and deeper.David Z. Morris is CoinDesk’s chief insights columnist.Related: Bitcoin Holds $30K Support After Volatile Shakeout; Resistance at $36KWe’ve already seen evidence of a new kind of seriousness in the exodus of cryptocurrency miners from China in recent weeks. The good news is that, as Nic Carter has broken down for CoinDesk, the big miner migration will not have a defining influence on the robustness of the Bitcoin network. In fact, it could even be a net long-term positive if it spreads mining, and its risks, to more countries. And there’s no strong, direct line from mining activity to the market price of bitcoin.But mining is less than half the story here: China is also effectively restricting cryptocurrency trading with the same renewed ferocity. On Monday, Chinese financial authorities reminded major banks and fintech companies they weren’t supposed to be facilitating cryptocurrency-related transactions. After the meeting, China’s central bank (PBOC) issued a public statement urging banks to crack down harder on them.These were rules first laid out in 2013, according to ABC News. But in May, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) reminded everyone it really meant it, and the Monday meeting seems to have driven the point home. The Agricultural Bank of China, for instance, said on Monday it would implement a due diligence process to spot cryptocurrency-related transactions. Detection of such activity, AgBank said, could lead to account suspension.It’s important to note this scrutiny would likely fall on individuals as much or more than on cryptocurrency businesses. That’s because such businesses are thin on the ground in China proper: Most notably, cryptocurrency exchanges were banned from the country in 2017, leading to the shutdown of domestic operations by the likes of Bobby Lee’s BTCC.Related: Bitcoin Likely to Be Rangebound After Rebound From $29KBut those shutdowns, for the most part, shifted Chinese fiat-crypto flows to over-the-counter (OTC) desks run by the offshore exchanges Huobi and OKEx. Those gateways allow Chinese individuals to swap yuan for USDT or bitcoin, then move that crypto to international non-fiat exchanges like Binance for further speculation. This round of statements from PBOC cites OTC desks specifically for the first time, according to The Block’s Wolfie Zhao, and includes stronger language around possible suspension of their banking privileges.While China has not banned the ownership of cryptocurrency, stronger enforcement could also damp interest among individual speculators by increasing the risk, or perceived risk, of individual punishment. Possible punitive measures include more than losing a bank account: Though it’s not spelled out in the current round of statements, it seems likely an individual involved in a flagged transaction could also be permanently downgraded in China’s (also nebulous) “social credit” system, a blacklist that can restrict access to everything from airline flights to high-speed internet, apparently with little in the way of due process.Even talking about cryptocurrency seems suddenly less acceptable to Chinese authorities. Multiple reports say accounts focused on the subject have been banned from social media platforms including Weibo. One Chinese crypto commentator referred to the social-media crackdown as “judgment day” for crypto thought leaders in China. That seems likely to further damp interest in crypto speculation, since social media is so key to generating interest in new projects.This could mean real, long-term downward pressure on crypto prices. According to a 2020 Chainalysis report, more than 30% of global crypto trading takes place in East Asia, a share that is dominated by China. Losing a double-digit percentage of global volume would be particularly bad for the smallest projects.Some might even see a deterrent to individual crypto trading in recent high-level actions against business figures. Less than a year ago, Alibaba founder Jack Ma was preparing for the initial public offering of Ant Group, a payments spin-off of the e-commerce platform. Authorities dramatically kiboshed that deal, allegedly in response to Ma’s defiant statements towards financial regulators. Ma, until last year the most famous technology entrepreneur in China, is now basically invisible, reportedly spending his time painting and doing charity work. Life comes at you fast, especially in an authoritarian society.Such dramatic actions take on an outsized role in a system like China’s, where there can be big gaps between the law on paper and the law in practice. Historian Michel Foucault argued that the rise of dramatic and cruel public punishments like quartering in early modern Europe were meant to not just inflict pain on offenders but instill fear in observers, warning them against making the same mistake.While there may still be space for cryptocurrency in China, it seems the CCP authorities have finally concluded they have little to gain from nurturing anti-authoritarian technology. On the whole, their loss could be the world’s gain but there are still likely turbulent waters ahead.Polkadot on Coinbase Went Up More Than 70% in the Midst of Crypto Market Sell-OffMarket Wrap: Bitcoin Back Above $30K in Volatile Trading SessionRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T20:06:36.000Z," Collapsing below $28,000 would be bearish and support a target near $10,000.BITCOIN DAILY CHART: Bitcoin dipped briefly below $30,000 to test critical support surrounding $28,000. This area must hold to maintain the potential for an advance to fresh highs (above $65,000) by year-end. A continued breakdown below $28,000 would confirm a new bear market in Bitcoin and subsequent crypto-winter.BEARISH CASE: One could argue that Bitcoin is forming a bearish head and shoulder top. From a technical standpoint, the shoulders sit a little too low for my liking. Nevertheless, the pattern is symmetrical and warrants our attention. Prices need to hold the $28,000 level to prevent a waterfall collapse. The minimum target for this pattern would be $10,000 upon a confirmed breakdown.Though my work still supports one final rally towards $90,000 by year-end, the crackdown in China and brewing regulatory pressures in the U.S. may prove overwhelming.Longer-term, I am bullish on complex distributed systems and blockchain technology but feel more advanced protocols with programmability (smart contracts) are better investment choices.AG Thorson is a registered CMT and expert in technical analysis.

2021-06-22T20:44:17.000Z," Analysts have been carefully watching over the past week to see if Bitcoin would form a ""death cross."" And on June 21, the cryptocurrency passed that threshold.  A “death cross"" certainly doesn’t sound good, but what is it exactly? Crosses are technical patterns in price charts: They point to a rapid shift in price compared to long-term performance of a stock, cryptocurrency, or the overall market. When the 50-day average physically intersects the 200-day moving average on a chart, it forms a cross, and it can serve as indicator of future price movement. Golden crosses can point to impending bull movements. A death cross is a little more unsettling, as it has been known to precede some of the worst bear markets in history. “It's not a welcome sight for bulls when you see the formation,” Nathan Cox, Chief Investment Officer at digital asset-focused investment firm Two Prime, said in an email. And yet, the death cross is exactly what emerged on Bitcoin’s price charts yesterday, and it’s “top of mind for all technical analysts,” Cox said.On June 21, Bitcoin’s 50-day average fell below its 200-day moving average, triggering a death cross signal and causing reason for concern to some investors. On Tuesday, its price briefly fell below $29,026, temporarily erasing its 2021 gains, before climbing back above $32,000.There could be a host of contributors to the decline. For one, China has recently been cracking down on crypto mining, and it banned financial institutions from offering crypto services earlier this year. Bitcoin tends to be hyper-sensitive to headlines, particularly those involving Elon Musk or Tesla. Causes for the downturn aside, the emergence of the death cross on Bitcoin’s price charts has some investors on edge or perhaps moving to sell their stakes. Others have decided it's a good time to buy, or simply to stick with the pre-existing strategy. Death crosses reflect significant decline in stock or market prices, and have in some cases pointed to further downturns. Death crosses have previously signaled bearish behavior across the broader markets (think: 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008).For Bitcoin, this isn’t its first run-in with the death cross signal.Bitcoin experienced a severe drawdown in March 2020—but by the time the death cross signal emerged on the coin’s price charts, Bitcoin had already moved past its lows, Cox points out. The price rallied shortly thereafter.Bitcoin’s most substantial death cross was in the wake of the 2017-2018 crash, Cox notes. That’s when Bitcoin dropped around 60% between December and February. The death cross occurred on March 30, 2018, but lows had already been reached. Bitcoin rallied over the next month.By definition, the death cross is an indicator of what has already happened—it isn’t always an accurate signal for bearish movements still ahead. Periods of decline can also be followed by intense gains, or even a golden cross.The death cross may be regarded as a reliable indicator for impending low prices, but it’s not a perfect one, Cox said.Many crypto investors are used to market swings, and some see a downturn like this as a good opportunity to increase their long-term positions.At Voyager Digital, a crypto trading app, Bitcoin is in the top 10 of net buys of digital assets in the past 24 hours, and the top over the last seven days, according to Voyager CEO Steve Ehrlich. “Historically, crypto has emerged even stronger on the other side of dip cycles,” Ehrlich said in an email.As for how long a downturn could last, Cox says a rebound may depend on some of the external factors at play, such as whether Bitcoin miners in China are able to relocate quickly.“If the narrative doesn't change,” he said, “we could see continued pressure on digital assets,” This story was originally featured on Fortune.comNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-22T21:22:09.000Z," Today’s market appeared to grapple with sinking Bitcoin prices before tossing the issue aside in favor of the growth trajectory we’d been on during today’s pre-market. This was a muted version of the bullish sentiment we saw in yesterday’s trading, where market participants took the initiative to mostly wipe out the losses suffered Friday of last week.Melting a bit into the close, the Dow was +0.20% on the day, the S&P 500 +0.51%, the Nasdaq +0.79% and the Russell 2000  +0.43%. Nevertheless, it’s a new record high close for the Nasdaq. Microsoft MSFT also became the second $2 trillion company by market cap.Bitcoin had been mounting an heroic comeback this afternoon, bouncing back more than 1000 points higher than yesterday’s close after briefly dipping a toe sub-29K early this afternoon. This was the lowest point seen for Bitcoin since January 1st. Investors seemed to be shrugging off the draconian approach to crypto mining demonstrated in China over the past weekend… but then the crypto skidded as the stock market’s closing bell rang, -0.14% on the day.Fed Chair Jay Powell’s testimony before a House select sub-committee today gave him the opportunity to solidify the notions brought up in last week’s outlook on monetary policy. Unfortunately, it also gave opportunities to partisan representatives to lambaste their political rivals based on whatever Powell was answering questions about at a given time. Powell’s calm demeanor serves him well in public events like these; however, those looking for a deeper reveal on tapering or interest rates were surely disappointed.For the most part, the recovery according to Powell rests largely on the labor market, on which he says, “We have a long way to go.” While reps from the GOP were keen to blame Democrats for unemployment benefits to keep from filling still-9 million job openings, Powell instead cited the wide adoption of Covid vaccines being essential to maximum employment. Democrats looking for Powell to sign off on broadband initiatives in its infrastructure bill were met with lukewarm enthusiasm, at best.In terms of inflation, which the Chair still considers transitory, Powell cited big price increases in things like used automobiles, airline tickets and hotel rooms. “These are not the kinds of things that lead to high inflation over time,” he said. Powell mentioned the supply side of the economy was caught “flat-footed” coming out of the pandemic, and the sharp increase in prices mostly came in those segments of the economy most directly affected by it. By definition, these forms of inflation would be transitory.If anything, Powell represented himself as clear and focused on the issues, with a methodical approach toward addressing solutions. This stood in vast contrast with elected officials on Capitol Hill, who looked for chances to play politics about the issues rather than press for further clarity from the Fed Chair about his biases for decision-making going forward.Seasonally adjusted Existing Home Sales for May fell month over month, as expected, but not by as much as anticipated. A total of 5.80 million “used” homes being sold last month marks the fourth-straight month lower, -0.9%. While demand remains high, the median price for an existing home on the market rose 23.6% year over year to $350,000 — the first time in history prices have breached $350K on average. This has had a pronounced effect on buyers, especially those getting into the market for the first time.Only the Midwest posted existing home sales gains in May, which points clearly to rising expenses in housing in places like the West and South. Homes for sale fell 20.6% from a year ago to 1.23 million. And with difficulties in the New Homes space, as homebuilders beg off new construction until input costs cool down, existing homeowners don’t seem too excited about putting themselves back into the housing market these days, either.Hmmm… perhaps Congress should have asked Jay Powell whether he thinks record-high existing home prices were still in the “transitory inflation” column?Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2021-06-22T21:49:47.000Z," Jan Van Eck, the CEO of asset manager Van Eck Associate, urged the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund due to investor demand.What Happened: According to a Tuesday CNBC report, Van Eck said that the regulator “should approve a Bitcoin ETF” since “the only alternative investors have is a closed-end fund that trades it at a 40% premium or 20% discount.”According to CNBC, he was presumably hinting at the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC), known to be often trading at a premium or discount.Van Eck’s comments follow SEC’s decision to yet again delay the regulator’s decision to approve the VanEck Bitcoin Trust for the second time, requesting comment from interested parties on how this decision could impact markets.The asset manager’s CEO also mentioned Bitcoin futures, claiming that they “aren't any better,” adding a futures-based fund “underperformed Bitcoin by 22% last year and 8% this year.”What Else: Ric Edelman, the No. 1 registered investment advisor in the United States and the founder of Edelman Financial Engines, also said that integrating Bitcoin into portfolios would “be so much easier and simpler if there was a Bitcoin ETF.”At the same time, he admits that investors have to act instead of waiting because “by the time the SEC says yes to it, Bitcoin might be $100,000.”Read also: What Is Crypto ETFs?“You’re going to miss out, so, you’ve got to move on with the investment opportunities that do exist,” he concluded.See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from Benzinga2.3M UK Consumers Hold Crypto: FCA Finds An 'Increase In Ownership'McLaren Racing Partners With Tezos Blockchain To Launch NFT Ecosystem© 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-06-22T22:12:54.000Z," Cryptocurrencies gyrated sharply Tuesday, extending a recent run of wild swings.For the first time since January, bitcoin — the world’s most popular digital coin — briefly dropped below $30,000, a key level that technical analysts monitor. It erased its gains for 2021 before recovering to trade at $32,481.93, according to CoinGecko, a crypto market data site. Bitcoin at one point shed more than 10% to trade as low as $29,154.73, losing more than half its value since hitting a record high in April. That's after a tremendous performance in 2020, with the digital currency surging more than 300%.Other cryptos joined the sell-off before paring losses, with ethereum, the second-biggest digital currency by market value, slumping more than 5%. Now it's ticked up 0.7% over the past 24 hours.The selling also spilled over to smaller coins like Dogecoin, a meme-inspired crypto that at one point tumbled more than 25% to erase all of its gains since April. It has since cut declines and is down 1% in the past day. Here’s what drove the latest sell-off:Will Dogecoin go up or bust?: Here are 700 million reasons its bubble will burst.Bitcoin is up, then down: But exactly how does it work?After topping $64,000 in April, bitcoin has struggled to reclaim its all-time highs since then following a series of events. It came under pressure in May after tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has driven traders into frenzies by mentioning cryptos at times, said Tesla will stop using Bitcoin as a form of payment over concerns of the cryptocurrency's impact on fossil fuels.Since then, cryptos have gyrated as coins such as ethereum typically to move in tandem with bitcoin.In early June, bitcoin fell further amid concerns of its use in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. Bitcoin, for instance, briefly touched $40,000 last week and fell again Monday after China's central bank deepened a crackdown on cryptocurrencies. China's central bank said it ordered some banks and payment firms, including China Construction Bank and Alipay, to crack down further on cryptocurrency trading.Bitcoin shed more than 10% on Monday, its largest one-day drop in over a month.With Tuesday’s losses, bitcoin has slid more than 50% from its all-time high above $64,000 in mid-April. To be sure, bitcoin is still up more than 200% over the past 12 months.Ethereum has shed nearly 57% from its all time high of $4,356.99 in May while Dogecoin has shed more than 70% since it touched a record of about 73 cents last month, according to CoinGecko.Cryptos could be poised for further declines based on a closely watched indicator, according to technical analysts.Over the weekend, bitcoin formed a death cross, a chart pattern that signals the potential for a major sell-off. Bitcoin’s average price over the past 50 days fell below its 200-day moving average, which means there could be more pressure on the digital coin.""Long-term bitcoin bulls are getting nervous as a break of $30,000 could see a tremendous amount of momentum selling,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange trading service OANDA, said in a recent note. ""Many traders have waited for one more push lower, which could see crypto traders wait for a plunge towards the $20,000-$25,000 area.""Elon Musk, Snoops Dogg and Mark Cuban love Dogecoin. Should you?: How to stay safe when investing in cryptocurrencySome analysts think the May sell-off in bitcoin weakened institutional demand, which is likely to keep prices under pressure in the near term.""There is little doubt that the boom and bust dynamics of the past weeks represent a setback to the institutional adoption of crypto markets and in particular of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a report earlier this month.Still, some are using the recent decline in bitcoin as a buying opportunity. On Monday, MicroStrategy, enterprise software company, said it scooped up an additional $489 million worth of bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 105,085 bitcoins.First-time investors should proceed with caution. Piling all of your nest egg into something as volatile as cryptocurrencies poses big risks to your retirement, experts say. Wealth managers and finance experts have long been skeptical of these speculative investments for amateur investors due to their extreme swings. In 2013, bitcoin began trading around $13 and spiked to more than $1,000 by December. In late 2017, the digital token surged to nearly $20,000, before crashing to almost $3,000 the following year. What followed was a dizzying rise to above $64,000 in April 2021.Dogecoin has seen similar booms and swoons. It has ridden a similar Reddit-driven wave as stocks like GameStop and AMC in recent months, accelerated by a series of tweets by Musk, who was pumping the cryptocurrency. Cryptos are now in 401(k)s: Are they the right investment for your nest egg?Even with the latest declines, the sharp rise in the value of bitcoin earlier this year has some analysts worried about a potential bubble in the cryptocurrency market, with bitcoin's price – at one point – more than doubling since the start of 2021.About 81% of fund managers polled in a recent Bank of America survey in June said bitcoin was still a bubble. That’s up from about 75% of managers who said so in May.“While there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will recover this time, those who believe in its long-term future may well see this decline as an opportunity to invest more,” James Royal, analyst at Bankrate.com, said in a note.""Cryptocurrency traders, especially individuals, need to know the risks of what they own,"" Royal added. ""In some cases, the risks could be a complete loss of their investment.”This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bitcoin: Cryptocurrency briefly crashed again.

2021-06-22T23:28:13.000Z," What Happened: Shenzhen-based Bitcoin miner BIT Mining (NYSE: BTCM) has already shipped some of its mining equipment outside China, according to a press release from the company.The company reported that 320 mining machines with a capacity of 18.2 PH/s had been delivered to a facility in Kazakhstan, which is expected to be fully operational by June 27.A second and third batch, totaling 2,600 mining machines with a theoretical maximum total hash rate capacity of 102.3 PH/s, are also expected to be delivered to Kazakhstan before July 1, 202.Why It Matters: The company’s overseas deployment strategy was put into effect after it received a notice from the State Grid Sichuan Ganzi Electric Power supplier notifying them that the power supply would be suspended on June 19.BIT Mining’s Chinese subsidiary was one of the 26 Bitcoin miners that were forcibly shut down by local authorities on Sunday after a government crackdown on crypto mining and trading in the region further intensified.""We are committed to protecting the environment and lowering our carbon footprint.

2021-06-23T07:45:13.000Z," Bitcoin has recently made an attempt to settle below the key support level at $30,000 but lost momentum and rebounded closer to the resistance at $35,000.This is a very positive development for crypto bulls as Bitcoin’s move below $30,000 would have had a serious negative impact on the crypto market.Not surprisingly, other cryptocurrencies are gaining ground. Ethereum is currently trying to settle back above the $2,000 level. Dogecoin is testing the resistance at $0.2150. XRP enjoys a very strong rebound and is trying to move back above $0.65.Bitcoin Dominance, which shows Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of total crypto market capitalization, has pulled back a bit from recent highs near 48%. However, its trend remains bullish, and it looks that Bitcoin has a decent chance to increase its market share in case it manages to get back above the resistance at $35,000 and move towards the $40,000 level.Bitcoin managed to get back above the resistance at $32,000 and is trying to get to the test of the next resistance level which is located at $35,000. In case Bitcoin manages to settle above the resistance at $35,000, it will head towards the resistance at the 20 EMA at $36,300.A successful test of the resistance at the 20 EMA will open the way to the test of the next resistance level at $38,000. If Bitcoin gets above this level, it will head towards the key resistance level at $40,000. This resistance level has already been tested many times and proved its strength. In addition, the 50 EMA is located at $40,500, so Bitcoin will likely face strong resistance in the $40,000 – $40,500 area.On the support side, Bitcoin needs to settle back below $32,000 to have a chance to get to another test of the key support level at $30,000. A move below $30,000 will push Bitcoin towards the recent lows at $28,800. A successful test of this level will signal that Bitcoin is ready to continue its downside move.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX Empire China Is No Longer An Option?

2021-06-23T07:49:07-04:00," Bitcoin rose above $34,000 on Wednesday, taking it well above the critical $30,000 level that it breached on Tuesday and allowing it to recoup its year-to-date losses as long-term Bitcoin believers held on to their stash of the digital token.Bitcoin was up 15.88% at $34,252 in morning trading on Wednesday. Ether, the No. 2 digital currency, was up 14.22% at $2,005.36, while XRP was up 23% at 65.14 cents. Dogecoin, the meme-currency that has suffered extreme losses over the past week amid cryptocurrency market turbulence, was up 38.48% at 23.82 cents.Shares of cryptocurrency-related companies including Coinbase  (COIN) , Riot Blockchain  (RIOT) - Get Report, Marathon Digital  (MARA) - Get Report and Bit Digital  (BTBT) - Get Report were also moving higher. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest took advantage of the Bitcoin downturn on Tuesday by buying up another 214,718 shares of Coinbase, pushing its holdings to 4.7 million shares. Bitcoin has lost more than 50% from its mid-April high of almost $65,000. The digital coin started 2021 trading around $29,000 following a fourfold increase in 2020.Such trading signals “that Bitcoin traders could find themselves in choppy waters for weeks to come,” Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments, told Bloomberg.Jim Cramer: MicroStrategy Has Become a Binary Play on BitcoinTheStreet's Jim Cramer said on his program on CNBC on Monday that he offloaded most of his Bitcoin holdings amid concerns over the recent crackdown on crypto mining by the Chinese government and Bitcoin’s role in some ransomware attacks.“Sold almost all of my bitcoin. Don’t need it,” Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street” on Monday, more than two months after he first indicated he trimmed his position and paid off a home mortgage with those profits.Chart-watchers including TheStreet's Bret Kenwell said Bitcoin, which failed to stay above $40,000 last week, could have a tough time finding support in the $20,000 range following its drop below $30,000. ""We have to respect the $30,000 area as support,"" Kenwell wrote. ""It’s been support and until it breaks, it remains support. However, the more times a level is tested, the more suspect it becomes of failing.""If Bitcoin were to lose the $30,000 mark and the 50-week moving average, it’s hard to say where the bottom may rest.""Why This Former NYSE Trader Is Waiting for Bitcoin to Hit $30,000"
2021-06-23T08:29:08.000Z," By Samuel IndykInvesting.com – The price of Bitcoin rebounded above $34,000 on Wednesday, a day after the sell off which saw the price drop below $30,000 for the first time since January.There were some fears that a drop below $30,000 would have opened the doors to further weakness, with some analysts forecasting a drop below $20,000, but that scenario has not played out so far.Instead, after dropping below $29,000 yesterday, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have staged a rebound.“It has probably weathered the storm in the near term, and I'll pick some numbers out of the matrix and say $30,000 to $40,000 will cover the rest of the week/weekend,” said Jeffrey Halley, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA.Bitcoin has had a rollercoaster year, hitting a high near $65,000 in April before paring back to its current level amid slowing institutional adoption and prospects of tighter regulation in the cryptocurrency market.The latest crackdown in China was the likely catalyst for the sell off earlier this week as mining companies in Sichuan province were forced to shutter their doors and the PBoC warned some banks and payment firms to stamp out transactions related to digital assets.The environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining and transactions has also recently weighed on prices after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said his company would stop accepting Bitcoin due to the energy use of the network. It is estimated the Bitcoin network uses as much power as a country the size of Sweden or Argentina.With companies under pressure to satisfy ESG investors, firms may be more cautious about holding or dealing in Bitcoin and other energy intensive crypto assets.At 13:08BST, Bitcoin was trading around $33,900, up 8.3% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was trading around $2,000 after hitting a low near $1,700 on Tuesday.Related ArticlesBitcoin rebounds after drop below $30,000Crypto Mining Crackdown in Iran, 7,000 Computers Seized3 reasons why Solana bounced harder than Bitcoin and EthereumRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

We have watched the collapse of bitcoin to levels viewed as shocking, even if they are still more than double where they were not that long ago. We've dealt with Fed officials making it clear that they are no longer on the side of the bulls or the bears. They are on the side of job growth, but are wary of inflation. We've seen the end of the rush to get vaccines, which means that millions of people are going to get the new COVID variant, because there is no natural immunity to it. We've watched as the hopes for an infrastructure bill have collapsed.

They included a “renowned home-shopping channel show host” who owed over $17,000 in tax and held $440,000 worth of crypto.The seizure forms part of a broader crackdown on the crypto industry in South Korea in a bid by the country to tackle fraud and money laundering.Crypto exchanges have until September to register with the financial regulator as virtual-asset service providers so the legality of their operations can be determined.South Korean Banks to ‘Review’ Partnerships With Crypto ExchangesSouth Korean Exchanges Halt Trading on Certain Cryptos as Regulatory Pressure MountsBanks in South Korea Instructed to Treat Crypto Exchanges as High-Risk ClientsSouth Korea Looks to Ban Crypto Exchange Employees From Trading on Their Own PlatformsRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

The second major resistance level sits at $35,850.A fall through the $31,729 pivot would bring the first major support level at $30,090 into play.Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$29,000 levels and the 62% FIB of $27,237. The second major support level sits at $27,608.Looking beyond the support and resistance levels, the 50 EMA narrowed on the 100 and the 200 through the morning, supporting the mid-morning rally.We have also seen the 100 EMA flatten on the 200 EMA adding further support.A further narrowing of the 50 EMA on the 100 EMA would bring sub-$35,000 levels into play.Key going into the afternoon, however, would be a move back through the morning high $34,486 to $34,500 levels.This article was originally posted on FX Empire Best ETFs For July 2021  Daily Gold News: Wednesday, June 23 – Gold Extends Consolidation Below $1,800  USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis – March Top at 110.966 Potential Triggerpoint for Upside Acceleration  China Is No Longer An Option?

2021-06-23T10:30:51.000Z," While bitcoin seems to have found a bottom, a quick rally to record highs looks unlikely, analysts told CoinDesk on Wednesday, saying the cryptocurrency now faces price consolidation.“Bitcoin looks to have bottomed out, having digested most negative news during the recent sell-off from $41,000 to $29,000,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger said.Prices topped $41,000 early last week before turning south in the latter half after the Federal Reserve’s unexpected hawkish tilt on interest rates.Related: Bukele’s Bitcoin Blunder for El SalvadorBearish sentiment strengthened on Monday after the People’s Bank of China reiterated its crypto banking ban in the wake of the Chinese government’s crackdown on crypto mining. Bitcoin extended the previous week’s sell-off, hitting five-month lows near $29,000 during early U.S. hours Tuesday.Still, prices had bounced back to $32,000 by the day’s end (23:59 UTC). At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands near $33,730, a 3.9% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.With the quick recovery, bitcoin has re-entered the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000 established in the aftermath of the mid-May sell-off. Kruger expects consolidation to continue for some time unless “there is another major bearish China headline.”Stack Funds is also maintaining a cautious stance despite signs of bargain hunting.Related: Why Bitcoin Could Be Good for El Salvador“We have noticed that whales [large investors] are re-entering the market as risk appetite returns,” it said in a research noted published Wednesday.

However, “we will keep a close eye on bitcoin’s price post options expiry, and it will be interesting to see how this will unfold in the first week of July, the start of the third quarter.”Bitcoin options worth more than $2 billion are set to expire Friday. The monthly expiries have gained prominence this year as volatility-inducing events.According to Nick Mancini, a research analyst at Trade the Chain, a continued rally in bitcoin needs a weaker U.S. dollar.Bitcoin has been one of the major beneficiaries of the Fed’s massive stimulus programs launched a year ago. So a continued recovery in the dollar on fears of an impending Fed tightening could hamper bitcoin’s progress.“Bitcoin and the dollar index have developed an inverse relationship since the last week’s Federal Reserve meeting,” Mancini said. “We believe that if bitcoin wants to gain strength, given current market conditions, the dollar needs to become weaker.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, has risen by 1.43% since the Fed meeting. Bitcoin, meantime, is down at least 10% from the pre-Fed highs.Some observers say the Fed taper fears are here to stay and could keep bitcoin’s gains in check. “Concerns about the outlook for Fed policy and the impact of a shift to less-accommodative policy on account of rising inflation that may not be transitory pose downside risk to bitcoin’s price,” Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.Also read: China’s Anti-Crypto Crackdown Is Different This Time At a minimum, bitcoin needs to see a break above $41,325 to suggest we’ve bottomed,” Kruger said.

2021-06-23T10:38:24.000Z," (Bloomberg) -- Bitmain Technologies Ltd. has suspended sales of machines for spot delivery globally, aiming to prop up local prices after crypto miners fleeing Beijing’s crackdown dumped used mining rigs on the market.The world’s biggest maker of Bitcoin machines told the local mining community Wednesday it has stopped selling new equipment after prices for top-tier rigs plunged by about 75% since April. By postponing sales, it could help miners exiting the industry get better prices for their machines. Bitmain could also benefit if the reduced supply buoys prices over the longer term for new machines.The firm said it will continue to sell gear for future delivery of devices used to mine smaller altcoins. A company spokesman confirmed the decision, which was reported earlier by local blogs, without saying when business will resume.In May, China’s State Council -- its cabinet -- called for a renewed crackdown on Bitcoin trading and mining activities. Local governments in places from northern Inner Mongolia to hydro-rich Sichuan acted quickly to sever power for mining facilities. The unprecedented crackdown is spurring more and more major miners to uproot or abandon their operations, a growing exodus that’s rocking cryptocurrencies globally while flooding the domestic market with cheap machines. The Bitcoin network’s computer power has suffered a plunge in recent weeks amid the disruption.On the second-hand market, top-tier mining machines developed by companies including Bitmain and rival Whatsminer are now sold at around 150 yuan ($23) per THash/second -- the reference unit for their computing power -- down from 600 yuan in April when Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $64,870, according to Arthur Li, founder of Bitmain-backed mining startup Sai Technology.Last week, Bitmain hosted a closed-door event with hundreds of miner clients at a Chengdu Hotel. The firm pledged to serve as a matchmaker to help miners hook up with data centers in countries like the U.S. and Kazakhstan.Canaan Inc., a much smaller Bitmain competitor, said Wednesday it would start to mine Bitcoin by itself as a way to optimize revenue and strengthen inventory management.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.Related QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-23T11:00:00.000Z," The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the organization that represents most of the world’s central banks, panned bitcoin in its Annual Economic Report, saying the cryptocurrency has few redeeming qualities. The bank offered a stiff criticism of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general in a chapter from the report published Wednesday ahead of its full release on June 29. Cryptocurrencies are “speculative assets rather than money” and are used in many cases to facilitate financial crime such as money laundering and ransomware attacks.“Bitcoin in particular has few redeeming public interest attributes when also considering its wasteful energy footprint,” the report said.Related: Bank of Israel Has Already Tested a Digital ShekelThe report arrived less than two weeks after the BIS’ Basel Committee indicated the risk level it assigns to crypto assets by proposing that banks with exposure to them should set aside capital to cover any losses.Stablecoins, which are designed be less volatile than other crypto assets by being backed by fiat currencies, also came under scrutiny. The report called them an “attempt to import credibility,” and said that they are “only as good as the governance behind the promise of the backing” and that they threaten to “fragment the liquidity of the monetary system.”CBDCs “moving from concept to design”Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are highlighted as part of a triple-pronged threat to mainstream financial services, alongside disruption by big tech.The BIS set these threats against the backdrop of growing interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which have drawn the interest of most central banks around the world.Related: Banque de France Extends Wholesale CBDC ExperimentCBDCs are moving from concept to design, the report said, and could reshape the institution of money. The bank said digital cash should be designed with the public interest in mind, ensuring an “open payment platform” beneath the shadow of a competitive level playing field.It noted that the benefits of a CBDC depend on the competitive structure of the underlying payment system and data-governance arrangements. CBDCs built on digital identification could improve cross-border payments, limiting the risks of currency substitution, it said. According to the BIS, CBDCs would function optimally if they are based on a two-tier system where the majority of customer-facing activity is taken on by commercial banks and other payment providers.Three months ago, the bank released a detailed research note outlining the importance of countries collaborating to eliminate traditional banking frictions for CBDCs.The bank also noted the most “promising design” for everyday use of CBDCs is if they were built atop an identity scheme, whereby data privacy would be safeguarded while staving off illicit activity. While not entirely new concepts, the discussion shows CBDCs, in the eyes of the bank for central banks, are on their radar.See also: BIS Researchers Grapple With Implications of Interoperable CBDCsEuropean Central Bank Can Better Protect Digital Payment Privacy, Exec Board Member SaysBank of England: Any UK CBDC Will Be ‘Tens of Thousands’ Times More Efficient Than BitcoinRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-23T11:01:02.000Z," LONDON (Reuters) - Only 10% of institutional investment firms surveyed by JPMorgan trade cryptocurrencies, with nearly half labelling the emerging asset class as ""rat poison"" or predicting it would be a temporary fad.   Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, fell to a five-month low on Tuesday, extending losses from China's deepening crackdown on mining and trading cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said it would like to see more regulation around trading in the space.   Bitcoin was up 5% around $34,000 as of 1045 GMT on Wednesday.   Of those firms who did not invest, 80% did not expect to start investing or trading in cyptocurrencies, according to the survey conducted at JPMorgan's Macro, Quantitative and Derrivatives conference, attended by some 3,000 investors from around 1,500 institutions.   However, asked about their personal investments, 40% of the investors said they were active in cryptocurrencies.   Four-fifths of investors also expected regulators to get tougher on the asset class, while a whopping 95% of them believed fraud in crypto world was ""somewhat or very much prevalent"", the survey released late on Tuesday found.   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has in the past characterised bitcoin as ""rat poison squared"". One third in the JPM survey agreed with that view. Another 16% thought it was a temporary fad.   In other findings, investors said they expected the U.S. benchmark stocks index S&P 500 to trade between 4,200 to 4,600 points by the end of 2021 and see a dial back in central bank stimulus and inflation as key market risks. S&P 500 closed at 4,246.44 on Tuesday.   (Reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan; Editing by Karin Strohecker anad Alison Williams) Related QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-23T11:20:37.000Z," The problem with coming up with a value of bitcoin is how can you arrive at one? As its critics point out, there is no intrinsic value. There are no future cash flows to discount, like a stock, because there are no cash flows at all.One way is to come up with the cost of extraction — just as for a metal like gold or silver — using the cost of electricity and the associated computing costs required to mine a bitcoin. Another is to come up with an estimate of the global “anti-fiat” market, arriving at a market share, and then working backward.But a third way would be through technical analysis, which involves trying to discern patterns in the charts of price and volume. Like bitcoin itself, technical analysis can be waved away as some hocus pocus that only has value because people think it has value. But if you believe in the world of Fibonacci retracement and Bollinger Bands, read on.Louis Navellier, the chairman and founder of fund manager Navellier & Associates, says he has identified two head-and-shoulders formations that he thinks suggest bitcoin will fall below $10,000. Navellier says when he asks individual investors about why they invested in bitcoin, it was more often than not because the price was going up. “If they bought it just because it was going up, they are also likely to sell it because it is going down. I think a break below $30,000 will lead to major downside, as the vast majority of trading in 2021 was done above that level, leading to what traders call ‘overhead supply,'” he says.The leverage in bitcoin — sometimes as much as 100:1 — also would exacerbate any decline, he says. “When it crashes this time around, it will be more brutal due to the large number of individual investors involved,” says Navellier.Bitcoin

2021-06-23T12:07:12.000Z," Investors have been placing their bets on bitcoin for quite some time now. However, bitcoin price recently dropped like a stone. The cryptocurrency has now lost almost half of its value since the all-time high touched in the month of April, easily dampening investors’ sentiment and slowing down activity on the blockchain significantly.By the way, bitcoin is known for its wild swings. In 2017, bitcoin experienced a similar pattern. Bitcoin prices crashed after scaling upward and it nearly took three years for the prices to hit new highs. Nonetheless, this time around, bitcoin prices were affected by a crackdown by China’s central bank on cryptocurrencies.The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) advised China’s major financial institutions to implement stricter restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. It’s worth pointing out that crypto exchanges actually have been pushed out of China but over-the-counter (OTC) platforms continue to receive payment from China investors and buy cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, on their behalf.Meanwhile, Ant Group’s payment platform Alipay and Agricultural Bank of China have assured to step up their initiatives to root out crypto transactions, per PBOC’s requirements. Correspondingly, China’s State Council said that it will tighten restrictions on both producers and traders of bitcoin, which may further lead to a drop in its price. Thus, avoiding investments in bitcoin seems prudent at the moment.Let us also admit that the future value of bitcoin is dependent on how widely it is accepted as a form of currency. And currently, it’s still not universally an accepted form of currency. Meanwhile, investing in S&P 500 stocks at present seems judicious. The S&P 500 index largely comprises large-cap U.S. equities, making them a comparatively safer investment option than bitcoin. Additionally, the broader index has shown terrific resilience once it crossed the coveted 4,000 mark back in March. After all, the index is still above the 4000 level and seems set to rise further. The index has also registered strong performance since its March 2020 trough when the coronavirus outbreak hampered economic growth worldwide.Nevertheless, from increase in the pace of vaccination to a plethora of stimulus measures taken by the government to pep up the economy, the S&P 500 index will continue to chug along. Notably, a hawkish Fed and subsequent fears of a rise in inflation has failed to act as a deterrent for the broader index’s upward journey. What’s more, two Fed members recently assured investors that interest rate will remain low at least for now, something that bodes well for the stock market.Therefore, given the positives, we have highlighted five solid stocks from the S&P 500 index that are poised to gain traction in the near term along with the broader index.

2021-06-23T13:07:01.000Z," The cryptocurrency market witnessed a volatile Tuesday after bitcoin briefly fell below $30,000 for the first time since January, this year. The world’s most popular and biggest digital coin (in terms of market cap) eventually recovered to $33,994.56, up 11.3% on a 24-hour basis, per coindesk.com data.The volatility can be attributed to regulatory crackdown by China, which reportedly mines almost 60% of the world’s currently circulating bitcoins. Apart from shutting down bitcoin mining projects in the Sichuan province, banks and fintech organizations have been asked to stop dealing in cryptocurrencies.The China crackdown has rattled cryptocurrency miners. Notably, China’s bitcoin mining company BIT Mining BTCM delivered the first batch consisting of 320 mining machines to Kazakhstan despite Sichuan shutdown. The company is now planning to accelerate overseas development of its mining resources, including clean energy. Notably, BIT has investments in Kazakhstan and Texas.Moreover, the hawkish tone of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is now expected to make its first interest-rate hike in 2023 instead of 2024, spooked the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, concerns over huge power consumption in mining bitcoin have dragged down its prices in recent times.Bitcoin is currently down more than 47% from its all-time high of $64,829.14 hit on Apr 14. Over the past seven days, the digital coin is down more than 15%. Moreover, Ethereum, the second-biggest digital coin (in terms of market cap), is currently down 21.7% in the past week, per CoinGecko data.Bitcoin’s downward spiral is expected to continue and is feared to slip below the $20,000 mark due to lower demand in the near term. Notably, per glassnode’s latest weekly update, both bitcoin and Ethereum witnessed weak on-chain activity with active addresses and total transfer volume falling back to 2020 and early 2021 levels this week.The overall cryptocurrency market collapse has also dragged down crypto-oriented stocks. Since Apr 14, Canaan CAN, Marathon Digital MARA, Riot Blockchain RIOT, Coinbase COIN, SOS Limited SOS and MicroStrategy MSTR are down 41.9%, 36.4%, 35.8%, 32.2%, 31.3% and 24.7%, respectively.Of this list, Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain, both cryptocurrency miners, are stocks to avoid as growing volatility bitcoin prices have direct impact on their businesses. Currently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Apart from bitcoin price volatility, Marathon Digital faces risks related to lack of a power agreement to support the increasing number of miners.

2021-06-23T13:23:54.000Z," The hits keep coming for bitcoin. Most recently, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is piling it on, finding more faults with the biggest cryptocurrency than any redeeming qualities. The BIS stated in its latest Annual Economic Report:“By now, it is clear that cryptocurrencies are speculative assets rather than money…Bitcoin, in particular, has few redeeming public interest attributes when also considering its wasteful energy footprint.”Perhaps they have been listening to Elon Musk, who also has taken aim at bitcoin mining’s energy consumption. Bitcoin is no stranger to criticism or threats. The BIS’ assessment also comes on the heels of China’s cryptocurrency crackdown targeting bitcoin mining. The bitcoin price mostly shrugged off the BIS report, with the price up by a double-digit percentage in the last 24-hour stretch.While the BIS is not a fan of bitcoin, it does not have any problem with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs,) which are catching on globally. CBDCs are digital versions of fiat money, such as the U.S. dollar, that are issued by central banks, potentially using blockchain technology, and can be used as a form of payment by individuals and businesses.China has been an early-mover on the CBDC front and is already integrating the digital yuan into its economy. Governments that feel threatened by bitcoin, including Nigeria and Ghana, have shown their support for CBDCs. According to the BIS, there are nearly six dozen central banks currently exploring the use of CBDCs.The BIS has placed a target on the backs of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and big techs, saying that they “all tend to work against the public good element that underpins the payment system.” Meanwhile, on CBDCs, the BIS’ Benoit Coeure is quoted by Reuters as saying, “The train has left the station.”Despite the regulatory spotlight, bitcoin bulls have been flexing their muscles of late, doubling down and buying the dip. Among them, Cathie Wood, who is at the helm of Ark Invest, has reportedly scooped up 1 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and more than 214,000 shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Using the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF, Wood seemingly allocated USD 12 million to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Wood is not the only one buying. Chun Wang, co-founder of F2Pool, a bitcoin mining pool, is also using the market downdraft to buy more bitcoin. While the bitcoin price may be off its peak, the cryptocurrency community is used to its volatility.This article was originally posted on FX Empire EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Continues to Recover  USD/JPY Price Forecast – US Dollar Testing ¥111 Level  Amazon’s E-Commerce Business Keeps Growing.

2021-06-23T13:58:40.000Z," By Tom Arnold and Karin StroheckerLONDON (Reuters) - El Salvador is determined to push ahead with making bitcoin legal tender, a process that will bring only small risks and prove a ""leap forward for humanity"", the country's President Nayib Bukele said in an interview with a bitcoin journalist.El Salvador this month became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender in a move taking effect in September.Speaking in the interview released on Wednesday, Bukele said the move would boost jobs and economic development to the Central America country.He said he was confident the project would be a success - despite the World Bank declining to offer technical support and concerns expressed by the International Monetary Fund.""It looks bulletproof,"" he said in an hour-long interview with bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack. ""I'm pretty sure this is going to work, not only for us but for humanity, because it is a leap forward for humanity.Bukele said the move would lessen El Salvador's reliance on the U.S. dollar, the existing legal tender.""(We will be) at least becoming a little less dependent on the output of new dollars, and the new inflation that's coming with those all those new dollars,"" he said.There was no plan to hold bitcoin in national reserves, though that might happen ""probably in the future"", he said.The World Bank declined to give assistance to El Salvador's bitcoin implementation given the environmental and transparency drawbacks.""Having the World Bank, advisers or technical support would have been nice, but we really don't need it,"" Bukele said, adding local talent was more than enough.He acknowledged there might be some risks to the push.""But I really do not see them as big risk, only probably getting some people angry at us but they haven't been so nice to us anyway, so you know, why not try something new?""Analyst have voiced concerns that the bitcoin push could endanger the country's request for an $1 billion programme to the IMF. The fund has voiced economic and legal concerns regarding the move, though Bukele said his government had spelled out its plan and would offer more explanation if needed.""We adopted the U.S. dollar in the year 2001, what's the difference?"" he asked.""The only difference, probably, is the reasons why we're doing this. In 2001 it was probably done for the benefit of the banks and this decision is done for the benefit of the people.""Bukele also said he had received a lot of interest from parties over exploiting renewable energy from the country's volcanoes to build a bitcoin mining hub.""We have discovered new (geothermal) wells that will give us 95 megawatts, which is not huge but still quite considerable,"" he said.A bitcoin mining plant would be built at a cost of $480 million, he said, while bitcoin would pay for infrastructure from schools to bridges.(Editing by Alison Williams)Novavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-23T14:18:39.000Z," By Yousef Saba   DUBAI (Reuters) -The Bitcoin Fund debuted on the Nasdaq Dubai on Wednesday, becoming the Middle East's first listed cryptocurrency fund.   The fund, which was listed by Canadian digital asset management firm 3iQ on the Toronto Stock Exchange last year, has roughly $1.5 billion in assets under management and plans to double that next year.   ""With the listing of the Bitcoin Fund, it's going to give people access in the region to this fund on the Dubai exchange in the hours that the Dubai exchange trades at,"" Frederick Pye, the chief executive officer of 3iQ, told Reuters.   ""If the volumes are significant, we'll be looking to raise capital to increase the size of the Bitcoin Fund here in Dubai and we will continue to issue shares based on the demand that comes from the region,"" Pye said in an interview.   The listing will help satisfy demand for investment diversification in the region, as well as environmental, social and governance (ESG) needs, such as for pension funds and family offices, Pye said.   Dalma Capital, a Dubai-based alternative investment firm, was lead arranger for the Nasdaq Dubai listing. Corporate finance advisor 01 Capital and investment firm Razlin Capital, both based in London, advised on the listing and Pinsent Masons was legal counsel for the listing process.   ""Today's secondary listing of existing units from Canada was met with very strong demand, which has validated the need for an additional offering to satisfy the demand from regional investors,"" said Zachary Cefaratti, CEO of Dalma Capital, declining to say when that could be.   Pye acknowledged that China's recent crackdown on mining cryptocurrencies has hit digital currency prices, but he said the timing of that move would help those who bought into the Dubai listing.   ""We're very excited because when we hit an all-time high, our investors and our clients and our friends will have doubled their money,"" Pye added.   (Reporting by Yousef Saba, Jacob Greaves and Abdel Hadi Ramahi; Writing by Yousef Saba; Editing by Alexander Smith and Paul Simao) Novavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-23T14:40:18.000Z," In the middle of the night of June 8, El Salvador passed a new law making bitcoin legal tender – actually, forced tender. The high priest of El Salvador’s bitcoin evangelicals is none other than President Nayib Bukele. One of his favorite sermons is “The Beauty of Bitcoin.” The reverend claims that bitcoin will result in a dramatic reduction in the cost of transmitting remittances to El Salvadorans. If that’s not bad enough, Jack Mallers, one of Bukele’s deacons and the CEO of the mobile-payments app Strike, a company that will apparently be granted a monopoly franchise over El Salvador’s bitcoin remittance scheme, sermonizes that, “If you send $50 to El Salvador, it will cost 25 bucks.” Are these sermons factually based? Steve H. Hanke is a Professor of Applied Economics at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and Founder and Co-Director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise, where Nicholas Hanlon is the Chief of Staff.El Salvador depends heavily on remittances. They make up 21% of El Salvador’s gross domestic product, the second highest of any country in the Western Hemisphere. Traditionally, remittances are sent and received via money-transfer services provided by private companies. According to the World Bank, in the first quarter, these companies (Western Union, MoneyGram, Ria and Remitly) charged between 0%-4% fees for a $200 remittance, depending on the transfer method. Related: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Nudges Up as Regulatory Risks LingerThe greenback is kingAs it turns out, El Salvador benefits from some of the lowest remittance costs in the world. Indeed, it has the sixth-lowest remittance costs of the 104 countries monitored by the World Bank. Not surprisingly, El Salvador’s remittance costs are the lowest of any country in the Latin American-Caribbean region, with the average transaction fee for sending a remittance at 2.85%.What about bitcoin remittances? Well, for one thing, most El Salvadorans are not interested in bitcoin. They don’t want to use it. They prefer the U.S. dollar, which has been El Salvador’s legal tender since 2001, when El Salvador mothballed the colón and put it in a museum. In what has been, in effect, a real-world pilot study of a bitcoin-based economy, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Beach, people don’t use bitcoin for a variety of reasons (according to a Reuters report). Furthermore, 82.5% of more than 1,600 respondents to a survey by El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce said that they don’t want to receive remittances in bitcoin. Also, 93.5% said they don’t want to receive their salaries in bitcoin. In El Salvador, bitcoin is for the birds. The greenback is king.One of the many reasons why El Salvadorans eschew bitcoin is, in fact, the high cost of dealing in bitcoin. At present, if Salvadorans without bank accounts (70% of the population) are sent bitcoin, but want dollars, they must exchange bitcoin for dollars at a bitcoin ATM. Unfortunately for El Salvadorans, there are currently only two bitcoin ATMs in the country, both located in the small, coastal area that has been dubbed “Bitcoin Beach.” Athena, the manufacturer of one of the two bitcoin ATMs in El Salvador, plans to bring more ATMs into the county. But exchanging bitcoin for dollars at an Athena ATM costs a 5% minimum fee. And that 5% is just Athena’s cut – it does not include the “network fee” to execute the transaction, or the travel costs and inconvenience associated with going to an ATM, as well as the security and safety costs associated with using the ATM to obtain those greenbacks that Salvadorans prefer. Related: Why the Current Inflation Wave Could Fizzle OutThe bitcoin evangelicals’ math just doesn’t add up. Remittances sent via traditional money-transfer services have a realized cost of only 2.85%. But, remittances sent via bitcoin will require Salvadorans to cough up much more than 5% to obtain the dollars they want. It’s clear that remittance costs are not the reason that Bukele is preaching from the bitcoin pulpit. We wonder who’s crafting his sermons?Crash de bitcoin versus corrección: ¿cuál es la diferencia?Huobi’s Tighter Derivatives Rules Leave Chinese Traders Scrambling for AlternativesRelated QuotesNovavax CEO says manufacturing issues are reason for delay in EUA filing.Conducted last fall, the EBRI surveyed 2,000 retirees between the ages of 62 and 75 with less than $1 million in retirement assets.

2021-06-23T14:40:18.000Z," Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler remained focused on issuing new regulations related to zero-commission trading platforms rather than the crash in cryptocurrency prices in June, which by late Monday had led to the evaporation of roughly $1.3 trillion in wealth, two public appearances on Wednesday suggest.The U.S. regulator is concerned about zero-commission trading platforms that send retail customer orders to market makers in exchange for so-called payment for order flow, a controversial system that critics say creates a conflict of interest between those brokers and their customers. Though the practice has been around for a while, it has become increasingly widespread after online broker Robinhood began to offer free trading in 2014.Read more: As crypto crash wipes out $1.3 trillion, here’s what some pros advise about buying bitcoin, dogecoin, other assetsThis practice, Gensler said during the London City Week virtual conference Wednesday morning, has lead to roughly 40% of retail stock trades being routed to market makers rather than stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq 
        NDAQ,
        +0.02%.
“Thus, significant trading interest on these platforms is not necessarily being reflected in the commonly cited trading systems, which include dark pools, and by off-exchange wholesalers,” he said, referring to data collected by “lit” exchanges, like the NYSE. With roughly half of all stock orders left out of those calculations, it’s actually difficult to know which prices retail investors are entitled to, he added.A zero commission trade, is “not free. It just simply isn’t,” Gensler said in a   subsequent interview on Bloomberg TV. “It might be zero commission, but underneath that…some of these brokers are then selling your orders to another firm,” he added. “Why is somebody paying for it, is it because there’s an inherent conflict, even if it’s a penny or two or some small fraction, that’s trading off you, the retail public? So, it’s not free.”See also: SEC chairman says Americans need a ‘cop on the beat’ to protect investors from crypto fraudGensler also questioned the usefulness of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), which raise cash through an initial public offering, after which the shell company has two years to use the raised funds to purchase a private company, thereby making that company public. Recent academic research has shown that SPACs are a much more expensive way to take a company public, and that those extra costs are placed on the end retail investor. “These are very expensive, dilutive products,” he told Bloomberg TV. “The sponsor takes out a chunk at the beginning then there’s more to be taken out later when they merge with a private company.” The SEC chairman also focused on his continued push to create a new regulatory disclosure regime that would force public companies to disclose risks posed by climate change.  Such a regime is strongly opposed by Republicans in Congress who say that it’s an attempt coerce public companies into addressing climate change, rather than an honest attempt to inform investors.In a June 14 letter to Chairman Gensler and his predecessor Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, 12 Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee said “We do not believe that any further securities regulations to specifically address global warming are necessary or appropriate, and will only serve to further discourage firms from becoming publicly traded, thus denying significant investment opportunities to retail investors.”On Wednesday, Gensler was resolute in his belief that climate disclosures are important for investors to make informed decisions in the marketplace. “I have deep respect for those senators who wrote that letter,” he told Bloomberg TV.” However, he added,  “Investors want to know more about this very important risk, climate risk, how companies deal with whatever transition might be in the future, whatever physical risks that they have and how are they managing it.”It’s notable that Gensler did not address his thoughts about investor protection with respect to cryptocurrencies, given his past statements on the need for more rules affecting the market for digital assets, as well asthe recent volatility in the market for digital assets.In a before the House Appropriations Committee in May, Gensler said there were “gaps” in regulation of cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin 
        BTCUSD,
        +2.90%
       and ether 
        ETHUSD,
        +2.41%,
       noting that there are “thousands” of them extant, many of which are operating as securities. “We’ve only been able to bring 75 actions and there are others currently that are not compliant.”See also: SEC chairman says Americans need a ‘cop on the beat’ to protect investors from crypto fraudGensler added that he would like to work with Congress “to bring investor protection to the platforms, where these sometimes-commodities, sometimes-securities are trading on the platform.”He gave the example of the practice of front running, whereby an exchange could share order information so that another investor can trade ahead of a crypto transaction, making other investors’ purchase or sale more expensive, noting that “Without a cop with a beat and some rules of the road, then market participants can front run your orders.”White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday addressed Tesla undefined CEO Elon Musk's tweet that it was ""odd"" his company wasn't invited to a White House event later in the day tied to the Biden administration's moves on electric vehicles. ""Today it's the three largest employers of the United Auto Workers and the UAW president who will stand with President Biden,"" Psaki told reporters, though she added that the administration looks forward to having a range of partners. Musk has faced a legal fight following a tweet discouraging union organizing."

As the crypto community awaits the supposedly bullish London hard fork on the Ethereum blockchain, some analysts are taking a cautious stance on ether and foresee little price reaction after the upgrade. “I don’t expect much action in any direction,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger said. “The upgrade itself is overrated, and what matters is what happens after.”Ether is the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, which is scheduled to undergo a hard fork, or backward-incompatible upgrade, called “London,” on Thursday. The change will implement four proposals, including the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 that will activate a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid to miners. Once the upgrade takes effect, it is expected to bring a deflationary asset appeal to ether, possibly drawing more investment demand for the cryptocurrency. That’s the popular narrative in the crypto community. “Deflationary ETH upgrade EIP-1559 scheduled. Today’s dip is a blessing,” Simon Dedic, managing partner at Moonrock Capital, tweeted on Tuesday.However, while the upgrade will introduce a burn mechanism, the amount of ether destroyed will depend on the actual network usage. In other words, EIP-1559 does not directly influence ether’s supply. In that sense, the bullish narrative appears overdone for now, Kruger said. Matthew Dibb, chief operations officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said these types of changes are similar to bitcoin halvings and take time to exert an effect. “Long-term, we believe that ether will see significant price appreciation as a result of this upgrade,” Dibb said. “However, we aren’t expecting an immediate move in either direction.” Bitcoin halving refers to a programmed code that reduces the per-block issuance of the cryptocurrency by half every four years. Halving makes bitcoin’s monetary policy predictable. The EIP upgrade does the exact opposite.“It is difficult, however, to predict exactly how much ether will be burnt over time given that the base fee dynamically adjusts according to network activity and demand for block space,” CoinDesk’s Christine Kim noted. Another source of uncertainty is the impact of EIP-1559 on miner economics and how the community will respond after the upgrade. According to Compass Mining, miners will see their revenue dip by 20% to 30% after the upgrade because part of their fees will be burnt. All these things will become apparent over time. Thus, traders may sit on the fence in the short-term – more so as the popular bullish narrative appears to have been priced in, according to Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange. The price of ether doubled to $4,000 in the four weeks to mid-May, decoupling from the then rangebound bitcoin mainly on the back of the belief that the EIP upgrade would reduce ether’s supply.  The cryptocurrency charted a record 12-day winning trend from July 21 to Aug. 2, gaining nearly 50%. “The upcoming upgrade could be a nonevent,” Balani said. “The cryptocurrency remains dependent on bitcoin in terms of price action in the short-term.” The options market seems to agree with Balani. Ether’s one-month implied volatility continues its sideways churn, a sign investors don’t expect big moves over the next four weeks.  “The combination of the market running up into technical resistance at a time when the event is happening could indeed translate to a sell-the-fact reaction,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said. However, setbacks, if any, are likely to be well supported down into the $2,000 area, he said. Ether is currently trading near $2,500, having reached two-month highs above $2,650 on Sunday, CoinDesk 20 data show. The cryptocurrency has declined by 0.12% in the past 24 hours, while bitcoin has lost 1.3%. Balani foresees ether rallying to $3,000 if bitcoin manages to secure a foothold above the long-held resistance of $40,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is priced at about $38,250 at press time. Also read: Market Wrap: Bitcoin in Pullback Mode as Regulatory Concerns Rise Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Ongoing regulatory concerns in the U.S. and China have kept some bitcoin buyers on the sidelines, with lower support seen around $34,000 to $36,000. “We expect the pullback to mature in one to two weeks near the 50-day moving average around $34K, after which bitcoin is likely to clear $42.6K for a revised upside target near $51K,” wrote Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, in a Monday newsletter.Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has broken out of a two-month consolidation relative to bitcoin. The ETH/BTC ratio faces initial resistance near 0.07, and a decisive break above that level could yield further upside towards 0.08.ETH could find support around $2,300 to $2,400. “If ETH successfully holds above support, we expect upward momentum from the current move toward a proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 to push for a retest of the all-time high (around $4K),” wrote QCP Capital in a Telegram chat. Some ether bulls are also enthused about the Ethereum blockchain’s upcoming London hard fork, an upgrade expected later this week that’s expected to reduce the network’s net issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency.  “We are less optimistic about BTC and we think that upside on BTC might be capped in the near term,” QCP wrote.“Last week’s short squeeze led a large contango to open in the futures market, but as bitcoin failed to break out from its range the contango has declined in recent days,” wrote Arcane Research in a Tuesday newsletter.Contango is a term used to describe bullish arbitrage, which occurs when the bitcoin futures price is higher than the spot price. Since April, bitcoin’s contango has narrowed as bullish sentiment waned.“The CME contango remains substantially below the unregulated exchanges, suggesting that the institutional investors remain more cautious than the crypto native traders,” Arcane wrote.The growing contango could also suggest an accumulation of leveraged long positions, albeit slightly lower over the past week. “Be wary of potential long squeezes if bitcoin fails to find support above $37,000,” Arcane wrote.A significant amount of bitcoin has flowed out of exchanges over the past week, which could indicate investors’ preference to hold rather than sell positions. “The exchange net position change metric maps out the monthly rate of coins flowing in (green) or out (red) of all exchanges,” wrote Glassnode in a Monday newsletter. “This week we have seen an extremely large volume of coins flow out of exchanges, comparable to the peak outflows seen in November 2020.”The amount of the stablecoin gemini dollar (GUSD) on exchanges has seen a sharp decline recently, which may imply an ongoing rise in bitcoin’s price, according to a chart by Mignolet on CryptoQuant. In 2018, when the downward trend of bitcoin price was reversed, GUSD saw a drop in its amount. Meanwhile, the combined market cap of the largest two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, is approaching $90 billion, while the market cap of USDC increased sixfold since the beginning of the year, according to Skew, a data provider. The tether stablecoin’s daily usage on Ethereum has shifted slightly later in the day from Asian business hours toward European and U.S. market hours, possibly a result of China’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and USDT users’ migration to other blockchains from Ethereum, a new report suggests. In 2020, most USDT activity on Ethereum happened between 2:00 and 14:00 coordinated universal time, while the period from 6:00 to 8:00 UTC was the busiest, according to the report by blockchain-analysis firm Coin Metrics. However, in 2021, there has been less usage during 2:00 and 6:00 UTC, and more during 15:00 to 20:00 UTC.Investors can trade crypto 24 hours, seven days a week but local stock exchange times can be used as a proxy for when traders in any given region are active. The trading hours of the Hong Kong stock exchange, London Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange are 1:30 to 8:00 UTC, 8:00 to 16:30 UTC and 14:30 to 21:00 UTC, respectively.  Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended lower on Tuesday.  Notable winners of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):cardano (ADA) +3.9%chainlink (LINK) +0.79%Notable losers:uniswap (UNI) -6.4%polkadot (DOT) -5.21%tezos (XTZ) -4.39%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher on Monday as bullish sentiment continues into August. Bitcoin underperformed other major cryptocurrencies and is down about 3% over the past 24 hours compared to a 2% rise in ether over the same period. Buyers remain active despite ongoing regulatory crackdowns in China. On Sunday, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) said it will keep applying high regulatory pressure on crypto trading, mostly due to concerns about financial risk. Traders are also digesting the 58-page “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, proposed by Rep. Don Beyer’s (D-Va.), seeking to create an exhaustive regulatory regime for digital assets. The U.S. Senate is also advancing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill with a crypto tax provision, which could be a source of market anxiety. For now, a breakdown on intraday charts “suggests that bitcoin may fall back to the mid-range at around $36,000, or lower, before the rally continues,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDeskCryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Over the past month, popular “meme stocks” have sold off as bitcoin rallied. This inverse relationship was noted in The Daily Shot newsletter a few months ago, and indicates a pattern of buying and selling across high yielding traditional and crypto markets. It is possible that traders will flock to meme stocks if bitcoin pulls back from overbought levels. The bitcoin options market has been heavily skewed towards call buying over the past month, which could signal the return of bullish sentiment. “Now that the large spot price sell-off already occurred in May, there aren’t as many gains to be protected via put buying,” wrote Gregoire Magadini, co-founder and CEO of Genesis Volatility, in a Telegram chat. “Combine the lower spot prices with lingering high-ish implied volatility, and bitcoin puts start to look very unattractive,” Magadini wrote. “It makes more sense to buy the dip with call structures than to position oneself using puts.”The chart below shows the bitcoin put/call ratio at the lowest level since January, which preceded a brief 25% pullback in the bitcoin spot price. Digital-asset investment products had their fourth straight week of net outflows, even as cryptocurrency markets staged their biggest rally since early this year. Net outflows across all digital-asset funds totaled $19.5 million, according to a report Monday by CoinShares.Bitcoin-focused funds had outflows totaling $19.7 million, partly offset by net inflows to funds focused on other categories, including multi-asset funds, wrote CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma.Cryptocurrencies rebounded in July after a sluggish May and June. AAVE, an open-source and non-custodial protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, outperformed major crypto currencies with a 33% gain in July. Bitcoin was not far behind with a 20% gain compared to a 12% gain in ether.Ether looks to extend its record daily winning streak in the run-up to a planned upgrade on Ethereum’s blockchain that could significantly reduce the cryptocurrency’s supply growth.Aside from bitcoin’s price recovery from $30,000, ether may have received a boost from Ethereum’s upcoming 11th backward-incompatible upgrade, or hard fork, slated to happen on Aug. 4, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The so-called London hard fork contains four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), of which EIP-1559 will activate a mechanism that would burn a portion of fees paid to miners. Once it takes effect, increased network usage will result in a higher amount of ETH being burned, thereby curbing the cryptocurrency’s supply growth over time.Meanwhile, 27 of 40, or 68%, of crypto experts surveyed by Finder believe that ether will one day overtake bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap; 58% of the panelists believe that the “flippening” could happen within the next five years. The price of ether is expected to reach $4,596 per ETH by the end of this year, according to the average forecast from 27 experts on Finder’s panel who gave their price predictions. Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended lower on Monday. Notable winners of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):tezos (XTZ) +3.1%chainlink (LINK) +0.59%Notable losers:polkadot (DOT) -6.91%the graph (GRT) -6.04%stellar (XLM) -5.24%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A decline on BTC’s balance on exchanges and increased BTC balances of holders across their wallet addresses indicate that some of the coins were sold to buyers off the exchanges.“The largest of the whales may be exchanges that were previously thought of as distinct separate entities, when now we discover in effect they were exchanges all along,” Woo said. “‘Shrimps (bitcoin holders with less than one BTC) to smaller whales all increased their holdings … These guys are unlikely to be exchanges, so it validates most of the coins that left exchanges are real.” As data from Glassnode shows, in the past two weeks, the total circulating supply held by entities with different amounts of BTC all increased, with the exception of entities with balances between 100 and 1,000 BTC, and those with balances of more than 100,000 BTC.“When I see big outflows like this, I think that traders ‘like the price’ and are willing to hold over a longer time period,” George Kaloudis, research associate at CoinDesk, said. “It certainly shows that investors are more willing to weather the storm in the near-term given the friction of moving funds back on exchanges to liquidate.”The outflows of bitcoin balance on exchanges, based on analysis by Chainalysis, is also a case-by-case situation, an indication that some investors and traders may have changed their preferred platforms for trading and other crypto activities.As the chart below shows, the drop in the number of bitcoin held on crypto-to-crypto exchanges was much steeper than the drop in bitcoin balances on crypto-to-fiat exchanges since May 1.“I think much of the bitcoin that has been withdrawn is moving exchanges, as people change which exchanges they trade on,” Gradwell said.Even though it is not clear what has triggered the change of preferred crypto exchanges by traders and investors, Binance, the most popular crypto exchange by trading volume, has faced tougher regulatory actions in countries around the world. Bitcoin’s recent outflows from exchanges “was presumably catalyzed by Binance’s announcement of dramatically lower withdrawal limits for non-KYC (know-your-customer) customers,” blockchain research firm Delphi Digital wrote in its daily market update on July 29, which also noted that Binance and Coinbase were the top two exchanges in terms of absolute outflows.Binance also said that its users in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands won’t be able to open new futures and derivative positions on the platform.On the other hand, the shift in preference for crypto-to-fiat exchanges also could signal that new investors in crypto are more comfortable with bitcoin investments only, according to CoinDesk’s Kaloudis.“We are seeing new entrants to the bitcoin market who are presumably less comfortable trading across cryptos in general, [which is] theoretically more bullish for bitcoin adoption,” he said.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The rally came to an end later in the evening and has fallen 5.5% over the last 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows.The bill, which is being debated in the Senate, seeks to bolster tax receipts in order to fund the more than $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements across the country, $28 billion of which would come by way of crypto transactions.Criticism over the bill’s definitions as it relates to the crypto community has been vocal with some suggesting the bill is too broad and could apply to most economic activity in the U.S. crypto industry.An updated version of the Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, revealed Sunday evening, seeks to narrow the definition of “broker” to people who provide digital asset transfers. The bill’s revised language does not explicitly include decentralized exchanges, nor does it explicitly exclude miners, node operators, software developers, or similar parties.The options market, however, is painting a somewhat different picture. Bitcoin has been rallying into “the largest open interest strike” of the July expiry, Coinbase announced in a newsletter.“Listed options are seeing continued interest to buy weekly low premium upside calls between $40K and $50K strikes,” the exchange operator wrote.Other notable cryptos in the top 20 by market capitalization also fell with XRP, link and theta shedding the largest amount, between 5%-7% over a 24-hour period.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The bitcoin price was holding above $41,000, the highest since May, after a 10-day winning streak that was the longest in eight years for the largest cryptocurrency. As of press time bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands at $41,344, up 6.2% over the past 24 hours. Other CoinDesk 20 digital assets were also in the green, with ether rising 4.5% to $2,453 and chainlink jumping 13% to $21.72.   Although the bitcoin price slipped after 0:00 coordinated universal time (UTC) on Saturday, it had notched 10 consecutive daily increases from July 21 through Friday, the longest winning streak since 2013. Bitcoin reached an all-time high near $65,000 in mid-April as market euphoria peaked and the U.S. exchange Coinbase went public through a direct stock listing. But the price tumbled over the next few months as China cracked down on cryptocurrency mining and exchanges and regulators around the world moved to tighten industry rules. The Federal Reserve began to consider tapering its $120 billion-a-month of asset purchases – a form of extreme monetary stimulus that has been a big driver of the investment narrative that bitcoin could serve as an effective hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Retail investors who had piled into bitcoin as prices soared early in the year rushed to exit positions, while big institutional investors grew reluctant to enter the market at lofty valuations. Prices traded in a range between $30,000 and $40,000 for about two months. But after bitcoin briefly dipped below $30,000 on July 20, the cryptocurrency began a steady ascent that has put it on track for an 18% gain in July, the first monthly increase in three months. “The incredible winning streak comes at a very strange time when the FUD is thick,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Friday in a newsletter. FUD is an acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt,” a term often used by crypto traders and analysts to refer to any negative news.    Bitcoin price resistance is still seen as stiff in the low-$40,000 range: “BTC is potentially rangebound until it breaks and closes above $42,000,” according to the digital-asset firm Eqonex. “Trendline support has moved up to $38,200, with $36,500 the next support.”But some industry analysts are now wondering aloud if the worst of bitcoin’s recent bear market might have passed. “Something feels different this week,” Coinbase wrote Saturday in a market analysis. “Max fear seems to have disappeared.”On a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is up 43%, vastly outperforming the 17% year-to-date gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

After spending most of the day in negative territory, cryptocurrencies made a late surge on Friday with bitcoin hitting its highest level since mid-May. Bitcoin is currently trading above $41,000 at press time and is up more than 15% over the past week. Bullish sentiment has returned after a sharp sell-off in May and two months of consolidation above the $30,000 support level.Some analysts are optimistic and expect buyers to remain active above the 50-day moving average, which is above $34,000 now.Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:“We have been talking about the market having lower liquidity during the summer for a few weeks now and we think this helps explain the sharp price action we saw that triggered the short squeeze of nearly $1 billion in futures liquidations,” David Grider, a strategist at FundStrat, wrote in a Thursday newsletter.Grider stated that bitcoin’s spike could reflect a flight to safety from Chinese investors looking to “get out at any cost,” given the recent sell-off in Asian equities. “Bitcoin could have been trading as a proxy tool for investors looking for a hedge,” Grider wrote.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets this week that the U.S. central bank is considering when to start winding down its program of purchasing  $120 billion in bonds every month, but Wall Street analysts are already wondering what will come after that.According to Bank of America, the Fed may not get around to raising interest rates anywhere close to the levels that were considered normal historically, anytime soon. That implies that monetary policy could stay loose for years, even after the Fed stops actively printing money to pay for the purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The dynamic might be bullish for bitcoin, because many investors see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the inflation and dollar debasement that might come from easy-money policies. A similar shallow tightening pattern was seen toward the end of 2018, when the Fed pushed the benchmark interest rate up to around 2.5%, traditional financial markets went into a swoon, and by early 2019, the central bank had reversed course and started cutting rates again. According to the Bank of America analysts, bond market investors may already be anticipating the dynamic, which may explain why 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are at historically low levels of around 1.2%, well below the most-recent annual inflation rate of 5.4%“We think the level of rates in the U.S. reflects a market expectation that the Fed will produce only a shallow hiking cycle,” the analysts wrote.The active entities of bitcoin have surged over the last week, rising 30% to 325,000 active entities per day, according to Glassnode. The number has been in decline from January to mid-July. Entities refer to “a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity and are estimated through advanced heuristics and Glassnode’s proprietary clustering algorithms,” according to Glassnode. Active entities include those active either as a sender or receiver.Ether, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, faces resistance near $2,500, where resistance is defined by the 100-day moving average. Ether is up about 10% over the past week and rallied nearly 30% after holding support at $1,720 on July 20. Lower support is seen at $2,000, which could stabilize a pullback.Ether is consolidating relative to bitcoin and is on traders’ watch for a potential breakout. The ETH/BTC ratio has initial support at 0.054, which must hold in order to keep ETH’s relative uptrend intact.Flow soars: Flow, a token powering a blockchain network focused on non-fungible tokens (NFT), surged in price after the big cryptocurrency exchange Binance said Friday it would list the project. Binance said at 7:00 UTC (3 a.m. ET) that it would list the FLOW token; since then, the price has rallied 61% to $29 from $18. On a 24-hour basis, the cryptocurrency is up 30%.Framework to Regulate Crypto, Stablecoins: Legislation before Congress to provide a “comprehensive legal framework” to regulate the digital asset market and possibly grant the federal government the ability to ban some stablecoins was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday. According to sponsor Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), chairman of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee, the existing digital asset market structure and regulatory framework are too “ambiguous and dangerous for investors and consumers.”Six Dapps to Go Live on SKALE: Ethereum scaling project Skale has announced which decentralized applications (dapps) will first go live on its network.

The cryptocurrency is up about 23% over the past week, a gain driven by improving sentiment and short covering. Some analysts expect bitcoin to remain range-bound as the current rally takes a breather. “Our sense is that the market will keep looking to trade within this $30K-$40K range in the near term,” wrote QCP Capital in a Telegram chat. “Into Friday’s month-end expiry, we expect $40K-$42K to hold as the open interest peaks here.”Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:“Price levels to consider are the $40,000 psychological price level, and $44,000, which is the next resistance level BTC saw when Tesla announced they would accept BTC as payment back in February,” Jeffrey Wang, head of Americas at Amber Group, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.In the bitcoin options market, “there is not much open interest between the $45,000 and $50,000 strikes for the August expiry,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We can see sharp moves here.”Bitcoin is up about 35% year to date, double the S&P 500’s 17% gain over the same period. Both bitcoin and stocks are beating gold’s 5% loss year to date.“Bitcoin open interest has also been picking up, breaking above its June highs and retesting support,” Stack Funds, a Singapore-based crypto asset management firm, wrote in a newsletter Thursday. (See chart below.)   “Our expectations for a retest towards the mid/low $20K region is less likely,” Stack Funds wrote. The firm mentioned that a clear breakout in open interest is required in order to signal further upside in bitcoin.Although bitcoin remains in a secular bull market, the cryptocurrency has fallen by a minimum of 25% once in every calendar year since 2013, according to Panxora, a crypto investment firm.“Often that fall averages more than 40% and this kind of drawdown makes cryptocurrency a challenging investment for those that have no way to manage this kind of volatility risk,” Panxora wrote on its website.When managing risk, crypto investors can consider macro conditions such as economic growth and inflation, which tend to influence the prices of assets in both traditional and crypto markets.“I think inflation fears will reemerge,” Gavin Smith, CEO of Panxora, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “And I think that will be the catalyst for a true move in the cryptocurrency, certainly bitcoin’s over the next six to nine months.“From a longer-term perspective, I’m quite bullish on the environment, because what we’ve seen in the downturn is really people pulling away from the inflation narrative that we saw,” Smith said. “Personally, I think it’s too early to pull away from that.”Smith said that Panxora and other institutions he spoke to are “entering the buy zone.” “Even if they’re long-term bullish on bitcoin, what they do is they wait for these frequent sell-offs,” Smith said. “And then they use that to start accumulating their holdings, rather than chasing the market higher.”Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended up higher on Thursday. Notable winners of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):the graph (GRT) +5.05%bitcoin cash (BCH) +4.38%polkadot (DOT) +4.12%Notable losers:chainlink (LINK) -2.33%eos (EOS) -1.71%algorand (ALGO) -1.01%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has a price floor now of around $37,300, Chainalysis wrote Thursday in its latest market report. The blockchain data firm wrote that the market is holding the price floor well as demand from existing whale investors (large bitcoin holders) has returned.“So demand is returning to the market,” the report concluded. “Supply, which has become more liquid since prices fell in May, is only as liquid as it was in December 2020. This all suggests the market is at least in a sideways state and is unlikely to enter an extreme price fall phase.”Chainalysis estimates a temporary bitcoin price floor by calculating the average cost of bitcoin held by investors who entered the market in the past 12 months. Getting the data is possible because of blockchain’s transparency.At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at 39,667.50, down 2.13% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.Unlike the case in traditional markets, bitcoin’s price gains and losses have been concentrated in a short period of time, Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, wrote in the report. Data shows that since last year, 75% of bitcoin’s absolute price gains occurred in just 25% of the days when its price closed in green. A similar trend also occurs for bitcoin’s absolute losses.That differs from traditional markets such as the S&P 500, where gains or losses are more equally distributed. For example, a little more than 75% of the S&P 500’s gains took place in more than 50% of the days.Therefore, according to Gradwell, the so-called on-chain price floor is an essential metric for crypto traders and analysts to understand bitcoin’s market, which can be become extremely volatile in a short period of time.“If an investor buys bitcoin at $40,000 and continues to hold, then we know that they value bitcoin at least at $40,000,” Gradwell wrote. “If the price were to go below $40,000, then it would be below their valuation and they may buy more.”The chart below also shows that the on-chain price floor is a better indicator than the 200- and 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the price to hint when a bull run may end.Crypto traders and analysts have long been watching the “death cross” – the intersection of the 50-day moving average below the 200-day moving average – as a key technical indicator of a shift from a bull market to a bearish one.But during the bull runs in late 2017 and this April, for example, the on-chain price floor flattened both times ahead of the appearance of a “death cross,” making it a “leading” indicator of a change in market trends.“The on-chain price floor stops increasing the moment that investors stop buying in a price rally,” the report said, showing that a decline in bitcoin demand would soon lead to a bearish market trend.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cryptocurrency was trading at $30,000 as recently as July 21 and has been climbing since.If it ends the day in the green, bitcoin would have its longest winning streak since October 2015. But as of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was down slightly since 0:00 coordinated universal time on Thursday, slipping back to below $40,000. “After this eight-day rally, bitcoin may well need to reset as there is a bearish divergence appearing on the short-term frame,” said Laurent Kssis, managing director of exchange-traded products at 21Shares AG. On bitcoin’s daily chart, price action is playing out as the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders top formation in a $28,000 to $42,000 range, said Imran Yusof, a technical analyst at Quantum Economics. Yusof noted that head-and-shoulders top formations are typically bearish.“This range matches the same range in the left shoulder period from Christmas 2020 to early February, also on the daily chart,” he added. In order for the bitcoin rally to continue, “more interest is needed from corporate America,” said Edward Moya, a senior analyst at Oanda, an online broker. He believes that acceptance of bitcoin as a means of payment and more firm commitments from institutional investors will further the rally. The steady rise in bitcoin is a “clear sign that institutional investors are gradually scaling into their longer-term positions,” Moya said.Moya said planned cuts in the maximum allowed leverage on bitcoin derivatives trades on the Binance and FTX cryptocurrency exchanges might help to damp price volatility, which could help to draw in new investors who were leery of the elevated risk.   The cuts in the leverage limits  “should be very supportive for bitcoin‘s longer-term outlook,” Moya said. “The significance of eight straight days of gains is outweighed by the significance of the aforementioned range, i.e. the will of bitcoin bears pressuring above the $42K resistance versus the will of bitcoin bulls supporting below $28K,” Yusof said.“If bitcoin can come down and hold above $35K, there’s a better chance that renewed bullish sentiment alone can drive it through $42K later,” he added. Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Sentiment has significantly improved over the past week, although some analysts think it’s time for a pause before another leg higher.“BTC easily broke through $35K, but I think it will probably have a harder time going through $40K this time,” Justin Chuh, a senior trader at Wave Financial, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.“Miners & sellers are coming in to cash out once more and buyers unable to push it higher after absorbing that hit,” Chuh wrote.Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Sentiment can easily shift from bullish to bearish as bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase with strong overhead resistance.“BTC was already rejected again by its 200-day moving average, just like in early June, but it should try again after a breather, and hopefully not crawling lower than $35K,” Chuh wrote. “If (and when) bitcoin does cross the 200-day, this will signal confidence in the market and demonstrate to many players that the bulls have regained control of the market,” Alexandra Clark, a trader at U.K.-based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.For now, trading activity is sharply higher compared with June. Short-dated call options were actively traded Wednesday morning as bitcoin approached $40,000, according to data from Skew.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares have narrowed their discount relative to the underlying cryptocurrency held in the fund – possibly a sign that buyers are using the vehicle to bet on the recent recovery rally in digital-asset markets.The GBTC shares traded at a discount of 6.6% to net asset value (NAV) on Tuesday, the smallest margin since June 22, based on data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The discount had widened to 15% in mid-June. Some investors may have snapped up GBTC shares in hopes that the discount will evaporate with a bull revival in bitcoin. In that scenario, the buyers would reap any price gains on bitcoin while pocketing extra profit from a narrowing of the discount. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)The ether market grew three times faster than the bitcoin market did in the first six months of the year as large investors diversified into the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, according to crypto exchange Coinbase’s half-yearly review published on Monday.Crypto investors have just endured one of the toughest quarters on record. Despite a recent rebound, fears of overregulation, a clampdown on mining in China and environmental concerns have all contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Most CoinDesk 20 assets, which constitute about 99% of the crypto market by verifiable volume, finished the second quarter with negative returns. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) fell 40%, its third-worst quarter ever. Conversely, the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX) ended the quarter up 18.7%. While bitcoin has recovered some of its losses, the level of optimism is far from what it was at the start of the second quarter.Some crypto CEOs, however, still expect a six-figure bitcoin price, saying that the medium-term outlook for the crypto market is positive, even if sentiment is not, CoinDesk’s Will Canny reports. Stablecoins have existed for roughly seven years, but talk about them has never been as heated as in recent weeks, not only within the crypto community but also among regulators and traditional market investors. Much has been going on the world of stablecoins recently, and some of it can be overwhelming.

Despite a recent rebound, fears of overregulation, a clampdown on mining in China and environmental concerns have all contributed to negative sentiment in the sector.Most CoinDesk 20 assets, which constitute about 99% of the crypto market by verifiable volume, finished the second quarter with negative returns. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) fell 40.4%, its third worst quarter in terms of performance since its inception. Conversely, the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX) ended the quarter up 18.7%. While bitcoin has recovered some of its losses, trading at around $40,500 at press time, the level of optimism is far from what it was at the start of the second quarter.There may be reasons, however, to expect more positive news ahead. CoinDesk spoke to several industry figures and asked them what they thought about the outlook for crypto markets given some of these recent headwinds.Here is what they said:What we’re starting to see is the inevitable, and necessary, meeting of global regulators with industry players. This will only continue as investor interest builds, which is happening fast. The incumbents need to show that they're being responsible and prioritizing consumer protections, and so do we.Yes, there have been price fluctuations, but without doubt, I'm still bullish on bitcoin. Bitcoin has proved its position as a store of value, and this will only be entrenched by Millennial and Gen Z investors. It’s scarcity, durability and security means that, by both fiat and cryptocurrency standards, it has long-term utility and value. A few years ago Bitcoin was compared to the internet in the early ‘90s. This comparison still stands; the internet became ubiquitous and Bitcoin will too.Engaging with regulation doesn’t preclude innovation or disruption. In fact, this will enable the industry to grow. An increase in security and transparency goes hand in hand with an increase in investor confidence – both institutional and retail. We’re seeing investors seek out this assurance more and more. Ultimately, the added scrutiny we’ve seen in recent months is good for crypto.We remain bullish for the remainder of the year. The mining crackdown in China has impacted the price heavily as miners migrate and hash power has dropped, but longer term, this is bullish and will make Bitcoin more resilient. We are still forecasting BTC to be around $175,000 at the peak of the current cycle into 2022.The regulatory scrutiny of the industry at present will also lead to longer-term frameworks being put in place and regulatory-focused players like ourselves providing on ramps for institutions. Our road map for the rest of the year is focused on derivative product rollout, a core requirement for the majority of institutions that will lead to reduced volatility and even further adoption.After a period of trading in range, I believe that bitcoin and crypto will increase substantially by year end. My price prediction is that bitcoin will approach $100,000 by Dec. 31, 2021. The continued adoption of cryptocurrency will continue to accelerate through the year.I don't get worried about short-term fluctuations in the bitcoin price. As a company, we’re thinking longer term – in quarters and years, not days and weeks. If you look back and consider the trends we’ve seen over the last six to 12 months, and especially over the last five to 10 years, the digital-asset ecosystem is clearly moving in one direction. We believe it's still early days, and the digital-asset ecosystem will continue to disrupt traditional players and is the future of money and finance. The narrative over the last six to 12 months has been of large-scale institutions adopting positions in cryptocurrencies, and while we have seen companies such as MicroStrategy, PayPal and Tesla do so, there will be many more to come.I think it is easy to forget that large institutions are like aircraft carriers, and to change their direction takes a huge amount of effort, and most importantly, a significant amount of time. We believe that these adjustments are underway, and the industry will feel the full effect of these changes in the coming months and years.China’s clampdown on mining has been priced in and the road ahead is bright. It opens up the market for other geographies to flourish. Miners will move to regulatory environments that are more favorable to crypto with less competition from a historically dominant China. On the regulatory side itself, things look better than ever, at least in Europe. The ability for crypto companies to passport their registrations once MiCA is introduced will accelerate competitiveness and adoption.

Though a patched version of Geth software has since been released for London, some users, developers and mining pools are calling for further testing of the upgrade, which is scheduled to go live next week.This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.As Ethereum prepares for the activation of its 11th backward-incompatible upgrade, also called a “hard fork,” on Wednesday, Aug. 4, some developers are concerned that the upgrade could use more testing before deployment. Shortly following the biweekly Ethereum core developers meeting on Friday, July 23, Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko wrote in the All Core Developers Discord chatroom, “A couple people have reached out or tweeted about not necessarily being happy with not delaying [the hard fork] … I asked about this [in the meeting] and no one seemed to have a strong opinion, but some folks mentioned this maybe wasn’t the right approach.”  In response to Beiko’s comment, Ethereum software client developer Alexey Akhunov said he agreed it was “strange” there wasn’t more discussion in the biweekly meeting about potentially delaying the hard fork, dubbed “London,” in light of recent events. “I suppose I know why,” wrote Akhunov. “Delaying [London] is a sensitive topic and no one wants to take the heat, understandable.” Others in the chatroom chimed in imploring Ethereum developers to give serious consideration to delaying London a few more weeks for further testing. Concerns over the risks of the London upgrade – which includes a controversial code change impacting the fee market of Ethereum known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 – grew after a bug was discovered in Ethereum software client Geth. For background, Geth is the most popular software used to connect to Ethereum. According to Ethernodes.org, an estimated 86% of all computers, also called nodes, synced to the Ethereum network run Geth client software. On Wednesday, July 21, the Ethereum test network Ropsten, which activated the London hard fork a month ago, suddenly experienced a chain split after an invalid transaction was mined into a block by nodes running Geth while being rejected by nodes running minority clients Besu and Open Ethereum. Within a few hours, a hot fix was released by the Geth team and all users were encouraged to update their software to the latest version number, Terra Nova 1.10.6. While no developers argued that the bug should delay main network activation of London during Friday’s call, some developers did discuss the appropriate course of action if such a bug were discovered on Ethereum rather than on a test network. “What would we do if something like this happened on mainnet, especially in a spot where say Geth, the majority client, they’re producing blocks? It obviously takes several hours to have a fix out,” said Beiko during the meeting.Ethereum Foundation’s Martin Holst Swende stressed that these bugs are not unprecedented occurrences on Ropsten, and while they’re “a pain in the ass” to resolve, there are two ways to address them. First, if a user’s node is following the wrong version of the blockchain, the user will need to internally “rewind the chain” back to the block before the chain split and sync to the new chain using patched Geth software. Second, if a user’s node isn’t already synced to a version of the blockchain but is trying to connect to the network to gather data about recent transactions or execute transactions, the user may end up connecting to the wrong version of the chain. To avoid this, these users will need to “whitelist” certain nodes on Ethereum that are following the correct chain and isolate from others that are stuck on the wrong chain. Both rewinding and whitelisting Ethereum nodes can be done through Geth. Miners on Ropsten were able to resolve the chain split that took place last Wednesday using these tactics, though one miner noted during Friday’s meeting that instructions for repairing chain splits were not effectively communicated before Wednesday’s incident and accordingly left many miners confused as to how to restart their nodes correctly. User “AlexSSD7” wrote in the Discord chatroom that as the representative of an Ethereum mining pool, they were “worried” about the bug in Geth, noting, “A single minute [of network] downtime costs us a lot. One hour of downtime is $20,000 to us.” Unexpected bugs in client software would indeed be disruptive to exchanges and businesses operating on the main network, which is why developers stressed the need for a robust monitoring system that could quickly alert node operators of chain splits and encourage them to pause operations until further investigation. “This seems like a pretty low-hanging fruit that provides a tone of value to the ecosystem. If you’re not sure how to get started, just ask in the Discord,” said Beiko in Friday’s meeting. While these solutions would certainly be helpful if a bug similar to what occurred on Wednesday were to happen again after deployment of London on mainnet, they wouldn’t necessarily be the same solutions used to address larger-scale issues, such as the event of a hacker magically printing 100 million ETH. In the event of something so catastrophic, Ethereum Foundation’s Danny Ryan said in Friday’s meeting that it would be difficult to know in advance how developers would proceed. “I think there are just many options for the many types of bugs and many types of peculiarities that will emerge,” said Ryan. The more severe the impacts of a network bug are, the more intrusive the solution to resolving the bug will likely be – and the more damaging to Ethereum’s reputation as a secure blockchain. With increasingly ambitious hard forks in the near-term horizon on Ethereum’s development roadmap, figuring out potential solutions to a worst-case scenario and plans for damage control with network stakeholders may soon become an imperative for developers to consider. The following is a special edition of Validated Takes highlighting a handful of panel discussions and keynote presentations from last week’s Ethereum community conference in Paris, France. For the full conference agenda, check out the official EthCC website. “DeFi for Traditional Markets: When Security Tokens,” Talk by Fountain co-founder Mathieu Chanson. Highlights: Fountain is a decentralized exchange on Ethereum that enables users to buy and sell security tokens. Chanson highlighted the liquidity and accessibility that blockchain technology offers, being accessible 24 hours a day and allowing for immediate settlement. There are several other benefits to tokenizing securities, including transparency and fractionalization of assets that further increase accessibility. However, there are plenty of challenges with creating a fully decentralized securities exchange. Onboarding customers and new securities will both require following international regulations, including Know Your Customer laws and custody licenses.“The Power of Credit Delegation,” Talk by Aave founder Stani Kulechov. Highlights: Aave is a decentralized lending protocol built on Ethereum. The team behind the protocol has built a product that can provide zero-collateral loans. Kulechov believes this is a step forward in bringing DeFi liquidity into the real economy and driving up borrowing demand on Aave.“Things that Matter Outside of DeFi,” Talk by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Highlights: Beyond financial services, social media and public goods funding are two activities that have yet to take off on Ethereum. Buterin argues the network’s token economy and censorship resistance are two reasons why these activities could benefit from being built atop a decentralized blockchain.“Uniswap, DeFi & the Future of Consumer Finance,” Talk by Uniswap growth lead Ashleigh Schap. Highlights: Uniswap Labs is trying to create partnerships with blockchain infrastructure companies such as Talos, Paxos and Fireblocks to connect DeFi solutions into the backend of prominent fintech companies such as PayPal and E*Trade.“Why DEXs Are Eating the World,” Talk by Curve protocol developer Julien Bouteloup. Highlights: At its best, [decentralized finance] allows citizens of the world to have equal access to all currencies, equities, and financial platforms. As the space advances, decentralization will be on a spectrum. Regulators will watch over protocols that are used by the traditional financial world and users will still have access to the “Wild West” testing ground that DeFi is today. – Teddy OosterbaanSign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty may be set to increase for the first time since China’s crackdown on crypto mining in May. A rapid expansion of mining facilities in North America and the return of Chinese miners through overseas hosting sites are two major factors that will drive up mining difficulty, according to industry pros.  Mining difficulty is a metric to describe how hard it is to mine a block and get rewards in bitcoin. An increase in mining difficulty requires a miner to use more computing power to earn bitcoin, which reduces the miner’s profit margin. The more mining machines are online, the higher the mining difficulty and the more secure the Bitcoin network.. Mining difficulty has seen a continuous decrease since the Chinese central government called for local authorities to shut off bitcoin mining operations across the country on May 21. The latest bi-weekly difficulty level posted on July 17 is the fourth downward adjustment since the crackdown. “For the first time since China’s hashrate went lights out, we’re anticipating next week’s adjustment to be positive, a roughly 1.75% increase,”  according to Seattle-based mining Luxor’s newsletter on Saturday. Even before China’s crackdown, big North American mining companies such as Marathon and Riot were already expanding their operations due to bitcoin’s historic bull run in early 2021, Luxor CEO Nick Hansen said. “While we saw the big hashrate drop across the network during that time, other miners were also deploying new hardware,” Hansen said. “It was just drowned out by the disconnections in China.” Marathon said it entered a binding letter of intent with the U.S.-based miner hosting services provider Compute North in May to run about 73,000 bitcoin miners as part of the hosting firm’s 300-megawatts (gw) data center in Texas. The Las Vegas-based company claimed its hashrate would reach 10.37 EH/s after all its mining machines are fully deployed. “I am personally expecting a positive difficulty adjustment next month because the displaced miners (from China) have since found new homes and they aren’t coming offline anytime soon,” said Azam Roslan, senior sales associate at Wattum, a New York-based mining company that offers hosting and mining machine brokerage services. Most of the growth that will drive up mining difficulty in the coming months would still be from the North American miners who planned expansion ahead of Beijing’s crackdown last year or in early 2021, Daniel Frumkin, researcher at Prague-based mining company Slush Pool, said. “The Chinese miners that were forced offline in the crackdown and did not find capacity available right away are more likely to take more than three months to get back online because, in most cases, they have to collaborate on building out more infrastructure,” Frumkin said.  The positive adjustment could be the beginning of a drastic surge in hashrate in the coming year.“I think we have reached that minimum low difficulty point and now we are going to start to grow unless there are other big government shakeups or changing bitcoin price,” Hansen said. So while Beijing’s crackdown on crypto mining might be a disaster for Chinese miners, it could be a windfall for the miners in the rest of the world. Mining companies in North America and central Asia have raked in wide profit margins due to the low mining difficulty. However, the window of opportunity is slowly closing on miners as mining companies across the world are scrambling to build out new hosting sites to run mining machines.“We are a long, long way away from where we were before the crackdown, but my guess is that adjustments will be positive for a long time,” Frumkin said.  Hasen expects that in about 12 months hashrate would return to the level before China’s crackdown, based on the average lead time to build out new mining facilities to host both new machines and those that come from the Chinese miners. “I do not think the positive adjustment is just a blip and we will see significant growth and probably exceed the all-time high before the crackdown given how much new capacities are being built,” Hansen said. Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after a near-20% price rally over the past few days. The cryptocurrency declined from $40,000 resistance as Amazon denied rumors it will accept bitcoin payments. Bitcoin was trading around $37,000 at press time and is down about 4% over the past 24 hours. Technical data suggests lower support around $34,000 could stabilize the current pullback. “Going forward, we expect bitcoin to keep pushing higher and test the upper end of the $30,000-$42,000 trading range,” wrote Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, in an email to CoinDesk. “We expect to see similar moves in altcoins, too, led by ether.”Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:“Only a conclusive break above $50,000 in BTC would attract fresh flows and signal a change in the broader direction for the market,” Balani wrote.Some analysts expect further upside in bitcoin as institutional buyers find value opportunities across cryptocurrencies. “As institutional investors have been waiting on the sideline to take positions, the current market move could be sustained during the week” wrote Elie Le Rest, partner at crypto hedge fund Exo Alpha, in an email to CoinDesk.The short-squeeze rally triggered the most active trading session this quarter in crypto markets, according to data from Skew.The increase in volumes has been driven by large buyers, typically institutions that have waited for a more directional trend on bitcoin since the end of May, according to Le Rest.Over 2 million BTC have returned to profitability based on their realized price after bitcoin rallied over the past few days, according to data from Glassnode. “This indicates that 11.2% of the circulating supply has an on-chain cost basis between $29K and $38K,” Glassnode tweeted Monday.Bitcoin’s drawdown, or the percentage decline from the peak near $63,000, narrowed to around 40% over the past week. Typically, drawdowns exceeding 50% indicate the start of a bearish trend, similar to 2014 and 2017-2018. The current drawdown suggests bitcoin’s intermediate-term downtrend is stabilizing given the sharp price bounce over the past few days. However, drawdowns can last much longer towards 70%-80%, which previously occurred near bear market troughs.Bitcoin’s one-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts, or bearish bets, relative to calls, or bullish bets, has come off sharply to 2% from 13% late last week, according to data provided by crypto derivatives analytics firm Skew. The one-week put-call skew has declined from 13% to 5%.The narrowing of the spread between prices for puts and calls essentially means investors are no longer seeking downside hedges in anticipation of an extended price drop, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.“After Monday’s short squeeze, some unregulated futures are back in a 10% contango, but the basis varies across the various venues, and the institutional traders still seem cautious,” according to a Tuesday report by Arcane Research.Contango, a term used to describe the bullish arbitrage, occurs when the bitcoin futures price is higher than the spot price. Since April, bitcoin’s contango has narrowed as bullish sentiment waned.“We’re still far away from the extreme contango of 50% from mid-April, but it is concerning that the traders in the unregulated offshore futures once again outpace the CME traders,” Arcane wrote.“The growing contango occurs as traders with a short bias are reluctant to re-enter short positions after Monday’s massive short squeeze.”With largest stablecoin, USDT, in the news again for inauspicious reasons, worried perma-bears might now be searching for the crypto market equivalent of a credit default swap – a derivatives instrument that allows buyers to bet on another trading counterparty’s creditworthiness. The answer to that might be a put option on tether, essentially a bet that the stablecoin’s price will fall below its ostensible redemption value of $1. Some traders have been actively scouting around for such a trade, according to some players in digital-asset markets. Although market makers have seen demand for a tether put, fulfilling that demand is difficult, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. Currently, there is no active market for put options on tether. Exchanges don’t find a business case there because, technically, there is no exposure to offset. Participants fearing a tether collapse need to find a put seller in over-the-counter (OTC) markets or approach market makers. That’s a costly affair. The solution may be dealing in a tether put at a much lower or out-of-the-money strike below $1.00. That would cost relatively less than buying a put at $1.00. Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended lower on Tuesday. In fact, everything was in the red except for dollar-linked stablecoins.Notable losers of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):aave (AAVE) -11.31%tezos (XTZ) -9.1%uniswap (UNI) -8.03%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Daily trading volume for bitcoin reached $9.2 billion, the highest since June 22, according to a report by Arcane Research. Trading volumes in bitcoin were previously trending downward, with some saying this was, in part, due to Wall Streeters “taking a break,” and heading out on summer vacations. Market action has been lackluster, with the price of bitcoin remaining stuck in a range between $30,000 and $40,000 since May. The recent spike in trading volume could signal that when there’s a market move, interest and activity quickly return.“The increasing volume amid bitcoin’s strength suggests that the strong recovery was supported by an influx of buyers, a healthy sign for the market,” said Arcane’s report. It’s notable that trading volumes were trending downwards and saw four consecutive days below $3 billion before yesterday’s rebound, according to the report. “Overall, the seven-day average trading volume remains substantially below its yearly average, and trading activity in bitcoin seems to be low so far this summer,” the Arcane analysts wrote. Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The one-week put-call skew has declined from 13% to 5%.The narrowing of the spread between prices for puts and calls essentially means investors are no longer seeking downside hedges in anticipation of an extended price drop.Ether’s one-week and one-month skews have seen similar drawdowns to 0% and 1%, respectively.The short-term skews have pulled back due to a flurry of call buying. On Friday, a trader bought a total of 2,000 call option contracts on bitcoin in multiple clips of 100 via over-the-counter (OTC) desk Paradigm. The buying was concentrated in July 30 expiry calls at strike prices of $33,000, $34,000 and $35,000. The trader also snapped up Aug. 6 expiry calls at strikes $34,000, $35,000, and $36,000.Similarly, ether call options saw increased demand over the weekend, as tweeted by Swiss-based data tracking platform Laevitas and Paradigm.A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.

Bitcoin is in rally mode, posting its largest daily gain in six weeks as shorts covered positions over the weekend. The cryptocurrency was trading around $38,874 at press time and is up 14.5% over the past 24 hours. Sentiment has shifted from extreme bearishness after a sharp correction in May and two months of consolidation between $30,000 and $40,000. Some analysts expect further upside and view the recent bounce as a trend reversal.“We turned bullish last Wednesday but weren’t expecting the short squeeze to happen quite so soon,” wrote QCP Capital in a Telegram chat. “We’ve been pleasantly surprised by how supported the market was after Wednesday and sentiment flipped decisively bullish into the weekend.” Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets: “This move higher feels more like a bounce back into a neutral state after being overstretched to the downside below $30K,” QCP wrote. “The real pain could be lurking from short gamma positions above the $40K level.”“Bitcoin momentum is back, and incremental endorsements on Wall Street could easily be the catalyst to help prices rally towards the $45,000 level,” wrote Edward Moya, strategist at Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk.Blockchain metrics are also showing positive signs for bitcoin. “Bitcoin has slowly trickled back into the hands of longer-term holders throughout these months after the dramatic sell-off from all-time highs in May,” wrote Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments, in an email to CoinDesk. “Historically this trend of entities that hold long term does not reverse quickly, which will likely result in further advance in price as we move towards Q4,” Rooney wrote.The strong bounce in bitcoin over the weekend occurred as shorts covered positions. Roughly 2,000 short positions were liquidated over a two-hour period, according to data from CryptoQuant. The short-squeeze rally occurred despite regulatory pressure surrounding stablecoins.“The short order liquidation amount in the past hour reached $640 million, which is the largest single-day liquidation volume in more than two months,” wrote WuBlockchain in a tweet on Monday.A strike price of $40,000 represents the largest source of open interest for the upcoming bitcoin options expiry this Friday, which could be a source of volatility. “BTC has been rangebound between $28K-$43K and most expect an upside squeeze to occur on a break above $40K,” wrote Coinbase in a newsletter to institutional clients on Saturday.“But with overwriting strategies forced to settle on lower strikes ($35K-$38K), a sharp short-covering rally will likely begin from lower levels,” Coinbase wrote.They missed out. Investors pulled money out of digital-asset funds as bitcoin dipped below $30,000 last week, according to a report Monday by CoinShares. Outflows coincided with negative sentiment that preceded a near-24% price jump in bitcoin over the past seven days.Monday’s crypto price rally – bitcoin jumped above $38,000 – could encourage digital-asset inflows because many investors have been on the sidelines since the sell-off in May.Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended up higher on Monday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):chainlink (LINK) +19.1%aave (AAVE) +16.2%bitcoin cash (BCH) +15.4%Notable loser: algorand (ALGO) -0.74%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin’s notorious volatility was enriching bulls on Monday. The bitcoin price has climbed 17% over the past 24 hours to clear $40,000 for the first time since mid-June. The largest cryptocurrency by market value, which dipped below $30,000 as recently as last week, has now climbed for a sixth straight day. Analysts in digital-asset markets attributed the latest climb in part to a short squeeze: Traders who had previously bet on further price declines scrambled to get out of their positions, while others were liquidated due to margin calls. So far in 2021, bitcoin is up 38%. That’s more than double the 18% year-to-date gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.

The world’s oldest crypto is changing hands for around $38,250, having cooled slightly after hitting a monthly high of around $39,850.Datamish data show a short squeeze appears to have driven prices higher as those betting on bitcoin heading lower had to sell in quick succession to cover. The reason remains unclear.“This price action is aligning with what we’ve been seeing the past couple of weeks,” said Daniel Kim, head of capital markets at Maple Finance. “Borrowing rates for USD have started to increase from its lows.”“We’ve also been seeing a significant increase in demand for USDC from institutional borrowers and the sentiment seems to be bullish following the news of Amazon participating in bitcoin,” Kim added.An unconfirmed single-source story in City A.M. has reported retail giant Amazon is looking to accept bitcoin payments by year’s end and is considering minting its own token by 2022. The retail giant is also seeking a Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead, CoinDesk previously reported.CoinDesk attempted to contact Amazon but did not receive a reply by press time.Others argue the rebound in crypto prices is a reaction to a range of good news coming from big tech and finance players from the U.S. markets.“Most prominently, there were conversations held last week between Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and Cathie Wood at the Bitcoin Conference where they talked about where they see bitcoin and cryptocurrencies going with respect to their own organizations,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of Australian crypto exchange BTC markets.Daily volume on the Bitstamp exchange is still relatively lower than the average from previous days this year but is beginning to show some signs of revival from the breakdown witnessed in May.Other notable cryptos in the top 10 by market capitalization are also posting gains over a 24-hour period with chainlink, polkadot and bitcoin cash up the most, between 8%-12%.UPDATE (July 26, 2021, 2:14 UTC): Adds details on bitcoin’s short squeeze.UPDATE (July 26, 2021, 5:25 UTC): Adds comment from Caroline Bowler.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cryptocurrency was trading around $32,000 at press time and is up about 2% over the past seven days. Ether, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, is holding above $2,000 and is up about 6% over the past week. Upside momentum is improving, which could keep crypto buyers active into the weekend. Some analysts expect a short-squeeze to push bitcoin above the 50-day moving average around $34,000 given oversold conditions on the charts. “For the first time in many weeks we are seeing bullish signs here and expect bitcoin to head towards the upper end of the $30,000-$40,000 range,” wrote Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, in an email to CoinDesk.Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets: “On the options front we have seen a good amount of covering between the $35,000-$40,000 strikes for the weekly maturity,” Balani wrote. “For the July expiry there is still decent open interest in the $35,000 strike, which should act as a ceiling for BTC for this month.”Overall, risk sentiment is improving in traditional and crypto markets as concerns about tighter monetary stimulus wane. On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) pledged to keep interest rates lower for longer and adjusted its policy stance to allow for a slight overshoot of the 2% inflation target. The ECB announcement along with a broad decline in global government bond yields contributed to higher stock prices over the past week. Aside from the reach for yield, improving sentiment and positive comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday kept crypto bulls active.Bitcoin options traders are pricing an 8% chance of the cryptocurrency rising to a new peak above $64,800 by Dec. 31, according to data source Skew. Additionally, six-month implied volatility, or investors’ expectations for price turbulence, has dropped to a more than two-month low of 80% at press time, having peaked at 122% on May 17.That implies investors expect the price consolidation to continue for a while, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. “If BTC retains the lower range of $30K, shorts will begin to squeeze as BTC moves to the middle point of the range, likely accelerating in the coming days/weeks,” wrote Sashimi Nakamoto on CryptoQuant. The chart below shows the bitcoin leverage ratio, which is open interest divided by exchange reserves, reaching the highest level since April. The bitcoin funding rate is slightly negative, which indicates higher short interest than long interest, according to Nakamoto. The funding rate measures the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets.Since June, total assets under management across exchange-traded and over-the-counter-traded digital asset investment products decreased by 14% to $34.8 billion. Compared with traditional asset classes, digital asset markets still have a “long way to go before more risk-averse investors are fully at ease,” according to a report by CryptoCompare.As non-fungible tokens gain popularity despite an overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, some NFT critics inside the market took to Twitter, blaming the non-crypto natives who cash out their ether immediately after NFT sales for the lackluster price movement of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.But according to multiple analysts and market participants, the impact of NFT sales, if any at all, remains a nonfactor on ether’s price. Instead, the complaint showcases many traders and investors’ frustrations in a dull market.The speculation “is more like a reflection of the current market sentiment,” Daniel Lv, co-founder of China-based blockchain Nervos Network, told CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen through a representative.The blame, though, isn’t completely irrational because growth in the NFT market has not quite slowed down partly because of the large number of endorsements it has received from non-crypto celebrities.Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended lower on Friday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):tezos (XTZ) +3.24%Notable losers: the graph (GRT) -4.82%polkadot (DOT) -4.1%nucypher (NU) -3.76%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Compared with traditional asset classes, digital asset markets still have a “long way to go before more risk-averse investors are fully at ease,” according to CryptoCompare.

Bitcoin was trading around $32,300 at press time and is up about 1% over the past week. The price recovery off $30,000 support stalled following positive comments from Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday. Technicals suggest upside is limited around $34,000 resistance. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Bitpanda, an Austrian financial services platform, described the trading environment across cryptocurrencies as a “roller coaster ride,” in an email to CoinDesk. “The price of Bitcoin has been producing lower highs and lower lows recently while remaining in a downtrend,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad wrote. “Even though pressure from sellers might be diminishing, buyers won’t turn things around until resistance is broken.”Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Bitcoin was already well bid ahead of The B Word conference on Wednesday. And now analysts are questioning whether Musk’s comments are enough to keep bitcoin bulls active.“The jury is still out on whether this positive spark will bring enough confidence to change the direction of the markets,” wrote Ulrik Lykke, executive director of crypto hedge fund ARK36, in an email to CoinDesk.“Investors should still be attentive to the risk and realize that this may indeed not be enough to bend the current downwards momentum,” Lykke wrote. Short-term holders who are underwater (holding bitcoin significantly below the acquisition cost) are in capitulation mode, according to data from Glassnode. The chart below shows the short-term holder market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, which is at the lowest level since January 2020. In a bearish price trend, a low MVRV ratio is typically aligned with capitulation events, according to Glassnode. Bitcoin’s dominance ratio, which measures bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total market capitalization of major cryptocurrencies, is stabilizing around 46%. The ratio has risen from a June low around 39%, which could signal further upside in bitcoin relative to other cryptocurrencies. It is possible that bitcoin is seen as a safe haven as altcoins experience sharper selloffs during bear markets similar to 2018.Ether has been consolidating relative to bitcoin over the past two months. The ETH/BTC ratio could see a short-term breakout, especially if ether holds above the $2,000 level.Financial regulators need to consider “the worst case scenario, the adverse scenario and the different likelihoods of those scenarios, and then assessing risk” when regulating stablecoins, Dan Burstein, general counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of Paxos, said in a TV interview at CoinDesk’s First Mover. The worst-case scenario would be a run on assets, according to Burstein. “If those assets are held in illiquid assets, or risky assets, then those might not be able to be sold for $1. And those tokens are then going to be under reserved, they’re going to break the buck, and they’re not really entitled to the name of stablecoins.” Reddit chooses Arbitrum: Arbitrum has been selected by Reddit to make the social media site’s Ethereum-based Community Points system ready for prime time. Rollups, a solution for the world computer’s limited capacity, temporarily bundle transactions on a sidechain so that more users can participate in the primary network. Reddit said Thursday that Arbitrum beat out 21 other entrants to become the winner of its “Scaling Bake-Off.” Other projects being considered included Solana, StarkWare and Polygon, to name a few. Ethereum-based authentication platform raises $27M: Magic, an Ethereum-based authentication platform that allows users to log into websites without relying on passwords or the centralized honeypots that store vast lists of them, has closed a $27 million funding round. The Series A round, announced Thursday, was led by Northzone and included Tiger Global, Volt Capital, CoinFund and Digital Currency Group (also the owner of CoinDesk). It brings Magic’s total funding to $31 million, following a $4 million seed round in May 2020 that included the likes of Placeholder, SV Angel and Naval Ravikant.Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended up higher on Thursday.

Bitcoin appears to have found its footing after Wednesday’s nearly 10% rise, its biggest gain since July 17, and may soon challenge the upper end of its monthslong trading range of $30,000 to $40,000.“We are now short-term bullish to the topside against the $30,000 region triple bottom with strong bullish divergence,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said. “In addition to this, the market is short gamma to the topside – a break above $35,000-$36,000 could trigger a quick short squeeze towards the $40,000-$42,000 range top.”Bitcoin bears have failed at least three times in the past two months to establish a foothold under $30,000. While prices did close (UTC) below the key support earlier this week, Wednesday’s jump to $32,000 negated the bearish breakdown.The persistent defense of the $30,000 mark has taken the shape of a so-called triple bottom pattern on the daily chart, which also shows a bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI). The pattern occurs when the indicator prints higher lows, contradicting weakness in price, and is a signal of seller exhaustion and scope for a price bounce.The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $34,500 may offer immediate resistance. According to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a breakout above the 50-day SMA would target the 200-day SMA near $44,000.Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance, also pointed to $35,000 as a critical level. “Order book flow looks good, but a lot of stale selling orders are coming up in the $35,000 area, which still need to be cleared,” Heusser said.Lastly, market participants who went “short gamma” by selling call options – or insurance against bullish moves – at or above $35,000 over the past few weeks may resort to hedging, that is buying spot or futures, if prices rise to above $35,000.That, in turn, may bolster the bullish move, possibly yielding a test of $40,000-$42,000, as anticipated by QCP Capital. Being short gamma means being an option writer (seller) regardless of whether the option is a call or put. Traders typically write options when they expect the underlying asset to see low-volatility consolidation. Bitcoin is currently trading at near $31,800, representing a 1% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20.The cryptocurrency rose from $29,800 to over $32,000 yesterday on a string of bullish news. The day ended with tech entrepreneur and provocateur Elon Musk saying that his aerospace company, SpaceX, holds bitcoin. Musk also said that he owns bitcoin, ether and dogecoin, and added that Tesla might relist bitcoin as a payments alternative.Also read: Elon Musk Says SpaceX Holds Bitcoin at ‘B Word’ ConferenceSign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Short-term momentum is improving, which could keep buyers active above the $30,000 support level as bullish sentiment returns.Buyers have consistently taken profits along the intermediate-term downtrend defined by a series of lower price highs on the charts.

The cryptocurrency touched a three-week low of $1,721 early today, having peaked above $4,000 in May, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Other prominent altcoins like XRP, cardano, uniswap, chainlink, and stellar are nursing declines around 10%. Bitcoin, the crypto market leader, is down 5% at $29,700.“We’re seeing risk-off moves in equity, FX and commodities,” said Edmond G., head of trading at B2C2. “Crypto isn’t immune from traditional market sentiment and is also caught up in the legs lower. So far, we’re seeing very little movement [higher in ETH] while heading into the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) 1559 upgrade proposed [for] Aug. 4.” Global equity markets faced selling pressure on Monday, while the dollar rose on concerns a rebound in coronavirus cases would derail the global economy. As a result, bitcoin and crypto, being at the far end of the risk curve, are suffering losses. According to some analysts, Ethereum’s impending upgrade aims to burn part of the transaction fees and make ether less inflationary.“The ether supply burn would be significant even with the growth of the layer 2 scaling solutions,” Noelle Acheson, head of markets insights at CoinDesk sister company Genesis Trading, said. ” Whatever amount ends up being burned, it will be more than what’s currently being burned, so the upgrade does reduce the supply growth.” Acheson said that while the upgrade wouldn’t directly reduce ether transaction fees, a sour spot for DeFi protocols and traders, it will “make them more transparent and manageable.”However, Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said markets priced in the bullish EIP narrative earlier this year. Ether nearly doubled to $4,000 in the four weeks to mid-May even as bitcoin traded between $50,000 and $60,000. Ether’s decoupling was mainly powered by the optimism surrounding the EIP upgrade. “Crypto markets are now in a slow grind lower and vulnerable to negative macro news,” Balani said in a WhatsApp call. “Ether and other altcoins will see a bloodbath if bitcoin slides toward $20,000.” The probability of bitcoin falling that low and nuking the broader market has increased, with the cryptocurrency looking to establish a foothold under $30,000. “When a price dumps and stays flatlined at the lows, forming a ledge,” that says the market is doomed, according to trader and analyst Alex Kruger. “You can see that in most charts in the past 24 hours.”According to Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance, $29,000 and $1,700 are crucial supports for bitcoin and ether, respectively. “How low can it go? Probably down to $20K,” he said. “If you look at the liquidity pool structure, there was not much trading on the way up, except a bit around $23,000.”Ether could run into stronger selling pressure, as blockchain data shows an increased flow of coins onto exchanges. “We are seeing lending platforms like BlockFi sending large amounts of ETH to Coinbase, possibly to liquidate,” Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen, said. The only positive news for crypto bulls is that the market is seeing low volumes while grinding lower. “It potentially signals that sellers are exhausted and that the market is waiting for some positive news,” Heusser said. Further, equity markets are showing signs of stability at press time. The European markets are trading higher, and the futures tied to the S&P 500 are pointing to a positive open with a 0.60% gain. “It could be a bounce time for crypto, as equity market panic looks to be over,” Kruger said. “It makes sense to move stop loses on bitcoin shorts higher to $31,000.”Also read: Bitcoin Drops Below $30K for First Time in 4 Weeks Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cryptocurrency was trading around $29,998 at press time and is down about 5% over the past week.Bitcoin has been locked in the broad price range of $30,000 to $40,000 since mid-May, and briefly broke below the $30,000 mark on June 22. The cryptocurrency fleetingly traded at $29,700 a day after the People’s Bank of China ordered the country’s major financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. “I am expecting a strong dip towards $22K,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG, in a telegram interview on Monday. Wall Street is seeing “too much froth” and current virus jitters are triggering widespread panic selling of every top performing asset, with bitcoin being right at the top of this list, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. Moya said that bitcoin could be vulnerable to a flash crash towards the $20,000 level, which “should attract many institutional buyers that have been waiting patiently on the sidelines,” “If the stock market sell-off intensifies, bitcoin and ethereum will easily extend their declines,” said Moya. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said the consolidation phase bitcoin is currently experiencing is “neutral.”But in her view, “a breakout is more likely than a breakdown.”  In April, the Bitcoin network was “so vibrant, it wasn’t difficult supporting prices above $50K,” said Charles Morris, founder of ByteTree Asset Management.However, in recent weeks, Morris said, the level of network activity has collapsed.“Now it is more in keeping with a $15K bitcoin price than a $50K,” he said.Bitcoin peaked just below $65,000 in mid-April.

Bitcoin traded lower on Monday, mirroring declines in traditional markets as investors pull away from risky assets because of concerns about weaker monetary and fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, including those caused by the Delta variant. Bitcoin was trading at around $30,600 at press time and is down about 3% over the past 24 hours. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is up about 4% year to date, compared with a roughly 12% return for the S&P 500 Index.Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Regulatory scrutiny regarding stablecoins is also weighing on cryptocurrencies. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a white paper on Friday outlining initial research for the nation’s digital currency project, which appears to challenge existing cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. “Cryptocurrencies are mostly speculative instruments, and therefore pose potential risks to financial security and social stability,” the PBOC’s white paper stated.“Some commercial institutions even plan to launch global stablecoins, which will bring three risks and challenges to the international monetary system, payment and clearing system, monetary policies, cross-border capital flow management, etc.,” the report said.Another source of selling pressure across risk assets could be the reduction of government stimulus. “Too much stimulus breeds complacency,” MRB Partners wrote in a research note published on Friday. MRB also noted widespread asset price inflation, which can lead to market imbalances similar to an episode in Japan in the 1980s that preceded a decade of low investment returns.The chart below shows bitcoin’s current range, which is similar to the sideways pattern of between $5,900 and $7,400 in 2018. The previous range, although more volatile than the current pattern, preceded a nearly 45% sell-off, which extended the bear market until prices recovered in mid-2019. A decline was also seen in ether (ETH) below the $400 price level in 2018, similar to the drop to below $2,000 last week.Bitcoin’s near-term volatility is starting to rise after declining from peak levels in June. Some analysts expect selling pressure could increase, causing bitcoin to break below $30,000 support.“Front-end vols have been hit the hardest, creating a very steep volatility term structure,” QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat. “It makes sense to roll short July positions to September given the significant dip in front-end vols.” “Front-end vols” refers to “short-term volatility.”“Bitcoin volatility has started to spike up and is trading close to 80% for July expiry,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We can see sharp moves on the downside if BTC breaks below $30,000 convincingly.”Balani also noted that options sellers have become more aggressive as bitcoin trades in a tight range. There has been more put writing at $30,000 and $32,000 strikes on the downside, he said. Digital-asset funds have attracted capital over the past two weeks, albeit at a slower pace as investors remain cautious after the crypto crash in May. It appears that investors are warming up to ether, which saw a third consecutive week of inflows, totaling $11.7 million, according to a report by CoinShares.As the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets discusses stablecoins at a meeting today, debates about how stablecoins should be regulated heated up. CoinDesk Columnist JP Koning wrote that regulators may have contributed to the fast growth of stablecoin supply because of their failure to close the “pseudonymity loophole” in such financial products earlier. In an academic paper titled “Taming Wildcat Stablecoins” released Saturday, Yale economist Gary Gorton and U.S. Federal Reserve attorney Jeffery Zhang said that without proper regulation, the world of stablecoins could evolve into one reminiscent of the 19th century’s free banking period in the U.S. It is not the first time for the analogy to be used, and Nic Carter, another CoinDesk columnist explained why. All digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended up lower on Monday. Notable losers: the graph (GRT) -8.56% polkadot (DOT) -7.98%aave (AAVE) -7.12%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The decline has flipped the crucial 50-week simple moving average (SMA) support of $32,250 into resistance.  On Sunday, 500 contracts of the $22,000 put option expiring on Dec. 31 changed hands via the institution-focused over-the-counter (OTC) desk Paradigm. Similar volume crossed the tape for the $20,000 put expiring on Dec. 31.“There was interest to buy BTC puts for December in a significant size,” Darius Sit, CEO of the Singapore-based QCP Capital, said. “We made the market for most of the large block trades over the weekend. There was decent interest to sell September BTC puts as well.”Market makers are always on the opposite side of traders/investors and run a direction-neutral portfolio. That essentially means buyers of the $20,000 and $22,000 puts expiring on Dec. 31 were investors, most likely adding downside hedges against long positions in the spot/futures market.A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the underlying asset, in this case, bitcoin.Overall, the options market is still biased bullish for the long term. The six-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts relative to calls, remains entrenched below zero. In plain English, longer duration calls or bullish bets are priced higher than puts.However, the one-week, one-month and three-month put-call skews are indicating a negative bias with bearish prints.Also read: Why Bitcoin Needs to Defend $30KBitcoin is currently changing hands near the lower end of the two-month-long trading range of $30,000 to $40,000.If the support at $30,000 gives away, traders who sold puts at $30,000 over the past few weeks may resort to hedging – taking a short position in the futures or spot market – leading to a deeper decline.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, a metric indicating the effort required to solve the complex cryptographic puzzle to mine blocks and validate transactions, recorded its fourth straight drop over the weekend. On Sunday, difficulty fell by 4.8% at block 691,488, having declined by a record 28% on July 3, according to data tracked by BTC.com. The difficulty rate now stands at an 18-month low of 13.67 trillion. That’s down 45% from the mid-May peak of 25.05 trillion. According to The Block, the network last recorded four consecutive declines in difficulty in 2011.The bitcoin mining difficulty undergoes automatic adjustment every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes. The reward for mining blocks and approving transactions is currently 6.25 BTC. The time taken to mine new blocks rises when there is a drop in the amount of computing power applied to the blockchain. At that point, the programmed code kicks pushes the difficulty lower to attract more miners and restore the average block time to 10 minutes. “Since May, the blockchain has been running slowly. Earlier this month, the average block time reached 1,000 seconds, when they ought to average around 600 seconds.” Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, said. “To rectify that, the blockchain needed to speed up and make mining easier. The last four adjustments have been downward, and it now looks like the blockchain is back to normal,” Morris said. The self-adjusting mechanism makes bitcoin mining somewhat analogous to perfect competition, a hypothetical market structure where forces of demand and supply interact freely and firms’ decisions are predictable. The difficulty rate peaked at over 25 trillion in the second half of May and has been falling ever since amid China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency mining. The mean hashrate peaked along with the price in mid-April and hit a two-year low of 61.22 exahashes per second (EH/s) in late June. Since then, it has recovered slightly to 96 EH/s, according to Glassnode data. The dramatic decline in both the hashrate and difficulty could be a short-term phenomenon, as there is evidence that China-based miners shifting to the U.S. and Kazakhstan could soon become operational.  “This is a one-off event, meaning most of this mining power will return, and before you know it, MORE than 900 coins per day will be mined since the hash rate will hit the network after the difficulty of each block decreases,” Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, noted in a Substack post published last month. Also read: Bitcoin’s ‘Puell Multiple’ Flashes Misleading Bullish Signal as China Bans MiningThe drop in the mining difficulty has not had any bearish effect on the cryptocurrency’s price, leaving it directionless in existing ranges. Social media chatter shows some traders are worried about a deeper drop as prices ended Sunday (UTC) below $34,000, marking the lowest weekly close of the year.

In technical terms, this is known as capitulation.”Earlier this month, Circle, the company behind the fast-growing dollar-linked stablecoin USDC, announced plans to become a public company at a $4.5 billion valuation, via a deal with a special-purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC).Charlie Morris, founder of ByteTree Asset Management, speculated this week the deal could end up luring more investors to cryptocurrencies.  It’s “unquestionably the starter stock for the cautious,” Morris wrote July 14 in his weekly newsletter. Big investors might find the stock hard to resist due to USDC’s fast growth: The stablecoin’s supply has soared to more than $25 billion, from about $3.9 billion at the start of the year. “It’s clear to the eye this company is growing like a weed,” Morris wrote. What might make the new shares more attractive for portfolios is that USDC “powers crypto, yet has none of the volatility, making it a natural haven in comparison to the asset managers or miners whose fortunes are linked to crypto prices,” according to Morris. But that might just be a camel’s nose under the tent: “The old world will end up owning all of these stocks regardless, and that is why index funds always amuse me. They just buy whatever is stuck in front of them, meaning that investors who are trying hard to avoid crypto will end up owning it. Before long, everyone will be invested in crypto and crypto stocks, whether they like it or not, and Circle’s listing will be a crowd pleaser.”The parabolic growth in the market cap of stablecoin giant tether (USDT) suddenly came to a grinding halt at the end of May, just as bitcoin’s price was coming off its all-time highs. According to analysts and market participants who spoke to CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen, the sudden pause reveals that the most traded cryptocurrency in the world is seeing its dominance threatened by three unprecedented challenges combining in a perfect storm to rattle the stablecoin.An executive from Tether, while acknowledging the demand for USDT has fallen, argued the trend is not exclusive to the token.“Demand for tether ebbs and flows, and has been impacted by lower demand in recent weeks,” Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said in a written response via a spokesperson.Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended lower on Friday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):stellar (XLM) +3.37%eos (EOS) +3.12%Notable losers: polkadot (DOT) -5.4%yearn finance (YFI) -5.26%algorand (ALGO) -4.79%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But 44% say it will never happen.The “Bitcoin price prediction 2021” report, published Thursday, canvassed a panel of 42 experts from finance, technology and academia. Some respondents (15%) see that dominance point, labeled “hyperbitcoinisation” in the U.K. study, occurring as early as 2035.Adoption by the developing world is seen as the key driver, with 33% of respondents saying bitcoin will become the currency of choice in developing nations within 10 years. A further 21% say that level of adoption is more than 10 years away.“The momentum will only pick up,” said Amber CEO Aleks Svetski, one of the panelists, citing El Salvador’s decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender and its wide use in Venezuela as a means of beating hyperinflation. “The beauty is also that these broken nations will transform faster than major nations as bitcoin undermines the nation-state model.” The panel predicted bitcoin’s price will have climbed to $318,417 by December 2025. That’s 61% higher than in a similar survey conducted December 2020.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A report earlier this week showed that U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in 13 years. Federal Reserve officials have characterized the uptick as “transitory,” a rationale for maintaining low interest rates and monthly purchases of $120 billion in Treasury or mortgage securities without fears of runaway prices.  It’s a crucial matter for bitcoin traders who have bet either that the cryptocurrency will hold its value as the dollar’s purchasing power weakens or that it would face selling pressure as a risky asset if the Fed moves to rein in its monetary stimulus. “We’re experiencing a big uptick in inflation, bigger than, than many expected, bigger certainly than I expected,” Powell said. “And we’re trying to understand whether it’s something that will pass through fairly quickly, or whether we’re in fact, we need to act one way or the other.”Separately, Powell said he was undecided on whether the benefits of central bank digital currencies outweigh the costs. “The more direct route” would be to regulate stablecoins, Powell said, as reported by CoinDesk’s Nate DiCamillo. “Our obligation is to explore both the technology and the policy issues over the next couple of years, so that we’re in a position to make an informed recommendation.” The remarks came a day after Powell testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that “you wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies,” if there were a digital dollar. The simplistic days of trading by scanning technical charts and the spot market order book are passé, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.The bitcoin market has matured since the March 2020 crash, and participants can no longer turn a blind eye toward macroeconomic developments and activity in the futures and options market. That was especially the case on Thursday, when the sentiment against assets deemed to be risky on Wall Street put downward pressure on bitcoin and pushed the cryptocurrency toward the $30,000 support level, which, if breached, could invite more selling pressure from options traders, leading to a quick slide. With bitcoin locked in the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000 since mid-May, many options traders have been selling puts at the $30,000 strike and selling calls at the $40,000 strike. But bitcoin is pushing toward the lower end of the range at $30,000. If that level breaks, traders who sold puts at that level may resort to hedging downside risk by shorting bitcoin futures or selling bitcoin on the spot market. “If support or resistance levels break, traders will need to quickly hedge because prices will move to new levels fast,” Greg Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, said. “The hedging activity from various traders on the same side of the volatility trade also creates a self-reinforcing event.”Web search data shows the general populace has lost interest in bitcoin, thanks to the usually volatile cryptocurrency going silent in recent weeks, Godbole reports.Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 19 for the worldwide search query “bitcoin price” over the past five years.That’s the lowest reading since December and marks a significant decline from the peak of 86 observed two months ago. Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google and scales their searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company.The cryptocurrency’s two-month-long dull price action of $30,000 to $40,000 seems to have driven away retail interest, which surged earlier this year.The Lightning Network has increased its capacity by 100 bitcoin in just five days, the fastest growth ever, CoinDesk’s Myles Sherman reports. The network capacity has climbed to record levels above 1,800 BTC locked in, data show. In April, the network reached a milestone of 10,000 nodes and had just over 45,000 payment channels holding 1,158 BTC. The number of nodes has since more than doubled to 22,781, while the number of channels jumped to 56,103. For context, it took nearly a year for the number of nodes to double last time from 5,000 to 10,000. Lightning Network’s development has been slow, steady and cautious – like anything else that promises to be a major step forward for Bitcoin. But as other coins and chains touted “faster, cheaper transactions,” many bitcoiners were becoming increasingly impatient for Lightning to be ready for prime time. Even now it’s not quite there, and developers caution users that it’s still in the early stages of development.The big picture is that the Bitcoin network by itself is seen as slow, processing up to seven transactions per second. That “throughput” would need to increase by magnitudes in the thousands or even millions in order to host the global economy, mostly because any blocks written above 1 megabyte are invalid on the current Bitcoin mainnet. “With on-chain fees going up with bitcoin appreciation cycle, it’s becoming an imperative to use Lightning as a low-cost alternative to transfer smaller amounts of bitcoin,” Oleg Mikhalsky, a partner at Fulgur Ventures, a firm that specializes in researching and investing in Lightning-focused projects, told Sherman. Read More: Nodes on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Double in 3 MonthsMost digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended up lower on Thursday. In fact everything was in the red except for dollar-linked stablecoins.

The simplistic days of trading bitcoin by scanning technical charts and the spot market order book are passé. The bitcoin market has matured since the March 2020 crash, and participants can no longer turn a blind eye toward macroeconomic developments and activity in the futures and options market. That was especially the case on Thursday, when the risk-off mood on Wall Street put downward pressure on bitcoin and pushed the cryptocurrency toward $30,000 support, which, if breached, could invite more selling pressure from options traders, leading to a quick slide. With bitcoin locked in the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000 since mid-May, many options traders have been selling puts at the $30,000 strike and selling calls at the $40,000 strike. These trades were booked on Deribit and other crypto-derivatives exchanges in hopes the consolidation would continue, leading to a drop in the implied volatility and the value of calls and puts. A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy. In plain English, selling a put option is akin to offering insurance to the put buyer against a price sell-off below a particular level – in this case $30,000. “After the mid-May selling, volatility hit peak heights, but since then spot prices have been trading in a base range. These types of consolidation periods are perfect environments for lower-volatility trades,”  said Greg Magadini, CEO and co-founder of Genesis Volatility. “The main idea is for prices to meander between support and resistance, and traders sell options expecting these levels to hold.”But bitcoin is pushing toward the lower end of the range at $30,000. If that level breaks, traders who sold puts at that level may resort to hedging downside risk by shorting bitcoin futures or selling bitcoin in the spot market. That, in turn, could add to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency, leading to a more profound price drop. “If support or resistance levels break, traders will need to quickly hedge because prices will move to new levels fast,” Magadini said. “The hedging activity from various traders on the same side of the volatility trade also creates a self-reinforcing event.” Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin was flat, holding around $33,000, after falling for two straight days. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now in its eighth straight week of trading roughly sideways. Analysts said bitcoin trading was buoyed along with assets in traditional markets by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s assurances that he’s still not seeing “substantial further progress” on an economic recovery – signaling that the U.S. central bank isn’t likely to dial back monetary stimulus anytime soon. Powell’s comments come after Tuesday’s U.S. Labor Department report that inflation accelerated in June by the fastest pace in 13 years. Bitcoin is seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation because of the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply schedule. “What helped cryptocurrencies turn positive was the broad-based rally on Wall Street,” Edward Moya, senior market strategist at Oanda, wrote in an email. “The Fed seems stubbornly dovish and willing to tolerate a few more months of surging pricing pressures before considering a change of tune over the transitory/persistent inflation debate.”  Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Ether tracked higher with bitcoin, but among altcoins the day’s big story was a jump in price for the FOX token after the backing ShapeShift exchange announced plans to become more decentralized and airdrop the token.   With bitcoin stuck in the $30,000 and $40,000 range for eight weeks now, cryptocurrency analysts are scouring blockchain data for clues on which way the market will go.  David Grider, head of digital assets at FundStrat, wrote Wednesday in a weekly report that he is looking closely at the “spent output profit ratio,” or SOPR. The metric is calculated by dividing the average price at which bitcoin was sold by the average price at which it was bought. Writes Grider: “When SOPR is above 1, it implies owners of the asset are in profit at the time of the transaction. Below 1 implies sellers have capitulated and sold at a loss.”The metric has stayed below 1 since May, possibly a sign there’s a “healthy reset of profit taking,” reminiscent of a similar episode that played out in March 2020, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Several months after that, bitcoin prices rallied and ended up quadrupling on the year. “In a bull market, as we expect we are in today, a SOPR below 1 can indicate a local bottom as sellers are reluctant to sell at a loss,” Grider wrote. Jerome Powell spent much of his semiannual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee addressing the outlook for the U.S. economy, the prospects for inflation and the likely path of monetary policy. He was also questions on cryptocurrencies, as reported by CoinDesk’s Nate DiCamillo.U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the. ranking Republican on the committee, asked when the Fed would deliver its much-anticipated report on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and crypto. Powell said that report, previously expected to arrive this month, will appear in September.“U.S. regulation, along with environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns, are the biggest risks to cryptos, so a September Fed release of [the central bank’s] concerns on digital currencies should be viewed as good news for bitcoin,” according to Oanda’s Moya.   Powell also weighed in on stablecoins, arguing they will need to be more closely regulated if they are going to be a major part of U.S. payments networks. “Stablecoins certainly have some advantages in terms of faster payment systems and have some attributes of CBDCs, but there are some risks with stablecoins right now,” Powell said. “I think the issue is that stablecoins are a lot like money market funds or bank deposits or a narrow bank.”In response to a question from Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), Powell said the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency isn’t in danger of being threatened, even as other countries develop CBDCs.The chairman said central bank digital currencies might undermine the case for decentralized digital assets.“You wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency,” Powell said. “I think that’s one of the stronger arguments in its favor.” Crypto trading pioneer ShapeShift is closing its doors, handing over its legacy to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) controlled by holders of its FOX token.As it begins a months-long process of closing up shop, it will begin by airdropping $98 million in crypto to decentralized finance (DeFi) investors across multiple blockchains. Following the news, the price of ShapeShift’s exchange token FOX surged. FOX was changing hands at $0.51 as of press time; before the news went out this morning, the token was trading at $0.28. It hit $0.68 about an hour after the 11:00 a.m. ET announcement.Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):stellar (XLM) +5.31%bitcoin cash (BCH) 1.79%aave (AAVE) +1.37%Notable losers: tezos (XTZ) -5.26%algorand (ALGO) -3.83%polkadot (DOT) -3.78%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Key to defending Ethereum against these MEV forces is the upcoming transition to Eth 2.0 and proof-of-stake (PoS). But will the transition come soon enough? This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.Bitcoin dominance tends to fall every crypto bull market cycle. As background, BTC dominance is a metric tracking the percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization made up by BTC. During the most recent bull market cycle, BTC dominance dropped from roughly 70% in January to as low as 40% in May. While the volatile crypto markets have since turned bearish over the latter half of Q2 2021, causing BTC dominance to pick back up again, the metric continues to trend between the range of 40% and 50%. Among the alternative cryptocurrencies eating up the market share of BTC, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, ether, is the next largest coin, making up roughly 18% of total crypto market share. While ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency next to BTC and has been since as early as 2016, it is not the fastest-growing altcoin on the market. In 2021 Q2, the fastest-growing altcoin, excluding stablecoins, by monthly market cap growth, was the native token of Chiliz, a blockchain services network for sports and entertainment providers.The chiliz token (CHZ) is the exclusive marketplace currency on Socios.com. Socios.com aims at decentralizing fanbase interaction with sports teams by leveraging blockchain infrastructure to facilitate payments for team merchandise, voting rights and other rewards. The marketplace has partnered with over 20 sporting and esports organizations including FC Barcelona, Juventus and Atletico de Madrid. Fans for each of these teams can purchase branded “Fan Tokens” on Socios.com that allow them to vote on certain team decisions such as renaming facilities or changing entrance songs. Since the CHZ is the exclusive means of exchange in the marketplace, the token accrues in value alongside demand for voting rights and rewards provided by the entertainers on the Socios.com platform. The sports industry alone has a yearly value in the hundreds of billions of dollars and could gain further value through strong customer loyalty programs like the ones being experimented on through CHZ and Socios.com. The Chiliz token is one way to speculate on the use of Ethereum-based tokens for fan engagement and the continued growth of the Socios.com marketplace as the main platform to do this. Teddy OosterbaanBlock subsidies, transaction fees and miner/maximal extractable value (MEV): These are the three main revenue streams of Ethereum miners. In efforts to combat currency inflation, protocol developers lowered block subsidies from 5 ETH to 3 ETH in 2017, and again from 3 ETH to 2 ETH in 2019. Starting in August 2021, transaction fees are also expected to decline as a result of Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 and its fee-burning mechanism. The only revenue stream that is expected to grow larger and more lucrative for miners in the months to come is MEV. MEV refers to the income a miner receives as a direct result of their ability to insert, leave out and reorder transactions within a block. The order of transactions is of utmost importance in the context of high-frequency trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) where automated bots can identify buy or sell orders waiting for execution on Ethereum and front-run these trades before they get executed. The higher the liquidity and value being moved on-chain through these DEXs, the greater the profit opportunity for miners to earn additional income through MEV. *Missing values for daily extracted MEV appear in this chart as interpolated dotted lines that connects the plot points immediately preceding and succeeding the missing valueThe larger MEV rewards become in comparison to block subsidies and transaction fees, the greater the financial incentive for miners to adjust not only the order of transactions but also the order of blocks themselves. In what is known as a “time bandit” attack, miners may begin to identify MEV opportunities in blocks that have already been finalized and reorganize the blockchain in their favor if potential rewards from frontrunning are larger than earnings from honest mining (i.e., block subsidies and transaction fees).Speaking to the potential for miners to reorganize Ethereum blocks and disrupt chain finality, Georgios Konstantopoulos and Leo Zhang from Paradigm Research wrote in a blog post back in March, “This scenario is not obviously plausible: Miners are (for the most part) structurally long ETH, and such an action would directly negatively impact their ETH investment.”However, it would appear the tools for MEV extraction by way of block reorganization are actively being built and already being executed in primitive forms. Edgar Aroutiounian of Flashbots tweeted on Thursday, July 8, that he had created a personal GitHub repository codifying how payments to miners can be facilitated in exchange for destabilizing blockchain consensus. Shortly thereafter, on Saturday, July 10, Twitter user “0xbunnygirl” announced their own code repository for MEV extraction through block reorgs called “Request for Reorg.” While the possibility of MEV negatively impacting chain finality and immutability has been a long-running concern, discussed as early as November 2020 among Ethereum researchers, the reality of this happening appears to be manifesting today. In light of this reality, there are a handful of defense mechanisms that researchers insist will protect the integrity of Ethereum’s blockchain. First, there is the collective will of the Ethereum community to censor this kind of behavior. Users can leave mining pools that are using their computational power, also called hashrate, to reorg blocks. Honest miners can resist accepting blocks they know to be from hostile miners engaging in these MEV practices. Second, there is the forthcoming upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol with Eth 2.0, after which miners will no longer have the ability to propose blocks or reorder transactions within blocks. These two responsibilities will fall into the hands of validator node operators, who are required to own a large investment of ETH, worth roughly $63,600 or 32 ETH, and have skin in the game in order to participate in blockchain consensus. Neither of these two defenses is convincing. The former assumes the collective will of the community is homogeneous and aligned on resisting MEV extraction through block reorgs despite clear evidence to the contrary. For some, such as Aroutiounian, if block reorgs can be done on Ethereum and there is a clear financial incentive for them to happen, they should – regardless of how it impacts public perception of the network. The upgrade to Eth 2.0 and PoS as a defense against block reorgs for MEV extraction does not address the present reality and the impact these events can have on the value of Ethereum in the interim before the upgrade is ready for deployment. The readiness checklist which outlines all the tasks needed for PoS activation remains in large part unfinished.

When it comes to USDC deposits, customers might prefer lower risk, lower reward. Coinbase’s below-market interest rate on deposits of the stablecoin USDC might reveal confidence in its own strength – a bet that customers will view the cryptocurrency platform as a safe place to keep their money. When the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange rolled out the new deposit service last week for the dollar-linked stablecoin USDC, at a rate of 4%, it touted the ability to pay customers “more than 50x the national average of a traditional savings account.”Coinbase didn’t go out of its way to highlight that other crypto lending platforms are offering depositors higher rates – in the neighborhood of 8%. The crypto lender Celsius, for example, is currently advertising an annualized percentage yield (APY) on USDC deposits of 8.88%.Asked about the below-market deposit rate, Coinbase pointed to the hazards of lending money to platforms that might be more risky: “We have recently seen the rise of crypto interest accounts that offer attractive rates on customers’ assets,” a Coinbase representative said in an emailed response to questions sent by CoinDesk. “While the high interest rates are appealing, they can present varying levels of risk,” the representative added. “When you read the full terms and conditions, you may find that your assets are loaned to unidentified third parties and subject to their credit risk, which could result in a total loss of your crypto holdings.”Such commentary highlights an increasingly relevant question as more cryptocurrency firms try to woo big institutional investors and companies to digital-asset markets with promises of high returns: What is the creditworthiness of the lender that’s accepting the deposits, and will it be able to repay them when depositors ask to redeem?   Just as big companies typically pay lower interest rates on bonds than a smaller junk-grade issuer, Coinbase might be betting that it can get away with paying a lower interest rate on deposits because it’s a big, well-known player in the cryptocurrency industry, with a stock that’s publicly traded – meaning it has to publicly disclose financial statements and a welter of information about its risks.    “We don’t know the exact legal structure Coinbase has this wrapped in, but 4% might not be a bad rate for accessing the debt markets if it falls under the camp of an unsecured liability of the company,” David Grider, lead digital asset strategist at Fundstrat, wrote in his weekly newsletter on June 30. “But many users will rightfully view Coinbase as a highly creditworthy borrower and find the ability to ‘lend to them’ attractive.” Circle, the crypto native financial services firm that powers the USDC stablecoin, also offers an APY of around 4% on its USDC Circle Yield product. Circle Yield is “an institutional-grade product,” Jeremy Allaire, CEO at Circle, recently said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”“The USDC that is lent out is overcollateralized on our platform, which is very significant,” he said.Compound Labs’ newly launched Compound Treasury business offers an APY of around 4% on deposits of U.S. dollars, which are then converted into USDC and invested in Compound’s decentralized lending protocol. The Compound Treasury website says the accounts are offered by “Compound Prime LLC,” which according to regulatory filings is a company incorporated in Delaware. The accounts are offered in part by the digital asset firm Fireblocks Inc. and Fireblocks LLC, a money-services business, according to the website. Coinbase’s comparatively low interest rate might be well-timed in terms of the market dynamics: Some cryptocurrency lenders have recently been reducing their deposit rates, partly because the market has cooled from earlier in the year. BlockFi, Ledn and Matrixport have cut their interest rates on deposits of USDC for July amid changing market conditions, while the rates on top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as dYdX, Aave and yearn.finance are already as low as 0.47%.BlockFi’s new interest rates for USDC deposits in July are between 5% and 7.5% depending on the size of the deposits. Ledn and Matrixport are in the range of 6.5% to 9.5%.“The borrowing demand is not great,” Cynthia Wu, head of business development and sales at Hong Kong-based Matrixport, said. With bitcoin’s price “rangebound around $30,000, there’s not much to do.”The fear with depositing tokens to a lending platform is that the company might run into trouble. The accounts aren’t backed by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insurance, as is the case with savings deposits at a U.S. bank.As Grider wrote, the risks are plentiful: “If the lenders’ assets become impaired somehow during a sell-off where liquidated collateral doesn’t cover loans issued, or during a hack lose funds, or due to the default of an uncollateralized counterparty, or due to improper management – users can lose a substantial portion of their funds, since these types of institutions are not regulated like banks.” CoinDesk reported in June that the cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust had cut its contract with Celsius, citing “red flags.” A person familiar with the situation, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Prime Trust’s risk team was concerned about Celsius’ strategy of “endlessly rehypothecating assets.”A Celsius spokesperson told CoinDesk that the company has “never rehypothecated” New York residents’ crypto assets. Under Celsius’ terms of service, the company also holds assets for customers in Texas and Washington state. Celsius “may lend, sell, pledge, hypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of assets and Eligible Digital Assets to counterparties or hold the Eligible Digital Assets with counterparties, and we will use our best commercial and operational efforts to prevent losses,” according to the terms. In early June, Celsius announced that it had invested more than $200 million in mining equipment and other investments. Other crypto lenders, still providing relatively higher APYs for their USDC deposits such as Nexo and Voyager Digital – with APYs of 12% and 9%, respectively – say their higher rates are justified by how they manage depositors’ funds.“There are, naturally, moments when we have slightly more funds earning interest,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo, said in an email response via a representative. “In these situations, we engage in market-neutral trading strategies to generate yields.”Trenchev predicted that Coinbase’s entry to the USDC yield-earning products would eventually push “subpar” platforms out of the market.“This process is already becoming evident,” Trenchev said. “Unsustainable services are slowly losing traction.” “At Voyager, we conduct proper due diligence and risk mitigation analysis before we loan out any assets,” Steve Ehrlich, Voyager’s CEO and co-founder, said via a representative. “Voyager only loans out assets to highly vetted financial institutions that are regulatory compliant and well-capitalized, each with a trusted base of counterparties.”Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The U.S. Consumer Price Index jumped by 5.4% in the 12 months through June, exceeding the 4.9% increase expected by economists.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 4.5% year over year, also higher than economists’ expectations of a 4% increase. On a month-to-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.9%, higher than the expected 0.5%, and accelerating from May’s 0.6% pace. Excluding food and energy, the index also rose 0.9% on the month. The CPI report, released Tuesday by the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), shows an economy that’s working through supply constraints while trying to meet increasing demand as the country reopens, with business lockdowns ending and coronavirus vaccines reaching more people. This was the fastest one-month increase since June 2008, according to the Labor Department. “Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, new vehicles, airline fares and apparel,” the Labor Department wrote. “The index for medical care and the index for household furnishings and operations were among the few major component indexes which decreased in June.”Used car prices will reverse, said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon.“Auction prices soared in the spring because rental companies had to rebuild their fleets quickly to meet rebounding demand, but had to buy used vehicles at auction because the chip shortage meant they could not find sufficient numbers of new vehicles,” Shepherdson said. “This drove up auction prices, and the increase has then been magnified by dealers taking the opportunity to add extra margin on top. But auction prices dipped in June, and the next few months likely will bring steep declines as the fleet buyers leave the market.”Rising rents caused shelter costs to rise 0.5% month over month. “Rents are the biggest element of the core CPI, accounting for 41% of the index, and they are now rising slightly faster” than before COVID-19, Shepherdson added. “We expect a further gradual acceleration, given the surge in home prices, the low vacancy rate and faster wage growth”The CPI report is particularly important for some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

An analyst who predicted the bitcoin mid-May price slide says the cryptocurrency’s current range play is likely to be resolved on the higher side.“The consolidation phase itself is neutral, but we think a breakout is more likely than a breakdown,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a research note published on Monday. “Intermediate-term momentum has been improving based on the MACD histogram.”Bitcoin has been trading between $30,000 and $40,000 since late May. The price range has narrowed further in the past two weeks, with bulls unwilling to send prices above $36,000 and sellers refusing to step in below $32,000.A big move looks overdue and could be bullish, as the weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has turned higher, having bottomed out in mid-June.The consecutive shallow bars below the zero line indicate seller exhaustion.The stochastic indicator continues to indicate oversold conditions with a below-20 print. “Intermediate-term oversold conditions have generated stabilization above $30,000, which has proven to be strong support for bitcoin,” Stockton said.According to Stockton, the expected breakout would be confirmed on consecutive daily UTC closes above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $35,500. That would open the doors to the next resistance level, near $44,000.Also read: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops as Traders Await June CPI Inflation Report The 50-day SMA is one of the most widely-tracked technical lines. Stockton mentioned it as the level to defend for the bulls back in April, when prices were trading well above average. The SMA support was breached on April 20 and was followed by a sell-off in May.At press time, bitcoin is trading little changed on the day near $33,200. A break below the long-held support at $30,000 could invite chart-driven sellers. However, Stockton sees a low probability of a range breakdown.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin continues to be in a lull, with its price locked in a narrow range of $32,000 to $35,000 for more than two weeks. Due to prolonged consolidation, popular indicators like the relative strength index are no longer suggesting directional bias.However, a chart analysis of long-term moving price averages suggests more bearishness ahead. The cryptocurrency’s 100-day simple moving average (SMA) is about to cross below the 200-day SMA for the first time since May 2020.The so-called bearish crossover comes weeks after the 50- and 200-day SMAs charted the “death cross.” Bearish crossovers of longer duration averages often lag price action and trap traders on the wrong side of the market.For instance, bitcoin barely saw any bearish moves following the previous bear cross of 100- and 200-day SMAs in May 2020. A similar bear cross was observed in April 2018, October 2014 and April 2014, coinciding with interim price bottoms. The one observed in November 2019 was followed by a deeper price decline. That said, the absence of solid follow-through to the repeated defense of the $30,000 support in the past few weeks is a cause for concern.According to Katie Stockton, founder, and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a move above the 50-day SMA resistance at $35,621 may bring more buyers, lifting prices above $40,000.The immediate support is seen at $32,100 (July 8 low) followed by $30,000. At press time, bitcoin was trading near $33,700, representing a 1.5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

While Fed officials  have discussed crypto before, they have seldom, if ever, used the asset class as a benchmark to consider broader market conditions.Small shifts point to the Fed giving crypto a closer look. Top brass have met with key industry figures in recent months as they prepare to tackle more questions about crypto, such as how to proceed on a digital dollar project.Even so, one small shoutout doesn’t amount to a sea change. The 69-page report declined to elaborate further on crypto assets or their resiliency, prospects and impact on monetary policy. It bundled the mention within a broader section on the price of “risky assets,” sandwiched between housing prices and Treasury yields.“Asset prices may be subject to significant declines should investor risk appetite fall, interest rates rise unexpectedly or the recovery stall,” the section ended.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is up about 6% over the past week and is expected to hold support above $30,000 into the weekend. In traditional markets, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached all-time highs after a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday. For now, sentiment for risky assets appears to be alive as well as volatility declines in both traditional markets and bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Bitcoin’s implied volatility remains elevated despite rangebound trading since mid-May, according to options data provider Skew. This suggests traders are not complacent given the recent stabilization in price. There is still some uncertainty present in the options market at the beginning of July. “$34,000 is a key level for accelerated moves to the up or downside with highest gamma exposure for both puts and calls,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.“As spot trades lower, the market has yet to find its footing,” Balani wrote. “As long as players write upside exposure in size, a rangebound play with more downside risk seems likely.”Crypto related stocks such as Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) have outperformed bitcoin over the past few months, albeit within a tight range. Some traders are looking for a breakout or breakdown in stocks as a leading signal for bitcoin in the coming weeks. COIN registered a downside exhaustion signal in June, confirmed by DeMark indicators. The stock will need to see a break above $260 to shift the downtrend since its April debut.The bitcoin market could get a boost this month from the expiration of investor restrictions on the sale of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund. Grayscale is owned by the Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.Some digital asset analysts and investors say it’s possible some of these investors might need to enter the market to buy bitcoin in order to repay cryptocurrency loans they used to finance their original purchases of the GBTC shares.Most digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 ended up lower on Friday.Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET): the graph (GRT) +7.39%cardano (ADA) +3.61%nuCypher (NU) +3.35%Notable losers: eos (EOS) -1.73%yearn Finance (YFI) -1.36%stellar (XLM) -1.32%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The number is still down by roughly half from the peak rate reached in mid-May, according to data from Glassnode. The majority of the reduction stemmed from China’s move to shut down cryptocurrency mining operations in the country, with a little bit from Iran, according to Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform. “We believe there isn’t much active hashrate left in China,” Doctor said in an email to CoinDesk. “What is left is probably not mining openly, and may continue until either they get shut down or they can get equipment out of China and find an alternative place to move them.” Meanwhile, the mean block time for bitcoin, which measures the length of time it takes to create a new block, has fallen back to 16 minutes, after it surged to 23 minutes on Sunday, the highest level since 2010, according to Glassnode.Though block time fluctuates naturally, the rise in block time could be a result of Chinese miners shutting down their current operations, according to several mining sites. As the hash power declines, it takes longer for miners to solve the puzzles and create a new block. Bitcoin, which is designed to have a target block time of 10 minutes, will see its difficulty level reduced when the block times are greater than expected. Several data providers estimate the mining difficulty could plunge by up to 25% at the next reset, likely on July 5, which would be the largest drop in bitcoin’s history. Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The drop snaps a four-quarter winning streak that saw prices chart a sixfold rise to almost $60,000, according to Bitstamp data.The historically strong quarter began on a positive note, with bitcoin rallying to a record $64,801 in the run-up to the Nasdaq debut of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase on April 14. However, momentum stalled in subsequent weeks as retail investors struggled to do the heavy lifting in the wake of selling by large investors.The market, therefore, looked weak and took a beating in mid-May after U.S. electric-car maker Tesla delisted bitcoin as a payments alternative, citing environmental concerns and dashing hopes for widespread corporate adoption. China’s reiteration of the crypto-mining ban and concerns of an early unwinding of stimulus by the Fed amplified the bearish move, pushing prices down to a then four-month low of $30,000.Since then, bitcoin has traded mainly in the range of $30,000 to $40,000, barring a brief drop to $28,600 on June 22. Sentiment has turned quite bearish, as evidenced by directionless trading in the wake of El Salvador’s decision to adopt the cryptocurrency as a legal tender.Moreover, fears of a deeper sell-off persist, according to the so-called options smile – a chart created by plotting implied volatilities against options at various strike prices expiring on the same date. Implied volatility refers to investors’ expectations of price turbulence over a specific period. It is influenced by demand for call and put options.The option smile for short-date and near-dated expiries carries a steep slope at strikes lower than bitcoin’s current price. That’s a sign of relatively higher implied volatility or demand for options at lower strikes than those at higher strikes. In other words, investors are continuing to buy protective puts – contracts that give purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset, in this case bitcoin, at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, doesn’t foresee bulls making a strong comeback anytime soon.“Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase, and we think this can stretch through September,” he said. “Since its peak in April, the institutional interest has waned, and there is lack of liquidity from both corporations and retail buyers.”According to Balani, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to any weakness on the macro front and could drop to the former hurdle-turned-support of $19,666 (December 2017) in case of a broad-based risk aversion.Currently, traditional markets are showing no signs of weakness. Despite the Fed’s recent hawkish talk, the S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark equity index, is on track to end the second quarter 8% higher, a fifth consecutive quarterly gain. Meanwhile, gold, a safe haven, has erased most of its gains to trade just 2% higher for the quarter, according to TradingView data.The situation, however, could change if the U.S. economy continues to accelerate, reviving fears of an early Fed tightening.That said, some observers remain optimistic and are drawing parallels with the price action seen in 2013 when bitcoin crashed from $250 to $45 in April, bringing the bull run to a screeching halt, only to surge to four figures by November.“While I don’t think the bottom is in, the market looks like 2013, and bitcoin could see a mega pump,” John Lilic, ConsenSys alum, Polygon adviser and Dfinity whale, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds’ chief operating officer and co-founder, doesn’t subscribe to the 2013 scenario, saying the current market structure is entirely different. He remains, however, a cautious long-term bull.“From a technical analysis perspective, the second-quarter drop is a pullback,” Dibb said on a WhatsApp chat. “Bitcoin is still in the stage of a parabolic advance.”A breakout of the current range could bring a rally toward $85,000 by March 2022, Dibb said.Also read: Power, Privacy and China’s Digital Currency Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Cryptocurrencies are in a bear market. It’s not a call to be taken lightly. Analysts have already made bear-market calls prematurely on two occasions this year, numbly applying an off-the-shelf rubric (a 20% drop in a market benchmark). In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is the benchmark for the overall market. Bitcoin dominance, its share of the estimated total market value of all cryptocurrencies, is down to the mid-40s, and it still has no analogy in equities. If Apple, the largest company in the S&P at a $2.2 trillion market cap, commanded as large a share of the S&P 500 total market cap as bitcoin does of cryptocurrencies, it would be a $17 trillion company. As a result, all cryptocurrency returns generally have a strong correlation to bitcoin. This column originally appeared in Crypto Long & Short, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter for professional investors.For bitcoin, 20% drops are quite common, on the way to new all-time highs. Earlier this quarter, we identified a simple method for determining whether such a drop (or rise) has ushered in a new market regime: a change of 20% in the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), followed by at least 90 days in which bitcoin does not return to its previous high (or low).The chart above tracks cryptocurrency bull and bear markets across the years, using this methodology. The XBX reached its all-time high on April 14 (UTC): $64,888.99. By April 22, it had fallen by more than 20%, to a low of $50,500. (Since that time, it’s fallen as low as $28,825.76.) As of Sunday, 24 days remain until that 90-day threshold. Predicting that bitcoin won’t recover to $65,000 in the next three weeks doesn’t feel like a particularly bold move. But this is bitcoin. At the time I’m writing this, the XBX is at $33,493.55. Recovering its ATH would be a 93.7% gain. Since XBX’s inception in April 2014, bitcoin has made such a 24-day run not less than 25 times. Here’s why I don’t think this July will make it 26 times, but I do think this bear market will be short-lived.Two alternatives are easing spot market buying pressure right now. Shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest bitcoin fund, have traded at a discount to net asset value since February. That’s unlikely to change because a large raft of shares in the trust approach their lockup expiry this July. GBTC cannot be redeemed, but some investors who might have bought bitcoin in the spot market are likely to take advantage of the discount instead. (Disclosure: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk; GBTC is benchmarked to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.)Beijing’s crackdown on bitcoin mining looks to be more than just government by press release. Miners are shutting down across China, resulting in a flood of unused mining equipment. Bitcoin mining is not for the faint of heart or short of capital, but at some scale it presents investors an opportunity to acquire bitcoin below spot market price. It’s unclear whether idled machines in China will be viable in North American operations or in other growing mining centers. If they are, hosting space may not be available. Nevertheless, some large investors who otherwise might buy and hold are no doubt eyeing increasingly attractive capital-expenditure projections in a mine-and-hold alternative.Evidence points to a retail-driven run-up in April: Volumes in altcoins, including meme currencies like dogecoin, eclipsed that of bitcoin on spot exchanges. Now, retail buying seems exhausted.Meanwhile, barometers of institutional participation, such as volumes on LMAX Digital and open interest in CME bitcoin futures, are not showing signs of institutional buyers rushing to buy the dip and take retail buyers’ place. These tea leaves can be misleading, but the quick takeaway is that nobody is in the driver’s seat right now. Network data bears this out, with active addresses down on both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.A market interregnum may indicate a short-lived bear regime between bull markets. Some network data supports this analysis. Bitcoin doesn’t have true “fundamentals” in the sense that a bitcoin doesn’t represent a claim on cash flows. However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a family of metrics that indicate activity over networks. I wouldn’t be so naive as to apply Metcalfe’s Law (which predicts effect, not value) to the bitcoin price, but network data does provide another layer of insight, especially when combined with market data. The chart above, from Glassnode earlier this week, shows that a growing share of the bitcoin that has moved during recent sell-offs has been “young coins,” i.e., coins that last moved within the past six months. Short-term investors are selling while longer-term hodlers stand pat. As Coin Metrics’ Lucas Nuzzi noted last week, hodlers’ unrealized gains haven’t hit levels that preceded bitcoin’s past major crashes. Conclusion: If, like me, you’re planning on taking a vacation in July, your timing is good. Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin traded lower on Friday as the price struggled near the $35,000 resistance level. The cryptocurrency was trading around $32,000 at press time and is down about 8% over the past 24 hours. Some analysts expect continued weakness into the weekend as a volatile month nears its end. Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:Ongoing concerns about regulatory crackdowns and environmental issues have weighed on bitcoin’s price over the past few months. The technical charts suggest further downside is likely as sellers react to extreme overbought conditions since March. Over the short term, bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase between $30,000 support and $40,000 resistance. Oftentimes, trading ranges can be difficult to navigate for some traders.“Chinese market participants have been massively selling during the past month alongside the Grayscale unlocking schedule leading to more selling pressure,” wrote Elie Le Rest, partner and co-founder of ExoAlpha, a crypto hedge fund, in an email to CoinDesk. Greyscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of Digital Currency Group.“With newcomers in the crypto market seeing their profit and capital getting wiped out by selling waves, newcomers are taking their losses as they can’t stomach this much negative volatility anymore,” wrote Le Rest.Traders are also grappling with the potential for tighter monetary policy in the U.S. this year, which could weigh on risk assets including cryptocurrencies. “Wall Street will have to see a couple more inflation and labor reports before having a better understanding on when the [Federal Reserve] will taper and be poised to raise interest rates,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk.“It seems it will take intensifying inflation pressures to get the dollar rally going and that might pose one of the key risks for cryptocurrencies this summer,” wrote Moya.Despite short-term price swings, institutions are gradually warming to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin trading volumes on the LMAX Digital spot exchange have surged over the past year. Because LMAX Digital “facilitates trades for institutions only and already is among the leading bitcoin spot exchanges, this depicts the current institutionalization of the bitcoin market,” according to a report by Arcane Research and LMAX Digital published on Friday.The report also mentioned that roughly 70% of the 77 institutional investors surveyed by LMAX Digital expect asset managers, funds and banks to be the most significant contributors to trading volume in the next three years. However, several gaps remain, which could slow the pace of widespread institutional adoption. “Access to banking has been particularly highlighted by brokers, while proprietary trading firms and HFT [high frequency trading] firms see access to credit as a big gap. Notably, corporates see a lack of global regulation as a major concern,” according to LMAX Digital.It appears that China’s regulatory crackdown has accelerated the decline in bitcoin’s hashrate over the past month. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on the blockchain.Bitcoin’s mean hashrate has dropped to 104 EH/s, the lowest level since June 2020, according to data from Glassnode. BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform, predicted the target hashrate would be around 105 EH/s at the next difficulty reset, which will likely happen on July 3, while the target hashrate will drop further to 85 EH/s at the subsequent difficulty reset on July 19 or July 20. Chinese miners have been looking for hosting sites for potential migration. “We’re seeing a ton of inbound requests from China-based mining companies that are looking to relocate to North America and are looking to do it urgently,” Dave Perrill, CEO of crypto mining colocation company Compute North, told CoinDesk. Most digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 were lower on Friday. Notable losers as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET): uniswap (UNI) -11.48%the graph (GRT) -11.33%aave (AAVE) – 10.03%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Options expiry has large open interest around $40K.Bitcoin traded higher after holding support around $32,000 on Thursday. Bearish sentiment is starting to wane as buyers fuel a relief rally from Tuesday’s shakeout low of around $29,000. The cryptocurrency is up about 4% over the past 24 hours, but is still down about 8% over the past seven days.Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:As June comes to a close, roughly 69,000 bitcoin is set to expire at a notional value of $2.37 billion, according to data source Genesis Volatility.“Max pain levels are good to keep an eye on going into an options expiration like this,” wrote Greg Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, in an email to CoinDesk. The max pain level for bitcoin implies a rally up to about $40,000, which is also the strike price with the most open interest.At the current price, this will be the second smallest month-end options expiry of the year, compared to a notional value of about $6 billion in March.This month’s options expiry will occur with lower volume and a tight trading range this month, suggesting weak demand from buyers. Ether’s market-capitalization relative to bitcoin is below 40%, according to Skew. A similar situation occurred in 2018, which preceded a period of underperformance in ETH vs. BTC.The chart below shows ETH/BTC declining from resistance over the past month. There is short-term support at the 100-day moving average, although technicals suggest the ratio could see further downside.Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly mainstream, with Citigroup being the latest megabank to roll out crypto services to at least some of its customers. Citigroup’s wealth management division has formed a new unit called Digital Assets Group, which will be helmed by Alex Kriete and Greg Girasole of the bank’s Citi Global Wealth Investments (CGWI) arm. The unit will be “focusing on all aspects of this fast-growing space of blockchain enabled finance,” according to the bank. Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is entering the Japanese market.

Cryptocurrencies were slightly higher on Wednesday as traders grappled with the likelihood of more regulation. Bitcoin is up about 1.9% over the past 24 hours, giving up about half of Tuesday’s relief rally, suggesting that buyers are starting to take profits. “It’s too early to tell if this is ‘the’ bottom or just a temporary floor before more downside. The lack of any upside catalyst (beside some contrarian oversold metrics) remains the biggest hurdle for cryptos to bounce back,” Elie Le Rest, partner and co-founder of crypto hedge fund ExoAlpha, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.Cryptocurrencies:Traditional markets:“Overall we might witness a range market in July with lower tranches $25,000-$35,000,” Le Rest wrote.Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani doesn’t expect bitcoin to break $30,000 support. “Naked shorts have started to enter the market and the risk of sharp rises due to short squeezes is higher,” he wrote in an email.The risk of further regulatory pressure still looms, however.“Private unbacked cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may be hogging the spotlight, but the role of regulators and policymakers as key gatekeepers likely limits their potential to catalyze truly transformational change,” JPMorgan wrote in a research note published on Monday.From a macro perspective, bitcoin’s sell-off has coincided with a broader move away from risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies over the past two months, as shown by the decline in the copper/gold ratio. Support at $30,000 is critical for bitcoin, although resistance is strong at $40,000.Aside from the slight “risk-off” tone over the past few months, the recent decline in negative-yielding debt could be an obstacle for cryptocurrencies.The downtrend in global interest rates has encouraged a search for yield as central banks remain committed to accommodative monetary policies. Those easy money policies have benefitted risk assets such as corporate bonds, emerging market debt and more recently cryptocurrencies.“Any evidence that easy money is ending with a more hawkish stance by central banks will likely be a drag for speculative assets,” Santiago Espinosa, a strategist at MRB Partners, wrote in an email.Bitcoin’s dominance rate, or the top cryptocurrency’s share of the total crypto market, dropped to under 40% in May, which preceded a near 30% price crash. Since then, the dominance rate has stabilized, suggesting that bitcoin is regaining its luster.“The surge of new altcoins diverted some capital away from BTC and spread it out across small-cap assets, many of which later died out,” Coin Metrics wrote in a newsletter published on Tuesday.The chart below shows a proxy of BTC dominance against roughly 100 of the largest altcoins, using the free float version of market capitalization, according to Coin Metrics. An ether put options seller lost $3 million by taking a large bet against a sharp drop in the cryptocurrency and ended up booking a massive loss on Tuesday.The trader likely sold the $2,560 puts during the bull run, expecting a continued rally to last at least until the end of the year and thus a steady drop in the option’s price. However, ether peaked above $4,000 on May 12 and fell to $1,700 on Tuesday. “The market moved just enough to force the trader to take a loss by buying back 5,000 contracts of the December expiry $2,560 put option sold earlier this quarter,” Greg Magadini, CEO of options analytics platform Genesis Volatility, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. The loss underscores that selling options, be it a put or a call, is a strategy better suited to institutions with ample capital supply and high-risk tolerance. All but one digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 ended up in green on Wednesday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET): filecoin (FIL) +10.39% tezos (xtz) +7.66%the graph (GRT) +6.13%Notable losers: aave (AAVE) -2.62%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Ethereum has a more durable footing: creative computation. BTC is up 245% and Ethereum is up 730% over a one-year period. Of course, both are now down a lot over the last month. But the price on its own tells us very little information.The efficient market hypothesis would have us believe that information advantages, like knowing what a blockchain is, or thinking that a network with no transactions is worth less than a network with transactions, get absorbed into markets through arbitrage opportunities. If you have an information edge, no matter how fundamental or obvious or small, you act on that edge and get rewarded through profits over some time period. Therefore, incentives force rational actors to rationalize irrational markets.Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.But let’s not forget that social media and memetics exist, in part, to make machines out of our lizard brains and network them into the limbic system of the internet of attention.The price, then, is not just a cold calculation of truth revealed. Rather, the price is a signal to be politicized, warred over and worshipped. If you can more easily move the sacred number with your heart than with your mind, which would you choose? No need to do math homework. Just join the bannered tribe of the Bitcoin maximalists, Link Marines, XRP Army, Doge army or some other multi-agent Twitter centaur, and tear into anything and everything that stands counter to your narrative.The fact that people dote on price, and do nothing but talk about it – as a flag – is not new. But perhaps the amount of purchasing that is done based on that flag-waving alone is novel with leading cryptocurrencies. Financial rallying cries are now the norm to teach enemies their lesson in financial ruin. Correlations are another data point here. Coin Metrics has a fantastic tool for plotting crypto asset correlations here. We can see correlations across projects starting to converge to the 0.6 to 0.8 range. Assets with very different stories, such as bitcoin, ethereum, Uniswap, Aave, Binance and Yearn are collapsing any difference in performance toward higher and higher correlation.Perhaps that signals a lack of discrimination from institutional actors when they take an asset allocation approach. This would imply putting money into a “sector,” rather than into a project. Thus you would put 10% of your hedge fund into crypto, rather than into particular assets. Then, when there is a need to deleverage or rotate into a different position, you would reduce a portion of your overall allocation, and thereby impact all the sub-component parts. But it’s a bit hard to believe. Being pioneers among their peers, the crypto funds playing in the space are immensely sensitive to risk and market structure. Bitcoin’s status as a store of value has retail actors selling off well-performing but non-core assets to park whatever remains into bitcoin. As the market overall has become bearish, selling off winners to pay off collateral calls or to turn off risk starts making sense. This seems more likely, and also sucks.If you want to be rigorous in thinking about crypto networks, what are the metrics to actually track? Bitcoin and ethereum come with very different stories, and thus what to track is quite different. Bitcoin is digitally scarce, and therefore can be viewed as “hard and sound” money. The hardness refers to how difficult it is to create additional units of the currency. It is backed by its mathematical truth – with supply limited as pre-ordained by code. While the Chinese authorities may attempt to stomp out bitcoin mining like a weed, it does little to change the network’s ability to secure transactions and generate a store of wealth for people who want to do so away from their governments.In this way, Bitcoin is a political tool aimed at sovereigns, meant to strip away their monopolies on wealth. To the extent that a country cannot collect taxes, control its economy through monetary policy and otherwise rule its people economically, that country is not sovereign in the medieval sense. When a decentralized internet nation comes with its own decentralized internet currency, and promises of freedom and happiness, citizens of a country have an easily accessible alternative to the hegemon. We may soon find a better social contract with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) than with a corporation or a nation. Thus the sovereign will use force to enforce the social contract it finds existential.Bitcoiners, however, believe market forces to be inexorable, assuming infinite demand. For example, the “Bitcoin Stock to Flow” pricing model takes the schedule of BTC emissions with its halving events and overlaps it nicely on a logarithmic scale with the BTC price. Thus, the harder it is to generate the next bitcoin, the higher the price of bitcoin will be.But maybe this is also just two exponential charts overlaid on top of each other? Like, you take one number and divide it by two and then you take another number and you multiply it by two, and then you mess around with the vertical axis until your time period matches.Another bit of the puzzle, when you know what supply looks like, is to try to project demand. There are various analytics about which types of accounts are selling (e.g., large of small), institutional inflows and outflows, and other leading indicators to transaction count. This is an attempt to quantify how people feel about the future, and all sorts of alchemy exists in looking at social sentiment.In our opinion, still some of the best charts for understanding the current valuation of bitcoin have been developed by Willy Woo and are available here. The NVT (network value to transactions) cap, which is based on historic money flows relative to network value, suggests bitcoin should be worth over $1 trillion. The value of all coins at the price of their last transaction is $370 billion. The market is floating somewhere in the middle.Note, however, that the main variables in all these models are how bitcoin relates to its own value. It is valuable to the extent people paid for it – the store of value – and at what rate they are performing such activity. And frankly, we can’t tell apart correlation and causation, because by design much of finance is recursive, reflexive and self-similar.It is a breath of fresh air to switch from talking about existential geopolitics and who gets to be the money god – a monarch, a president or a computer program – to talking about creative computation.Once you layer in programmability into blockchains, you are no longer constrained into talking about money. Yes, money is lovely. But it is also a mere derivative of actual things that actual people do. Money does not exist without some work that has gone into the tangible world, and then became abstracted into something else.To us, it is that work that is important. While upgrading the transformation function that saves abstractions to be more modern and free is a gigantic opportunity, can’t we have a digitally native economy first instead of worshipping a golden calf?Paying for your sandwich in BTC or Apple stock is not a digitally native economy. Building software that runs on Ethereum, or another bridged computational blockchain, definitely is.Having open-source, mutualized financial engines that provide the best financial functionality in the world is a worthwhile goal. Fixing the original sin of the internet by rewiring human creativity out of attention-eating advertising monsters and into economic exchange seems like a pretty good goal too. Designing, congealing and governing an emerging metaverse to make the cyber expanse feel grounded and worth inhabiting may be the largest goal of all.To that end, we find it much easier to root in Ethereum’s fundamentals because it welcomes non-canon extensions, whether they are scalability networks like Polygon, Optimism or Arbitrum, or whether they are the myriad decentralized applications extending the financial uses of ETH through trading, lending, investing, insurance, structuring and asset management. The more others build, and the easier it is for them to build and therefore generate economic exchange and transactions, the better off everyone becomes. This is like watching the number of applications grow in Apple’s iOS or the number of merchants connected to Alibaba go through the roof.To believe in the future of the crypto economy, you don’t have to believe in stories about sovereigns, digital or flesh. Rather, you have to believe in stories about the benefits of non-coercive peer-to-peer economic exchange. To that end, instead of swapping out old governments for the internet, the thesis is that you are swapping out the old economy for the internet. This then is our favorite chart, showing how Ethereum’s 1-plus million in daily transactions is now combined with another 7 million daily transactions from Polygon.Or maybe this one, showing 135 million contract calls in May – the song of software running code.As the crypto markets continue to display both (1) pronounced volatility and (2) increased correlation between different asset types, it’s important to articulate the main difference between the motivating purpose of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We do not think crypto prices are telling a useful or clear story, so it is worth considering the fundamentals of what one is betting on to become true.Bitcoin and Ethereum/Web3 are aiming for quite different goals and will take very different paths to get there. Perhaps during some beautiful singularity, they will converge. The Twitter universe will yell at you until you comply to its price narrative, so be vigilant and pay attention to core principles.

As shown in the ChaiNext tether (USDT) OTC index, the value hovered at 99 for the last few weeks in June, which shows a slight discount in trading USDT,” Matthew Lam, an analyst at crypto exchange OKEx, said.“There is little evidence of dip demand. People are still sidelined,” Amber Funds said in a Telegram chat.Bitcoin peaked above $64,000 in mid-April and fell by 35% in May on the back of concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining and renewed regulatory crackdown in China.Last week, the Federal Reserve unexpectedly brought forward the timing of the first interest rate hike to 2023, adding to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency.While bitcoin is down 8% on a 24-hour basis, other major coins like ether, XRP, and cardano are nursing 10%-20% losses. Dogecoin, the joke cryptocurrency, is trading 25% lower.As such, bitcoin’s dominance rate, or the top cryptocurrency’s share in the total market, has hit one-month highs above 47%, per data source TradingView.Matthew Dibb, COO, and co-founder of Stack Funds, foresees a further rise in bitcoin’s dominance rate.“I personally think the best trade right now for crypto (regardless of direction) is long bitcoin dominance or short alternative cryptocurrencies against bitcoin,” Dibb told CoinDesk.“If the market falls, bitcoin should fall less than altcoins (we are seeing that recently),” Dibb said. “If the sentiment recovers, bitcoin will go up more than altcoins.”Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But the market is split on the severity of the renewed crackdown by the Chinese government.The correction is “mostly driven by China FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] again,” Annabelle Huang, partner at Hong Kong-based Amber Group, told CoinDesk. “Hardly news, not that [banks and payment services in China] are really providing services to crypto-related [business] anyway.”Read More: China Says Banks Must Block Crypto Transactions; Market FallsOthers, however, expressed less positive views.“The statement of the central bank of China is relatively mild as mentioned before,” Colin Wu, a crypto journalist based in China tweeted. “But does this mean that the Chinese government’s crackdown is over? We are not sure. Just as no one had predicted that China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining would be so severe.”Notably, prices for the tether and Chinese yuan pair on the over-the-counter (OTC) desks on Huobi and Binance, two of the most popular crypto exchanges among Chinese investors, have plummeted in the past 24 hours as well, according to data from Price Dancing.The drop reflects a reduced demand for tether, a preferred stablecoin by many traders in China, on the OTC desks, as traders and investors in China are possibly selling their crypto holdings and turning them into cash.“Since [China] shut down Sichuan mining operations, some miners had to liquidate their crypto holdings,” Huang said. “Mining ban is going to have a somewhat ongoing effect.”Read More: Sichuan Becomes Latest Chinese Province to Order Bitcoin Miner ShutdownMonday’s price slide has prompted institutional investors to exit bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), resulting in an unusual condition known as “backwardation,” which is when futures trade at a discount to the spot price.JPMorgan, in a recent report, said that such a move on the bitcoin futures market should be seen as a sign of weak demand for bitcoin from institutional investors, who are the primary users on the CME, as CoinDesk reported on June 10.On June 19, the mean of bitcoin’s daily inflow to spot exchanges reached its highest level since the market crash in March 2020, according to blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, meaning that more BTC are available to be sold on exchanges.Ki Young Ju, the chief executive of CryptoQuant, also noticed that bitcoin “whales” have started to sell their large holdings, intensifying the bearish sentiment.Ju and his firm use a so-called whale capitulation index to monitor bitcoin whales’ behaviors. The index number has turned positive, which shows that an increased number of bitcoin whales are sending their coins to exchanges, according to Ju.The number remained positive for an extended period of time during the bear markets of 2018 and 2019.“I hate to say this, but it seems like the $BTC bear market [is] confirmed,” Ju wrote on his website.The alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market was hit harder on Monday, with dogecoin among the most significant losers of the day.At press time, the meme-centered crypto is changing hands at $xx, down XX% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20.Ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also faced a severe daily loss when its price dipped below $2,000, the first time since May 23.“Notably, most major altcoins suffered relatively higher losses in the last 24 hours when compared with bitcoin, and we may, very soon, see a switch from alts to bitcoin in terms of capital flows,” Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights, told CoinDesk.Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all lower Monday.

But the gains were short-lived as risk assets pulled back, with traders focusing on Fed officials’ revised projection for interest rate increases by the end of 2023 – sooner than what was anticipated in March.The Fed also increased estimates of coming inflation to 3% from the 2.2% projection in March, largely due to transitory factors.“The upgraded economic forecasts still support an argument that the Fed could announce a progress-dependent tapering plan at the end of summer, with actual tapering starting in January,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk.Moya expects risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, to see some short-term pressure due to worrisome signs over inflation. Rising prices could result in sooner-than-expected Fed tapering.The S&P 500, gold, copper and platinum prices dropped as U.S. Treasury 10-year yields rose above 1.5%.Traders had more to grapple with than the Fed’s expectations for an earlier interest rate rise. Crypto markets continue to face pressure from regulators, and it’s not just related to China. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have formed a task force to discuss a range of crypto topics, aiming to “engage with regulators and experts to do a deep dive into this poorly understood and minimally regulated industry,” according to U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the House Financial Services Committee.And in South Korea, exchanges have halted trading on certain cryptocurrencies as regulatory pressure mounts. The latest move follows an ongoing regulatory crackdown on crypto trading, which included fines imposed on exchange employees caught trading on their own platforms. Regulatory crackdowns could weigh on crypto prices and keep financial advisors on the sidelines. In fact, more than 90% of independent financial advisers surveyed by Opinium would not recommend investing in crypto or meme stocks. For now, traders continue to make long/short bets; on one side balancing regulatory uncertainty, while on the other being attuned to an accommodative macro backdrop that has rewarded risk assets over the past few years. In the bitcoin options market, hedging costs remain elevated, indicating that fear caused by the May sell-off has not fully dissipated. The chart below represents the three-month bitcoin options premia for put contracts with strikes at 80% of the spot price, based on data provided by Skew. The current hedging level is still higher than the May low, which preceded a near 30% price sell-off. A similar dynamic is seen in the one-week put-call skew, which measures the spread between prices of short-term puts and calls. The put-call skew has drifted from a near 20% high in May but remains elevated relative to prior months. Options data suggests traders are not overly complacent given the lack of a decisive price breakout from a month-long range.The Bitcoin hashrate – the total computational power used to secure transactions on the blockchain – has dropped to its lowest level since November, possibly a reflection of China’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency mining amid concerns over the network’s energy consumption.The seven-day average hashrate slid to 129.1 million exahashes per second on Tuesday, well off the all-time high of 180.6 million exahashes per second in mid-May, according to data from Glassnode. It’s still up from 105.6 million a year ago.However, some analysts predict the drop in the Bitcoin hashrate will be reversed eventually, as some miners leave China for other locales.“Zooming out, the size and rate of the latest decrease is consistent with other previous drops,” wrote Zack Voell, content director at Compass Mining. “After machines shuffle around the map and hashpower relocates to new regions, the steady growth of Bitcoin’s hashrate should resume.”Almost all digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 ended up lower on Wednesday. Notable losers as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET): nucypher (NU) -6.26% chainlink (LINK) – 5.18% yearn finance (YFI) -5.09%Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Some 81% of fund managers believe bitcoin is in a bubble, even after May’s 35% price crash, according to the latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager survey.The results for the period June 4-10 are up six percentage points from last month’s data, indicating sentiment on Wall Street has turned more bearish. The skepticism among the 224 fund managers surveyed comes despite fresh signs of institutional interest in bitcoin from hedge funds and banks including Wells Fargo. The survey showed 72% of the fund managers surveyed think the recent uptick in inflation is transitory. Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, and many crypto analysts attribute the cryptocurrency’s gains over the past year to concern about increasing inflation. So the Bank of America survey might be suggesting those concerns have abated somewhat.Read more: 3 Things to Watch for Before Calling a Bitcoin BottomThe survey also found fund managers no longer see bullish bitcoin bets as the “most crowded trade” on Wall Street. “Long commodities” ranked as the most crowded trade, displacing “long bitcoin,” which held the top spot in recent monthly surveys. While bitcoin’s price remains relatively stagnant after the May crash, the price of commodities like oil and iron ore has been climbing.

Goldman Sachs’s consumer and wealth management division has concluded that cryptocurrencies are “not a viable investment” for diversified portfolios in a new report for its clients.The assessment is at apparent odds with Goldman Sachs’ disclosure in March that it would be offering crypto to its private wealth management clients.It’s also worth noting that Goldman’s consumer and investment management division argued in May 2020 that cryptocurrencies were “not an asset class.” According to that presentation, bitcoin was “not a suitable investment for our clients,” merely a beneficiary of a “mania” worse than the infamous run on Dutch tulips in the 1600s. At the time, bitcoin was trading at about $9,200. The price has since increased fourfold, to about $40,200 as of press time.

The price was above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bullish signal for market technicians. The price of bitcoin climbed from $36,038 at 01:30 UTC (9:30 p.m. ET Thursday) to $37,536 by 11:45 UTC (7:45 a.m. ET) Friday, a 4.1% gain on some rocky trading patterns, based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then lost a bit and is at $37,275 as of press time.A 4% price ride for bitcoin Friday is actually relatively stable for the asset, which can often see double-digit gyrations on weekdays. Constantin Kogan, a crypto investor and founder of investment community BullPerks, believes the recent mix of news developments is leaving traders without a true market direction.“Speculators are fighting,” Kogan said. “China pulls the market down but the rest of the world is actually bringing more positive sentiment.” Concerns from China, including Asia-centric Binance losing USD access via Silvergate Bank’s network, are getting offset by El Salvador’s adoption of crypto, described by a Bank of International Settlements official  as an “interesting experiment.”Over the past month, there were 18 days where ether’s daily trading volume surpassed bitcoin’s. However, on Wednesday and Thursday this week, BTC returned to the top. On Thursday, bitcoin’s trading volume was at $43 billion total on spot exchanges, 26% higher than ether’s $33 billion. David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at brokerage TradeStation Group, says it’s hard for the crypto market to ignore bitcoin as the long-term bellwether. “Investors putting the marginal dollars to work are favoring bitcoin,” Russell said. “Additionally, altcoins like ether typically perform best after bitcoin has rallied. Strength in crypto often focuses on the biggest name.“ Read More: BlockFi Retail Account Balance Increased Fivefold in Past Year, CEO SaysEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,397 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), losing 1.8% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bearish indicator for market technicians. Ether slipped from $2,492 at 23:00 UTC (7:00 p.m. ET) Thursday to $2,377 by 16:40 UTC (12:40 p.m. ET) Friday, a 4.6% up-and-down pattern, based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has trended upward a bit, at $2,397 as of press time.  Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of options data analytics firm Genesis Volatility, has noticed a change in the derivatives market that may mean ether and bitcoin will see downside or sideways conditions in the short term. “In the past 72 hours we’ve seen huge drops in implied volatility for both BTC and ETH,” Magadini noted. Indeed, Genesis’s “Shadow Term Structure” chart, which shows the path of implied volatility based on future strikes, is dropping the further away the date. Implied volatility is a market’s forecast of a likely movement in a security’s price. “It means that the options markets are expecting rangebound crypto prices for a while,” Magadini said. “We can expect this lull in activity to hold until we trade out of $30,000-$40,000 for bitcoin, and $2,000-$3,000 for ether.”After exceeding $12 billion in trading volume on decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, May 19, the amount of crypto changing hands on these venues fell to below $2 billion by June 6. DEXs utilize the Ethereum network to conduct transactions.Ether remains well off the record price of $4,382.73 reached May 11, according to CoinDesk 20 data. “Bitcoin has had some positive catalysts this week, like the El Salvador decision [to make bitcoin legal tender] and Jack Dorsey suggesting Twitter may support the Lightning Network,” said TradeStation’s Russell. “Nothing as dramatic has materialized for ethereum, which was already trading near long-term highs versus bitcoin.”Exhaustion for ETH and refocus on BTC may be one symptom for declining DEX volumes because that market is focused on ether and altcoins, noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quant firm ExoAlpha. “It’s a return to the mean of ETH/BTC after a bullish phase,” Le Rest told CoinDesk. “If BTC resumes its bull run by breaking $40,000 it could also continue to power the growth of ETH and fill up volume to reach new highs.”Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly lower Friday.

Bitcoin trading volumes have tumbled this month by 47% from May’s record level, in a bleak turn of events for the digital-asset industry as cryptocurrency prices retreat. A daily average of $34.8 billion of bitcoin has changed hands in the first eight days of June, compared with the unprecedented $67 billion charted last month, based on data from CoinDesk Research. The June average so far is the lowest for any month since December. “Traders have certainly lost the appetite for bitcoin in this uncertain market environment,” the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a report. The drop in trading volumes could have implications for cryptocurrency exchanges, which derive revenue from handling the transactions. The big U.S. exchange Coinbase’s stock price is down by 31% since it listed on April 14. “The big price crash in May and Elon Musk’s tweets really drove trading activity, making May a high-comp month,” said John Todaro, vice president of crypto asset and blockchain research at Needham & Company, referring to the CEO of Tesla. Since the transaction volume is quoted in dollars rather than the number of BTC, the past month’s price drop by itself was a contributing factor, in addition to any waning in interest on the part of traders.  Todaro said the cryptocurrency will likely pick back up, and that June could end up coming in line with previous months like March and April in terms of trading activity. On Wednesday, the price of bitcoin jumped the most in two weeks. The cryptocurrency was changing hands near $36,500 at press time, up from $31,000 where it traded late Tuesday.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin volumes and volatility are still lower than ether’s but Ethereum-based opportunities have analysts optimistic for the future.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday by 7.6% as of press time. The price was above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians. BTC fell from $35,614 at 20:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET) Monday to $31,277 by 18:30 UTC (11:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday, a 12% drop based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then regained some of those losses, at $32,938 as of press time.Continued concerns about the regulatory regime for crypto in China were among the reasons for many investors to turn bearish on bitcoin. Some traders are also worried about the possibility of tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which might put downward pressure on risky assets, including cryptocurrencies. As the price of BTC fell over the past 24 hours the trading volume rose, reaching $2.9 billion as of press time on Tuesday, the most since May 28. For 2021 so far, daily averages have been at a much loftier level, around $4.9 billion, based on spot markets tracked by the CoinDesk 20.“Bitcoin has found its footing since becoming oversold from an intermediate-term perspective within its long-term uptrend,” said technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. “As it stands, we would look for bitcoin to establish a lower high versus April without damaging the long-term uptrend.”Read More: Exchanges See Biggest Bitcoin Outflow in 7 Months.

ETH has climbed a bit since, at $2,502 as of press time.  “Ether’s short-term momentum has improved with the rebound, but intermediate-term momentum has deteriorated, supporting a lower high versus the May peak near $4,380,” noted Fairlead’s Stockton. Ether’s momentum, in the form of volume, continues to beat bitcoin’s. For 10 straight days , the number of ETH changing hands has exceeded BTC volumes. Analysts are beginning to think this may be a longer-term trend, especially considering how much higher bitcoin volumes had been for most of the year.Constantine Kogan, a crypto investor and founder of investment community BullPerks, thinks ether’s upstart rise in 2021 as an institutional asset is just beginning. “Long term, I think Ethereum will grow, as proof-of-stake is proving to be a more scalable consensus mechanism,” Kogan said of the blockchain. “Price action right now has been stronger for ETH than for BTC, and it’s shown up in the BTC/ETH correlation as well as in the derivative markets,” added Nathan Cox, chief investment officer of crypto fund Two Prime. Read More: Ether Price Indicator Turns Bearish for First Time Since OctoberIn the ether options market, strikes below the $2,560 price level are heavily favoring puts because traders are preparing for any possible scenario, including over 64,000 ETH total open interest at the ludicrously low $400 strike. “The recent volatility has left traders a little spooked and willing to pay up for downside protection,” said Two Prime’s Cox. “But volatility levels all around have basically collapsed at this point, with BTC [volume] trading back to the low end of the range.”Indeed, after jumping to over 170% in 30-day annualized volatility in late May, ETH’s price gyrations are declining, to 162% as of Monday, based on the most recent data from CoinDesk Research. Also, bitcoin’s price volatility has flattened as of late, to 89%.“I expect some rangebound trading from here as new hands are hesitant to commit new capital, and long-term HODLers are deciding if this is the right price to continue accumulating,” said Cox. “Short term, I think you see ETH continue to outperform.”The total crypto market cap declined on Tuesday by over 7%, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. In the market for alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, Fairlead’s Stockton sees a mostly flat-to-bullish outlook for the week ahead. “Most cryptocurrencies have crossed bullish thresholds versus bitcoin, excluding stellar and cardano, which have neutral relative strength outlooks, and tether, which should remain out of favor while the oversold bounce persists in the space,” noted Stockton. “The cryptocurrencies pointing up and to the right should outperform, whereas downturns in uniswap and chainlink suggest they may lag.”Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all down Tuesday.

With the price of bitcoin off almost 50% from its all-time high, bullish traders are hanging their hopes on a fresh data point that might show the market is nearing a bottom: a big surge in outflows of the cryptocurrency from exchanges.While it’s too early to tell if the outflows will be sustained, the data might indicate that some traders are satisfied with the current price and have no intention of liquidating their bitcoin (BTC) on the exchanges. In the logic of cryptocurrency markets, the traders might be moving their coins to wallets, custody or cold storage while awaiting the price of bitcoin to rebound.    Crypto exchanges registered a net outflow of 22,550 BTC on Monday, the biggest single-day net drain since Nov. 2, 2020, according to data provider Glassnode. The blockchain analytics firm tracks flow from 13 bit cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. “The outflow can best be described as multifaceted, bordering on HODLing, and the use of the digital currency in decentralized finance,” Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at the global payment network Mercuryo, told CoinDesk. To “HODL” is crypto-market slang for buy and hold.The number of bitcoins held in exchange wallets fell to a three-week low of 2.54 million from 2.56 million.Investors typically move coins from exchanges to wallets, taking out liquid supply from the market when they intend to buy and hold in anticipation of price rallies. “Investors appear to be storing their assets in hardware wallets with anticipation that the current drop in price will balance out for new price runs toward and above its previous all-time high,” Kozyakov added.Some investors take direct custody of bitcoin and tokenize the coins on the Ethereum blockchain to earn extra yield. Tokenization refers to locking up bitcoin on Ethereum and issuing an equivalent number of tokens tied to bitcoin’s price. The tokens can then be deposited in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocols.“With bitcoin in DeFi, investors get to maximize their earnings amidst dwindling prices, a better option for many who prefer not to keep their assets idle,” Kozyakov said. Data from the website DeFi Pulse shows total bitcoin locked in smart contracts has grown from 94,000 in April to about 174,000 now.Such tokenization of bitcoin on other networks is also a source for the reduction of supply in the market.All things considered, the latest outflow of bitcoin from centralized exchange paints a bullish picture. However, Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, called for a cautious approach.“The market is currently lacking direction, sentiment is mixed, and many metrics are reporting lower demand, so this traditionally bullish signal should be interpreted with caution and in the context of other indicators,” Deane said.Bitcoin is currently trading near $33,000, representing a 1% drop on the day. The price fell by 35% in May on environmental concerns and China’s regulatory crackdown.While exchange outflows have picked up, demand from “whale” entities – those with sizable holdings whose actions can theoretically move the market – remains muted at best. While the supply held by entities holding 1,000 to 10,000 coins has increased by 35,000 BTC to 4.183 million this month, the tally remains below the May 24 high of 4.186 million.A sustained increase in supply held by whale entities may be needed to restore the battered market confidence. The balance held by these large investors rose in tandem with the price throughout the bull run from October 2020 to April 2021.Also read: Ether Price Indicator Turns Bearish for First Time Since OctoberSign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Chart analysts consider a move below zero to signify a bearish shift in momentum and a move into positive territory as a bullish reversal signal.Not only has the MACD dropped below zero, it is also now at the most negative since September 2018, implying the strongest bearish bias in nearly three years.The weekly MACD for bitcoin turned bearish in the second half of April, signaling scope for a sell-off. Back then, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value was trading above $50,000. Prices fell by 35% in May, hitting lows near $30,000.Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was trading near $2,500 at press time, representing a 3% drop on the day and a 9% decline on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk 20 data.The latest drop follows repeated bull failures at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) hurdle in the past two weeks. The 50-day SMA currently resides just above $2,900.Also read: Bitcoin Suffers Steepest Drop in 10 Days as US Monetary Policy Causes ‘Short-Term Jitters’“Intermediate-term momentum has deteriorated, supporting a lower high versus the May peak near $4,380,” Stockton said, adding that immediate support is located at $2,038, under which the focus would shift to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement near $1,730.“We would not rule out a retest of the 61.8% retracement level,” Stockton wrote. “As long as the 61.8% retracement level is intact, so is the long-term uptrend behind ether, which remains supported by the monthly MACD.”Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

2021-08-04,"  Gary Gensler fuels a BTC price rebound Wednesday, but unclaimed moving averages are causing a headache for traders on longer timeframes. Bitcoin (BTC) hit 24-hour highs later on Wednesday as fresh comments from the United States regulatory sphere boosted flagging price action.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed local highs above $39,000 on Bitstamp, with BTC/USD jumping more than 2% in an hour.The move, which ended a descending channel in place overnight, followed a mainstream media appearance by Gary Gensler, the new Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.A seasoned lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on cryptocurrency, among other topics, Gensler had been welcomed by the industry as a potential catalyst toward favorable regulation by Washington.A speech Tuesday had gone some way to reassuring markets, while Wednesday’s CNBC stint reinforced Gensler’s desire to iron out fraud while allowing investors access to what he called “speculative” assets — Bitcoin and altcoins.“This innovation — Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation — if it is going to meet its potential, needs to come within public policy frameworks,” he told the network, notably singling out Bitcoin in particular over other cryptocurrencies.Gensler’s comments had been a potential source of concern for traders as the week began, this due at a timely juncture, as Bitcoin was already coming down from a rapid ascent to multi-week highs above $42,500.Solid support remained at $36,000 on major exchange Binance on the day — this level yet to see a true test after Wednesday’s sudden turnaround.Nonetheless, it was clear that price action on the day was attracting attention.Related: 3 reasons why Bitcoin can suddenly explode to a new $50K–$65K rangeFor trader and analyst Rekt Capital, potential strength here could allay fears that Bitcoin will end up flipping its 200-day exponential moving average to resistance for the long term.The 200EMA, currently at around $38,300, lay below spot price after the Gensler episode.If this recent #BTC bounce is merely a relief rally to flip the 200-day EMA back into resistance...Then $BTC could pullback towards the blue 50-day EMAThe 50 DEMA is another EMA that has historically proven to be useful in supporting Bull Market uptrends#Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/AWwP5jomvvIn comments to Cointelegraph, fellow analyst Filbfilb added that Bitcoin had also yet to reclaim the 100-day and 20-week moving averages.“This is my biggest concern,” he warned."
2021-08-04,"  Traders identify $40,000 as the pivotal level Bitcoin price needs to trade above in order to avoid a revisit of July’s swing low.  Optimism from bulls is the leading sentiment of the day after Bitcoin’s (BTC) price made its way back toward the psychologically important $40,000 level. In addition to the reversal from this week’s local low at $37,500, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, issued positive comments about the crypto industry and reaffirmed the goal of ironing out fraud in the ecosystem. Now that Bitcoin’s price appears to be back on the path to $40,000, here’s what analysts and traders are saying about the top cryptocurrency. To many traders, $40,000 is a pivotal level for Bitcoin, and how the price performs from here could determine whether the market enters another bullish phase or simply rejects to retest underlying support levels again.As pointed out by the pseudonymous crypto Twitter analyst Rekt Capital, the $40,000 price target is close to the 200-EMA, and it is crucial that Bitcoin secures a few closes above this moving average.If this recent #BTC bounce is merely a relief rally to flip the 200-day EMA back into resistance...Then $BTC could pullback towards the blue 50-day EMAThe 50 DEMA is another EMA that has historically proven to be useful in supporting Bull Market uptrends#Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/AWwP5jomvvShould Bitcoin fail to hold this level, the 50-day EMA at $26,723 could provide the next support zone. Failure to hold above this level increases the possibility that BTC could drift back toward its July lows.Rekt Captial said:The importance of a strong BTC close above $40,000 was also highlighted by pseudonymous Twitter analyst Fomocap, who posted the following tweet that identifies the $40,400 price point as a key area to watch. According to Fomocap, Bitcoin needs to close above $40,400 in order to solidify the uptrend, and rejection at this level opens the door to a revisit of the $30,000 range.Based on the chart provided, the next levels of support below $37,000 are found at $34,300 and $32,000.

2021-08-04,"  Bitcoin is in wait-and-see mode as the dollar trades near two-month lows on warnings that the Fed could continue its stimulus programs.  A recent run-down in the United States Dollar Index (DXY) stopped midway as investors awaited U.S. job data for a guide on the viewpoint for interest rates. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) moved inversely to the greenback.The DXY rose to its intraday high of 92.195 on Wednesday, up 0.45% from its Friday low of 91.782. The move upside took the index back above its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the pink tide in the chart below), at 92.001.The wave was instrumental in protecting the index from aggressive declines in June, serving as support. Meanwhile, a break above the 200-day EMA also prompted traders to test the DXY’s descending trendline resistance. Since then, the DXY has been fluctuating between the two levels.The descending trendline is a part of an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern, as Cointelegraph reported mid-July. As illustrated in the chart above, the setup projects the DXY at or above 97 following a successful upside breakout.Analysts interpret inverse head and shoulders as bullish patterns. In detail, they appear when the price forms three troughs in a row, with the middle one (head) larger than the other two (shoulders). Meanwhile, the troughs hang by a price ceiling, known as the neckline.A successful breakout above the neckline tends to shift the profit target at a distance equal to the gap between the neckline and the head’s bottom. With the DXY checking all the boxes so far, it appears to be looking for a breakout move toward 97.The latest bounce in the U.S. dollar’s value appeared ahead of key U.S. jobs data.In detail, the DXY has lost some ground against rival fiat currencies in the past two weeks. That is due to warnings from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The central banker said last week, after concluding the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, that the Fed might need to keep its stimulus programs in place because of uncertainties in the jobs market.The tone of the incoming ADP employment survey on Wednesday, therefore, seems critical. First, the docket offers a preview of the private sector’s job growth. It expects to show that the U.S. economy has added about 695,000 jobs in July, around 0.43% higher than June. If the prediction is accurate, it may prompt the Fed to pursue tapering earlier than anticipated, which could boost the dollar’s value, as noted in the Institute for Supply Management survey earlier this week.The ADP report will follow up with the non-farm payroll data on Friday.Bitcoin (BTC) closed in the red for the fourth day in a row on Tuesday as investors preferred to stay on the sidelines against a bouncing dollar and ahead of the aforementioned U.S. jobs data.On Wednesday, the BTC/USD exchange rate reached a seven-day low of $37,509, down 1.11% intraday and 11.96% from its session top of $42,605. The pair’s drop appeared as regulators attempted to increase their scrutiny on the crypto sector as a whole. That included U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s request to Congress that lawmakers grant his agency “additional powers” to protect investors from the “Wild West” crypto markets.“There’s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work,” Gensler said at the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday.

On-chain data researcher Willy Woo projected the benchmark crypto at $50,000–$65,000 in the coming sessions, noting that all investor cohorts — big and small — have been accumulating it during the recent drop. Excerpts from his newsletter:Additionally, Anthony Pompliano of Pomp Investments matched the bullish undertones of Woo’s analysis, noting that Bitcoin’s “sound money principles” against the Fed’s pro-inflation monetary policies have made it a better hedge than gold among tech-savvy investors.“It is too early to state the narrative to be dead factually, but one of my outlier expectations for the 2020s is that gold’s market cap will materially shrink as investors leave the analog store of value for the digital version,” wrote Pompliano in a note to clients.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-08-04,"  Optimism is still rampant despite intraday losses accelerating on BTC/USD, which is targeting giant buyer support at $36,000. Bitcoin (BTC) returned to hit local lows of $37,500 on Wednesday in a fresh installment of its comedown from above $42,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD repeatedly challenging then briefly breaking through the $37,500 mark Wednesday.As the market digested comments from Gary Gensler, the new Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, BTC price action continued to retrace progress from the previous week.As Cointelegraph reported, traders were keenly eyeing $36,000 as important support, a showdown with which BTC/USD has yet to begin.“So far so good for Bitcoin,” Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe summarized on the day. A look at orderbook data from major exchange Binance highlighted the veracity of support at the target level, with sellers still lined up at $41,000 and above.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $37,650 after a modest reactionary bounce higher.Fellow trader Rekt Capital also remained optimistic, forecasting an increasingly anticipated “golden cross” event on BTC/USD as soon as the end of the month. Related: Betting on tax bill FUD: 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekA golden cross, the counterpart to the “death cross,” involved the rising 50-day moving average price crossing above the 200-day moving average. The latest price increase, while partially reversed, has nonetheless managed to push such a scenario forward after the death cross in June.“BTC has enjoyed such a recovery that the two Death Cross EMAs have began to flick upwards,” he noted Tuesday. Meanwhile, in terms of market sentiment, interest in higher price levels was firm throughout the week despite the retracement. Strong on-chain data combined with conspicuous, albeit unknown, buying activity to buoy bulls further."
2021-08-03,"  VGX, LUNA and PERP saw double-digit gains even as Bitcoin’s momentum slumped and bulls fought to hold the $38,000 level. Last week's momentum in Bitcoin (BTC) has all but faded as its price is once again below the $39,000 level, with bears and bulls locked in a heated battle for market dominance. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that while Bitcoin price faltered, several altcoins like Voyager Token (VGX), Perpetual Protocol (PERP) and Terra (LUNA) saw double-digit gains.The top performer over the past 24 hours has been Voyager Token, the native asset of cryptocurrency brokerage platform Voyager, which offers retail and institutional investors a secure place to purchase, trade and lend crypto assets. VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for VGX on July 31, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points, including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen on the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for VGX climbed to a high of 75 on July 31, around 50 hours before the price increased 54% over the next day. The sudden surge in momentum for VGX followed Voyager's acquisition of Coinify, a crypto trading platform, and the launch of the VGX web swap 2.0 and staking portal.Perpetual Protocol, a decentralized perpetual contracts protocol that includes an on-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) and up to 10x leverage, was the second-best performer of the past 24 hours.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for PERP have been favorable for some time.As seen on the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for PERP began to pick up on June 29 and climbed to a high of 80 on July 31, around 48 hours before the price increased 30% over the next day.The increase in price, as well as trading volume, comes on the heels of the release of Curie, the v2 upgrade of Perpetual Protocol, which “dramatically improves capital efficiency and increases fee capture for liquidity providers.”Related: Bitcoin price dips below $38K, with bullish traders eyeing a new higher low nextThe third top-performer of Aug. 3 is Terra, a protocol that specializes in fiat-pegged stablecoins, like TerraUSD (UST), to power a price-stable global payment system.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of LUNA has rallied 28% from a low of $11.13 on Aug. 2 to an intraday high at $14.21 on Aug. 3 as its 24-hour trading volume increased by 58% to $714 million. Excitement for LUNA has been building since last week, following the addition of TerraUSD to DinoSwap, and has continued on Aug. 3, thanks to an ongoing community vote to whitelist bETH as collateral on Anchor Protocol, which will bring Ether (ETH) staking rewards to the Anchor ecosystem.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-08-03,"  The rise of the BTCD index could be a sign of the start of another bull run as Bitcoin price attempts to hold on to $38,000. Bitcoin’s price has been rallying in tandem with altcoins, sending mentions of the markets flipping back to a bullish supercycle for Bitcoin (BTC). The flagship cryptocurrency went through the resistance levels of $42,000 for the first time since May 19, hitting a peak of $42,541 on July 31. Alongside the market rally, the Bitcoin dominance (BTCD) index has been seeing an uptrend as well. As per data from TradingView, BTCD hit a 3 month high of 49.2% on July 31. The last time it was at these levels was back in May when it was on the decline from the yearly high of 73.6% it hit at the start of January.The BTCD index is calculated using the ratio of the Bitcoin market versus the rest of the cryptocurrency market. As the name suggests, being the flagship crypto asset indicates the dominance that Bitcoin has over the rest of cryptocurrency tokens. Speaking with Cointelegraph about the market rally being led by Bitcoin, Pete Humiston, manager at Kraken Intelligence, the research division of Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, stated: “Because altcoins felt the brunt of the sell-off over the past few months and because BTC is crypto's ‘safe haven’ asset, a rally in dominance indicates that market participants are reluctant to rotate back into altcoins.”It’s also important to note that the last time the BTCD index was at these levels, it was on its way down from a high in January amid the full-blown bull market. Whereas it is currently on the uptrend from the lows it hit in mid-May. Back in May, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) were outperforming BTC which led to the dominance dropping below 40%. This time around, however, BTC has been making gradual price gains that not all altcoins have been able to match, thus leading to the rising BTC dominance.In addition to the market capitalization being significantly larger than the rest of the crypto assets, keeping stablecoins aside, Bitcoin is the most highly traded crypto-token in a 24-hour period with Ethereum being a close second. However, stablecoins are known to impact Bitcoin dominance as well due to huge influxes in that market. A prime example of this was back in April when a $3 billion USD Coin (USDC) influx led to the Bitcoin dominance hitting its lowest since August 2018.Humiston further spoke on what the market conditions would need to be like to sustain the ongoing uptrend in the index, saying that, “Until it's clear as day that we're entering back into a bull market uptrend, we can expect folks to remain relatively risk-averse, altcoins to underperform and BTC dominance to trend higher.”JPMorgan’s global market strategist, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, recently mentioned in an interview with CNBC that if the Bitcoin dominance goes past 50%, it could be an indicator of whether the “bear phase is over or not” for the cryptocurrency markets. However, as seen in the bull run starting in late 2020 and even in 2018, the BTC dominance usually rises at the beginning of recovery after a slump and drops during euphoric phases of the market. Usually, this period of euphoria is followed by a major correction and then the cycle repeats itself. It is also noteworthy that even though BTCD is used as a measure of market sentiment when looked at in purely percentage terms, it’s often not the most reliable indicator. As the cryptocurrency markets mature, it is inevitable that some altcoins will become more resilient to crashes and lead to a decline of Bitcoin dominance.A report from Stack Funds was released in May after BTC dominance dropped to nearly 40%, revealing that the index could bounce back and mark the end of the market slump. Shaun Heng, vice president of growth and operations at CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency ranking and analytics platform, told Cointelegraph:While Bitcoin is often considered to be the safe-haven asset of the cryptocurrency markets, this “sentiment recovery” that Bitcoin is witnessing saw it regain some of what was lost during the start of the summer. ETH has shown 12.1% over the last seven days compared with Bitcoin’s 3.30%.In a recent development, the CEO of Pantera Capital, Dan Morehead, mentioned that the transition of Ethereum to Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) network will help Ether outpace Bitcoin. In addition to ETH’s price rally, the Ethereum network is also soon to undergo a major update. In a benchmark event toward the migration of the blockchain to an entirely proof-of-stake network, on August 4, the highly anticipated London hard fork takes place which adds five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including the EIP-1559.This is a new transaction pricing mechanism that alters the dynamic expansion and contraction of block sizes to improve scalability. This is set to change the way network fees are managed by incentivizing miners for prioritizing transactions.Related: More like ‘shock-to-flow’ — BTC price hits bull trigger as mystery buyers scoop up supplyEven though this is a huge change for the network and is highly anticipated in the community, Humiston mentioned why this might not impact the macro trend of the markets any time soon: “Because the impact of the London hard fork/EIP-1559 will take time to materialize and BTC dictates the macro trend, we don't anticipate August 4 will ignite a new alt season.”He even added that since the hard fork is a high-profile event that is perceived as a long-term tailwind for the token, the event could be a case of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” leading to a short-term weakness for ETH. However, it is also possible that the hard fork could support another rally for ETH. It’s important to recognize that due to the high correlation between the price movements of ETH and BTC, ETH may not rally based on the hard fork development single-handedly and it would need BTC to hold above $40,000 levels for a rally to be possible.Even though Ethereum’s market capitalization is only 18% of the entire crypto market — less than roughly 50% of BTC’s market capitalization — its utilization in the decentralized finance (DeFi) markets often makes it a contender for the top-ranked token by 24h trading values. In fact, early in July, a Goldman Sachs analyst said that Ether could overtake Bitcoin as the most dominant digital currency as it seems to be the one with the “highest real use potential.”However, Heng opined that “There is a high correlation between Bitcoin performance and that of altcoins, even with Ethereum. As Bitcoin value drops, so do the values of altcoins. And Bitcoin's performance in the past is in part what boosted altcoin availability today.”As Bitcoin’s dominance maintains its rebound along with price levels holding above $38,000, the premium cryptocurrency continues to quash the “flippening” narrative that the drop in Bitcoin’s active addresses over two weeks brought back into the spotlight. In addition to MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor pledged to buy more BTC. Even though the firm holds over $400 million in “paper” losses, he said that there is no reason to not hold Bitcoin for 100 years. Related: NFTs are next for enterprise Ethereum, says ConsenSys founder Joe LubinApart from institutional investors like Saylor keeping their faith through the market slump, it appears that even the retail investors have not given in to the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) surrounding the crypto-verse in the recent past. A report from Crypto.com revealed that the number of crypto users worldwide has more than doubled from 100 million in January this year to 220 million in June. Such re-enforced support noticed in the market adds to the positive sentiment often contributing to higher price stability for BTC — a characteristic that is usually expected from mature assets in the financial markets.This ongoing uptrend in Bitcoin dominance could very well be a sign of another bull market season getting triggered. From what was witnessed in the bull run that began in Q4 2020 and lasted until May 2021, the BTC dominance first rose to a yearly high of 73.5% before the rest of the altcoins caught up to its proportional price action, leading to a full-blown bull market. If this trend repeats itself, the crypto community could be in for another market dominated by the bulls, and the rising BTC dominance is the flag bearer for that event."
2021-08-03,"  Analyst Willy Woo highlights three on-chain indicators that track the flow of Bitcoin tokens across wallets, each of which illustrates why the benchmark cryptocurrency could explode higher. A combination of multiple indicators tracking Bitcoin (BTC) on the blockchain could continue the benchmark cryptocurrency’s price rally further into 2021, popular on-chain analyst Willy Woo anticipates.In his recent newsletter, the market researcher wrote that he expects Bitcoin prices to reach the $50,000–$65,000 range in the coming sessions. His comments appeared as BTC/USD reclaimed its three-month high above $42,600 only days after crashing below $30,000, the pair’s psychological support level.“My expectation is similar to BTC at $20k all-time-high in January, where the price is pinned close to the $40k-$42k ceiling over a period of days (2 weeks maximum) wearing down sellers, followed by a faster move to $50k,” said Woo. Bitcoin’s price rallied alongside supportive comments from Tesla’s Elon Musk, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood in July. The cryptocurrency also rose on rumors that global retail giant Amazon would start accepting it as payments, a claim that the company later refuted.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s run-up to $42,600 also came right after United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitted the possibility of interim inflationary shocks during a press conference last Wednesday. In detail, crypto bulls treat Bitcoin as their hedge against rising consumer prices.Related: Bitcoin struggles at $40K after ‘most confusing’ Jerome Powell press conferenceWhat’s noteworthy is that the period of Bitcoin’s price recovery from under $30,000 coincided with an increasing liquid supply shock. Specifically, BTC was taken off exchanges, which, as Woo suggested, was due to strong holders locking them away for long-term investment.“As of today, the Liquid Supply Shock metric is at a level which is consistent with a $55K price level,” the analyst wrote on Sunday, pointing at the high deviation between the available supply and the current Bitcoin prices.China’s ban on cryptocurrency activities in May played a crucial role in sending Bitcoin prices lower this summer. The decision paralyzed the region’s crypto mining industry, which at one point accounted for more than half of the global hash rate.Glassnode reported in June that miners either closed down their rigs to comply with the new law or shifted their operations outside China, thereby incurring additional costs to keep their production running. The data analytics platform also noted that miners would likely liquidate a portion of their Bitcoin holdings to cover additional expenses. But, as it turned out, the miners’ net BTC accumulation trend reversed in May, showcasing capitulation.But as Woo noted, miners resumed Bitcoin accumulation in July. He cited the popular Bitcoin Hash Ribbon metric, which tracks the network’s expansion and loss of hash rate, noting that it was recovering for the first time since the China ban.“Ribbon recovery events spell the end of miners sell-off (which is what they do when they are driven out of business),” wrote Woo. The past week has seen strong buying from whales, added Woo while pointing at Bitcoin’s climb from $29,300 to over $42,600.Whales typically represent entities that hold more than 1,000 BTC in their Bitcoin addresses. While they don’t exclusively impact the market’s directional bias, their buying in unison with relatively small Bitcoin investors points to a strongly bullish scenario.Related: Bitcoin accumulation accelerates among ‘whales’ and ‘fish,’ while BTC rallies to $40KThe analyst noted that all investor cohorts — big or small — have been buying Bitcoin for nine consecutive days — something even he has never witnessed in the cryptocurrency’s lifetime.“The present buying by all cohorts is strongly bullish,” said Woo. “When everyone is buying, who is the seller? The sellers are traders. The coins sold by traders reduce the speculative inventory on spot exchanges.”The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-08-03,"  The hunt to establish firm support higher up the $30,000 channel continues amid confidence that the worst of the longer-term retracement is already over. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly fell below $38,000 on Tuesday as signs of a retracement from range highs continued to flow in.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD tapping $37,960 on Bitstamp before rebounding.Still trading 3.7% lower on the day, the pair had come off local highs above $42,500 on the weekend amid concerns over regulatory moves from the United States this week.As Cointelegraph reported, analysts were already hoping that a correction would take Bitcoin several thousand dollars lower in order to create a pattern of higher lows, from which it could continue its upside.The target zone, lying around $36,000, was now key to hold in order to prevent what trader Pentoshi called “worst case scenarios.”“Deviations wrecking those people who don’t plan for them,” he warned Twitter followers alongside a chart showing key price levels. Exchange levels differed only slightly from that hypothesis on Tuesday, with major support lingering at $35,000 on Binance.Resistance was in place at $41,000, with the range high of $42,500 now of major interest among sellers.Zooming out, meanwhile, fellow trader and analyst Rekt Capital has found sense in longer-term price action, potentially reinforcing $29,000 as a floor.Related: Price analysis 8/2: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, XRP, DOGE, DOT, UNI, BCH, LINKOn a yearly timeframe within four-year cycles, $29,000 has provided support in 2021, placing post-halving behavior firmly in historical context.The #BTC retrace has happenedInstead of occurring in Q1 however, it took place in mid-Q2In any case, $BTC rebounded from a key Four Year Cycle level:• ~$29,000 (black)Essentially, $BTC turned Candle 4 resistance into new Candle 1 support#Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/P700exoAae pic.twitter.com/GxSuMEUjHKOthers had also taken heart from Bitcoin’s July turnaround and monthly close, among them stock-to-flow price model creator PlanB."
2021-08-03,"  Ether has more potential than Bitcoin as a newer cryptocurrency, and the latest EIP-1559 will help the token trade more like a fixed asset, Pantera Capital CEO said. Amid the looming Ethereum London hard fork, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead predicted that the upcoming upgrade would likely help Ether (ETH) outpace Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest cryptocurrency.As a newer cryptocurrency, Ether has more potential than Bitcoin, Morehead said at the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Monday, noting that the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 upgrade will help the digital token to trade more like a fixed asset.One of five EIPs in the Ethereum London upgrade, EIP-1559 is an anticipated update to Ethereum’s existing fee structure, introducing a minimum payment for sending Ethereum transactions and move away from a bidding system that allows miners to prioritize the highest bids. Designed to programmatically adjust fees for users to pay the lowest bid for each block, the EIP-1559 upgrade could potentially make Ether a deflationary asset.“You’ll see a transition of people who want to store wealth, doing it in Ether rather than just Bitcoin,” Morehead predicted, adding that the cryptocurrency’s shift to Ethereum 2.0 will significantly reduce Ether’s mining energy consumption levels compared with the one of Bitcoin. Ethereum’s wide implementation in decentralized finance applications would also help Ether grow bigger than Bitcoin, he said.Despite predicting a brighter future for Ether, Morehead is still optimistic about Bitcoin’s growth in the future. The CEO reportedly predicted that Bitcoin would trade between $80,000 and $90,000 by the end of 2021, rising above $120,000 within a year. Surging mainstream adoption could further drive Bitcoin’s price to as high as $700,000 in the next decade, Morehead noted.Related: Ether price hits 2-week high as London hard fork momentum buildsLaunched in 2015, Ether is the second most valued cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization amounting to $290 billion at the time of writing. Scheduled to take place on Wednesday, the Ethereum London is one of the biggest Ethereum upgrades designed to move its blockchain from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake, meaning that the network would mostly rely on staking instead of mining. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin relies on the PoW consensus algorithm.Morehead is not alone in thinking that Ether could outperform Bitcoin in the future. Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, predicted in late June that Ether could become the “biggest cryptocurrency one day.”"
2021-08-02,"  Bitcoin’s hash rate recovery, steady peer-to-peer markets and the steady volume exhibited by Asia-based exchanges suggest that China’s attempt to ban BTC was ineffective. Bitcoin (BTC) might have suffered its largest coordinated attack over the last couple of months, but in this instance, the investor community did not capitulate. China outright banned mining in most regions after giving BTC miners a two-week notice, and this caused the single largest mining difficulty adjustment after the network hash rate dropped 50%.The market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin was already damaged after Elon Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to the environmental impact of the mining process. It remains unknown whether China’s decision was influenced or related to Musk’s remarks, but undoubtedly those events had a negative effect.A couple of weeks later, on June 16, China blocked cryptocurrency exchanges from web search results. Meanwhile, derivatives exchange Huobi started to restrict leverage trading and blocked new users from China.Finally, on June 21, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) instructed banks to shut down the bank accounts of over-the-counter desks, and even their social networks accounts were banned. OTC desks essentially act as a fiat gateway in the region, so without them, it would be difficult to exchange Bitcoin for stablecoins.As these events unfolded, some analysts were inclined to describe the tactics as nothing other than meaningless FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — but in hindsight, it appears that China launched a very well-planned and executed attack on the Bitcoin network and mining industry.The short-term impact could be considered a moderate success due to the collapse in Bitcoin price and the rising concerns that a 51% hash rate attack could occur.Regarding Bitcoin Mining and China, I would not believe anything you hear. I would not rule out the possibility that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to orchestrate a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network. Stay vigilant.Despite the maneuvers, China's attack ultimately failed, and here are the main reasons why. After peaking at 186 million TH/s on May 12, the Bitcoin network hash rate, an estimate of the total mining power, started to plunge. The first couple of weeks were due to restrictions to coal-powered areas, estimated at 25% of the mining capacity.However, as the ban extended to other regions, the indicator bottomed at 85 million TH/s, its lowest level in two years.As the data above indicates, the Bitcoin network's processing power recovered to 100 million TH/s in less than three weeks. Some miners had successfully moved their equipment to Kazakhstan, while others shifted to Canada and the United StatesEven though the companies involved in crypto transactions have been banned from the country, individuals continued to act as intermediaries — some of these recorded over 10,000 successful peer-to-peer transactions, according to data from the exchange’s own ranking system.Both Huobi and Binance offer a similar marketplace where users can trade multiple cryptocurrencies, including Tether (USDT). After converting their fiat to stablecoin, transacting on a regular or derivatives exchange becomes possible.A complete crackdown on trading from Chinese entities would likely be reflected in the exchanges previously based in the region, like Binance, OKEx and Huobi. However, looking at the recent volume data, there hadn’t been a meaningful impact.Take notice of how the three ""Asia-based"" exchanges remain dominant, while Coinbase, Kraken and Bitfinex are nowhere near their trading activities.China's ban on Bitcoin mining and transactions may have led to some temporary hiccups and a negative impact on BTC price, but both the network and the price have recovered in a way that is better than many expected.Currently, there is no way to measure the OTC transactions where larger blocks are traded, but it is just a matter of time until these intermediaries find new gateways and payment routes.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-08-02,"  Bitcoin price has hit a few barriers, but many altcoins appear positioned for continuation. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped back below $39,000 on Aug. 2, suggesting that short-term traders were booking profits after the price failed to close above $42,451.67. However, lower levels may attract the type of buying seen in late July. Data from Santiment showed that Bitcoin held on wallet addresses storing between 100 and 10,000 Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high at 9.23 million Bitcoin on Aug. 1. The previous all-time high for this group of investors was recorded on April 5, just over a week before Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $64,854 on April 14.Santiment highlighted that the “addresses have accumulated approximately 170,000 more Bitcoin” in the last four weeks. A similar pace of purchase was seen in late December 2020, just before the start of the strong bull move in 2021.CoinShares data showed that the assets under management in Bitcoin-focused funds dropped by $20 million last week, its fourth successive weekly decline. Over the past month, Bitcoin funds have witnessed cumulative outflows of $67.8 million.The data was not all bearish because multi-asset funds attracted cumulative inflows of $7.5 million last week and $11.9 million over the past month.Could Bitcoin break out of its range and lead the crypto markets higher? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin (BTC) peeked above the overhead resistance at $42,451.67 on Aug. 1, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that bears are attempting to keep the range-bound action intact.The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($36,968) and the relative strength index (RSI) above 62 suggest that the sentiment is positive. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push and sustain the price above $42,451.67.If they succeed, it will signal the start of a new uptrend. The first target on the upside will be a move to the overhead resistance zone at $50,000 to $51,500 where bears may yet again mount a stiff resistance.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the $36,670 support. That will indicate that the BTC/USDT pair could extend its consolidation between $28,805 and $42,599 for a few more days.Ether (ETH) broke above the downtrend line on July 31, invalidating the descending triangle pattern. The bears sold at higher levels on Aug. 1, as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick, but the positive sign is that bulls did not allow the price to drop below the downtrend line.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,273) and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls are in control. The ETH/USDT pair could now rally to the psychological level at $3,000 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the price back below the 20-day EMA, it may trap the aggressive bulls. This could result in long liquidation, which may sink the pair to $2,000 and then to the critical support at $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) rose above the overhead resistance at $340 on Aug. 1, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that bears are attempting to defend this level.Although the price dipped back below $340 on Aug. 1, the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. If the price consolidates between the moving averages and $340, it will improve the prospects of a break above $340.If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a target objective at $454.58, but the climb may not be easy because the bears will erect roadblocks at $380 and then again at $433.On the downside, if bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the trendline. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the next stop could be $211.70.Cardano (ADA) rose above the downtrend line on Aug. 1, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that bears are defending the resistance aggressively.The marginally rising 20-day EMA ($1.27) and the RSI above 56 suggest that bulls have a slight advantage. If buyers can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the descending triangle pattern.The ADA/USDT pair could then rise to $1.50 where the bears may again pose a stiff challenge. If buyers can overcome this resistance, the pair could start its journey toward $1.94.This positive view will be negated if the price turns down and plummets below $1.20. That could open the doors for a further slide to $1.14 and then $1.XRP has been consolidating near the overhead resistance at $0.75 for the past few days, which suggests that bulls are not booking profits as they anticipate the relief rally to extend further.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is above 63, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive and sustain the price above $0.75, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern, which has a target objective at $1.If bulls fail to sustain the price above $0.75, short-term traders may close their positions. That could drag the pair down to the moving averages. A break below this support will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the $0.50 to $0.75 range for a few more days.Dogecoin (DOGE) has been consolidating near the overhead resistance at $0.21 for the past few days. This suggests a state of uncertainty among the bulls and bears.The flat 20-day EMA ($0.20) and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. Usually, a tight consolidation near the stiff resistance resolves to the upside. If buyers thrust the price above $0.21 to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.22) resistance zone, the DOGE/USDT pair could rise to $0.28 and then to $0.33.On the contrary, if bulls fail to clear the overhead hurdle, it could attract profit-booking. The pair could then gradually slide down to the critical support at $0.15. A bounce off this level may keep the pair range-bound between $0.15 and $0.21 for some more time.The $16.93 level had acted as a stiff resistance between June 22 to July 8, but the bulls propelled Polkadot (DOT) above it on Aug. 1, which is a positive sign.The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is just below the overbought territory, suggesting that buyers have the upper hand. If bulls flip $16.93 to support, the DOT/USDT pair may continue its journey to $26.50.On the other hand, if the bears pull the price below $16.93, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($15.21), which may act as a support. If the price rebounds off this level, the buyers will again attempt to resume the relief rally. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could result in a retest of $13.The long wick on Uniswap’s (UNI) candlestick on Aug. 1 suggests that bears are defending the overhead resistance at $23.45, but the positive sign is that bulls have not given up much ground.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, indicating that buyers have the upper hand. A break above $23.45 will clear the path for a possible rally to $30. If the price again turns down from the overhead resistance, the UNI/USDT pair is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($19.55). If the price rebounds off this support, it will improve the prospects of a break above $23.45.Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.Related: There’s no reason not to hold Bitcoin for 100 years, Michael Saylor saysBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading between the 50-day SMA ($498) and the overhead resistance at $546.83 for the past four days. A tight consolidation near a stiff resistance suggests that buyers are not closing their positions, as they anticipate a move higher.If bulls sustain the price above $546.83, the BCH/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern. This bullish reversal setup has a target objective at $710.13. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the pair could extend its range-bound action between $383.53 and $546.83 for a few more days.The bulls pushed Chainlink (LINK) above the overhead resistance at $22.07 on July 30, but the bears are not allowing the buyers to have a runaway rally.The bears are attempting to pull the price back below $22.07, but the bulls have held the support for the past three days. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that buyers have the upper hand.If bulls drive the price above $24, the LINK/USDT pair could rise to $26.48. A break above this resistance could clear the path for a possible rally to $32.Alternatively, if the price breaks below $22.07, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($19.17). A strong rebound off this support will suggest that sentiment remains positive, as traders are buying on dips. The bears will have to sink the price below the moving averages to gain the upper hand.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-08-02,"  Calls for a doubled-up Bitcoin price rise as the cryptocurrency paints 10 green candles in a row. While Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has slipped by more than 8.2% after rising to $42,230, the 43.5% rally included 10 consecutive days of gains. But despite BTC currently trading at around $39,700 as of Monda, some analysts anticipate that it can rise by another 100%.Nunya Bizniz, an independent market analyst, posted the bullish setup on Sunday, noting that each of the cryptocurrency’s previous 10-day bull runs has ended up doubling its prices at a later stage. Therefore, if history repeats or rhymes, Bitcoin’s price can go up by more than 100% in the next 30–60 days.Bizniz noted that the next Bitcoin peak could form on Sept. 21, 2021, citing the cryptocurrency’s performances before and after its previous two halving events. The halving is a pre-programmed phenomenon written into Bitcoin’s source code that automatically reduces its new supply rate by half every four years.After the first halving in 2013, it took Bitcoin prices approximately 326 days to establish a new record high. Meanwhile, following the next halving in 2016, Bitcoin rose to a new peak 526 days later. That shifts the date of Bitcoin’s cycle peak to Sept. 21, 2021, coinciding with the 10-day bullish fractal mentioned above and based on its previous halving in May 2020.Short story:A+B= pic.twitter.com/iWwK4IpEtIMeanwhile, Seeking Alpha financial markets contributor Ariel Santos-Alborna noted that the current Bitcoin cycle is more similar to 2013 than 2016. Back then, the BTC/USD exchange rate topped out at $255 in April, bottomed in July at $66, and then rose to a peak of $1,150 in December. Similarly, the pair reached almost $65,000 in April, later plunged to around $29,000 in July, and, as Santos-Alborna believed, was heading for a new peak in the next 2021 fiscal quarter.Related: BTC price sees 6% correction in contrast to booming Bitcoin on-chain dataBut the analyst warned traders against setting up their upside targets based on previous price rallies. For instance, a run-up from $66 to $1,150 in 2013 does not mean Bitcoin will rise from $29,000 to, say, $256,000 in 2021.“Both tops occurred in November and December, respectively, which could insinuate that the trigger for bear markets has more to do with taxes,” explained Santos-Alborna, adding that $88,000–$150,000 is a “more realistic” upside target for Bitcoin in 2021.The statements come at a time when regulators and governments have increased their scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. That includes a recent push by United States lawmakers to impose more taxes on the profits made by cryptocurrency investors. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-08-02,"  Bitcoin price rejection at $42,000 means BTC is now trying to find new high lows, but at what price levels?  Bitcoin (BTC) has seen an impressive rally of 44% with 10 green days in a row. This rally and the substantial number of green days resulted in a sentiment shift. Practically two weeks ago, the market was comparable to a funeral, with many expecting more downside to $20,000. However, the sentiment completely shifted after the breakout above $31,000. The current sentiment is the expectation of Bitcoin to rally to $100,000 or higher in the second part of this year, while on-chain analysts are back on their game, once again. Is Bitcoin going to break upward from here, or will a healthy correction take place? Let’s take a look at the technicals. The weekly chart shows the current range-bound construction for BTC/USD. In this construction, a breakout didn’t happen. Last week, Bitcoin’s price tried to break through the resistance zone but couldn’t force a breakout yet. Therefore, the conclusion is that the market is still unsure about the market direction at this stage. However, the weekly chart also shows apparent support in the zone between $28,000 and $31,000. This level has been tested several times and is still holding up as support despite the extreme bearish euphoria the last time Bitcoin’s price visited that range. Finally, if the market wants more information about the direction, the lower time frames often indicate further clues that should be watched.Bitcoin’s daily chart doesn’t tell us much information, even though the recent rally was a steep staircase of green candles.This rally not only showed the interest in the market but also that the most popular projections are often wrong. Many people anticipated a further crash to $20,000 when Bitcoin’s price was hovering around $30,000. On-chain analysis shows that short-term holders have been selling heavily in that range, anticipating a further correction to be happening, while long-term holders have been accumulating heavily. Thus, the exact opposite of a correction took place. Bitcoin rebounded by 44%, while altcoins have seen gains of 70%–150%. Further, if Bitcoin’s price can’t break further upward above $42,000, a potential higher low scenario can be validated in the region around $36,000 or $33,000. However, a substantial corrective move to $33,000 would be unwelcome if the market is truly bullish, as such a correction would grant an entry position to the latecomers once again. Moreover, a correction to $36,000 would generate a higher low, which would confirm a market trend change. After a higher high, a higher low confirms a trend change and the bullish divergence, making the $36,000 scenario the optimal level for this to happen.The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has seen a devastating and rapid crash by 55%, resulting in a sentiment switch from euphoria to depression. However, looking at the chart, a healthy and beautiful retest has been made at the $1.1-trillion levels. This level wasn’t tested during the entire move-up. Now, it has finally got this retest, resulting in buyers stepping in.This level is comparable to the $28,000–$31,000 region for Bitcoin, which has survived multiple tests. The total market cap of crypto doesn’t seem to be ready for an upward breakout, however, as it’s currently facing a critical resistance zone at $1.75 trillion. The red zone has been showing resistance multiple times, forming a range-bound construction. In that structure, a higher low is needed to confirm a change in trend. In that regard, a higher low at $1.35 trillion would be a good level for bullish continuation. If the total market capitalization breaks above $1.75 trillion, new all-time highs will become likely. The one-hour chart for Bitcoin shows a clear picture of the current market. On the four-hour chart, a bearish divergence is spotted, which will be confirmed if the price of Bitcoin drops beneath $38,500.With the one-hour chart, the price of Bitcoin dropped beneath the support level at $40,800. This drop means a market breakdown has taken place and the subsequent support had to be tested. That next support level can be found at $38,600. The breakdown didn’t have much volume, however, as the actual stops are placed beneath the recent low at $38,500. Therefore, a heavier correction toward $36,500 and $35,000 is on the table if the market breaks down once more. Such a correction would correct the entire market, through which Ether (ETH) could see a drop to $2,300 and $2,000 as well. The crucial levels on the downside are found at $38,500, as well as at $36,500 and $35,000. Finally, the crucial resistance to breaking Bitcoin’s price is found at $40,600–$41,000. If that level breaks, it’s very likely to see a continuation of the rally happening to $48,000, as the price of Bitcoin will take out the recent high at $42,000.However, after such a substantial rally and a fast sentiment switch, a correction is very healthy, especially if Bitcoin can’t break above $40,800 in one go.

2021-08-02,"  Ether risks bearish exposure as ETH’s price rises against falling volumes, but three crucial on-chain indicators suggest a dissenting scenario. Ethereum’s native asset, Ether (ETH), dropped after reclaiming its two-month high in the previous session, suggesting that its recent bullish rally was nearing exhaustion. In detail, the ETH/USD pair topped out at $2,699 on Sunday for the first time since June 7. The pair’s peak level also pushed its relative strength index (RSI), a momentum-gauging indicator, above 70 — a mark that analysts consider overbought. Seemingly, traders with short-term risk setups sold the Ether top to secure interim profits, leading up to a modest downside correction.On Monday, Ether prices rose 1.81% to $2,600 to offset the Sunday sell-off risks. The upswing indicated that traders could still place higher bids for the cryptocurrency, especially in the days leading up to the Ethereum’s London hard fork upgrade that would — for the first time — bring deflationary features to the project’s economy via a new base-fee burning mechanism.Greg Waisman, co-founder and chief operation officer of payment network Mercuryo, noted that Ether’s prices could easily cross above $3,000 after the hard fork, given it would bring a “more flexible and cheaper fee structure” to the Ethereum network, boosting adoption. The analyst told Cointelegraph:#Ethereum has notched a 12-day winning streak, the longest everThe IOMAP indicator reveals that $ETH is sitting on strong support while facing the last 2 key levels of on-chain resistance on its path to $3k once againBetween $2,598 and $2,753, 1.19m addresses bought 2.03m ETH pic.twitter.com/KAP3y0V94iAt least three on-chain indicators tracking Ether flows in and out of dedicated addresses foresee an extending upside setup.Spotted on CryptoQuant, the three metrics involved tracking Ether reserves across all exchanges and their outflow from trading platforms, as well as the volume of ETH tokens being deposited to Ethereum 2.0 smart contract.Related: Traders forecast $3K Ethereum price but derivatives data suggests otherwiseThe CryptoQuant data showed that the total Ether reserves on exchanges declined, indicating that fewer traders are interested in exchanging ETH for other assets. Meanwhile, the ETH outflow from those exchanges spiked, illustrating traders’ intention to hold their Ether around the London hard fork event.Working together with the exchange data, the third on-chain indicator showed a surge in ETH deposits to its smart contract.In detail, users can stake 32 ETH into Ethereum 2.0 smart contracts to become validators on its proof-of-stake blockchain. In doing so, they can expect to received rewards for batching transactions into a new Ethereum block or checking the work of other validators to keep the chain running securely.Analysts see the event as bullish because it removes the active Ether supply from circulation against a potentially rising demand.“The increasing Ethereum 2.0 deposits show a big trust in the future potentials of the Ethereum blockchain, which stirs the scarcity of its native token Ether,” Waisman explained. “The situation may impact positively on the coin’s price.”The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-31,"  Ether's price might be bullish in the short term, but there are a handful of factors that could keep the price pinned in its current range. The price of Ether (ETH) has been in a downward spiral ever since Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin presented at StartmeupHK Festival 2021. In a fireside chat session on May 27, Vitalik stated that several internal team conflicts caused the proof-of-stake migration to delay its launch.As reported by Cointelegraph, ""Phase One,"" which introduces scalability through sharding, has been postponed to 2022. Furthermore, DeFi’s inherently decentralized nature might not be entirely beneficial because the sharding-style processing would need to run transactions through a relay chain.It’s impossible to pinpoint the reason behind Ether’s sharp fall from its all-time high, but the surging gas fees certainly impacted investors’ expectations. Not only did it make evident how limited the network was, but it also incentivized traders to experiment with alternative networks, like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon’s layer-two solution. The chart above shows that the $45 average gas fee took place a whole month after the Berlin upgrade went live on April 15. The consensus in the Ethereum community was that Berlin was less impactful in the short term but paved the way for the awaited London hard fork’s EIP-1559 protocol on Aug. 4.This takes us to one of the three factors that could negatively impact Ether's price in the short term. The Ethereum London hard fork is part of the roadmap to the final Ethereum 2.0 release in 2022. The long-awaited update is scheduled for Aug. 4 but has been delayed already, as the previous schedule mentioned late July.Miners will be the most affected by the EIP-1159 proposal, which aims to burn part of the fees generated on the Ethereum blockchain, hence reducing their revenue. Furthermore, EIP-3554 introduces an incremental difficulty adjustment that incentivizes the migration to the new proof-of-stake blockchain.The delivery track record of Ethereum developers also does not inspire confidence. If a partial upgrade were to take place and the more controversial changes were delayed, Ether's price could slide, as a portion of the current rally is built on the hype surrounding the hard fork.This time around, the main concern isn’t technical but social. Once it becomes clear for Ethereum miners that their revenue source will be gradually cut off, it is a matter of time until some competing network benefits.Even though most smart contract blockchains have been designed for the proof of stake consensus model, some lesser-known projects could change their algorithm to support Ethash mining.Analysts should not discard the possibility that Binance Chain or Solana could implement an additional security layer using the extra hashing power caused by an Ethereum miner exodus. Although this scenario is distant, these movements would undoubtedly put pressure on Ether's price.The longer it takes for Eth2 to be fully implemented and for decentralized applications to upgrade their code to support parallel processing (sharding) capabilities, the higher the incentives for adding multichain support.Curve and Aave, the two leading DeFi protocols by total value locked, have both added support for blockchains other than Ethereum. Meanwhile, Polygon holds $550 million worth of Curve contracts and Aave holds another $1.8 billion, according to data from DeFi Llama.In the end, the most likely “Ethereum killer” is the network itself because postponing the scaling solution would push users and DApps to alternative solutions. At the same time, the migration to PoS opens room to strengthen competing blockchains.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-31,"  Daily chart data shows the strength of the current rally as a longstanding resistance level finally shows signs of falling. Bitcoin (BTC) shot to new highs of $42,400 on July 31 in a surprise attack on a range resistance that sellers failed to squash.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining for a tenth straight day across exchanges, reaching $42,420 on Bitstamp.A subsequent cooling-off preserved most of the gains, with Bitcoin circling $41,900 at the time of writing, still up over 8% over the past 24 hours.In trading circles, talk focused on a rare performance for the Bitcoin daily chart — ten green candles in a row, which last occurred in 2012.Bitcoin has closed 10 straight green daily candles! pic.twitter.com/6FEG4CgqLlEven eight days of consecutive gains are a rarity, while nine have been seen only twice. Depending on the exchange, the data can be slightly different — Coinbase saw 12 green candles one after another in May 2017, one Twitter user noted.Regardless, on one hand, Bitcoin’s strength was conspicuousness; on the other, there was a lack of bearish selling pressure.A glance at short activity on major exchange Bitfinex underscored the current mood, with hardly any trader willing to take on the risk of shorting the Bitcoin spot price at current levels.""BTC just tapped 42k as resistance for the first time since the epic drop in May,"" popular trader Scott Melker summarized on the day. As Cointelegraph reported, $42,000 represents the final resistance hurdle in Bitcoin's multi-month trading range. Since coming down from all-time highs and falling through the level, which also represents the previous all-time from February, it has acted as a de facto unchallenged price ceiling.Related: Price analysis 7/30: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, XRP, DOGE, DOT, UNI, BCH, LTCAbove, orderbook data shows, little lies in Bitcoin's way — $45,000 or even $47,000 could easily be next, a hypothesis also supported by whale investing behavior.According to the popular and historically accurate stock-to-flow Bitcoin price forecasting models, the spot price should still be much higher — $94,839 on Saturday.Nonetheless, its creator, PlanB, has said that a monthly close of at least $47,000 for BTC/USD in August would be enough for progress to remain on track."
2021-07-30,"  Traders expect altcoins to move higher now that Bitcoin price finally pierced the $41,000 resistance.   Bitcoin (BTC) and most major altcoins seem to be faltering near their respective overhead resistance levels. This suggests that some investors are continuing to sell at higher levels.However, 21st Paradigm co-founder Dylan LeClair said that on-chain data shows “big transfer volumes from over-the-counter (OTC) desks over the last week.” Cointelegraph also recently highlighted a historic 57,000 BTC outflow from exchanges on July 28.Ecoinometrics also cited on-chain data to show that ""whales"" and “small fish'' accumulated Bitcoin when the price recovered from $29,400 to over $40,800 this week. Institutional investors are also not to be left behind in their plans to accumulate more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which holds about 105,085 Bitcoin, said in its second-quarter report that the company intends “to deploy additional capital into our digital asset strategy.""Wealthfront, a popular US-based robo-investment firm $25 billion in assets under management, announced that it would allow its clients to allocate up to 10% of their portfolio into Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. With demand increasing from small investors and high-net-worth individuals, will cryptocurrencies stage a sharper recovery? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on July 29, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears near the $40,000 mark. That uncertainty briefly resolved to the downside and if the price does not hold its recent surge above $40,000 the price could drop to $36,670.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If the price rebounds off $36,670, it will suggest that bulls have flipped this level into support.The buyers will then again try to push the price above the overhead resistance zone at $41,330 to $42,451.67. This may not be easy because bears will try to defend this zone aggressively.If the price turns down from the zone, the BTC/USDT pair could remain range-bound between $36,670 and $42,451.67 for a few more days. A breakout and close above $42,451.67 will suggest the start of a new uptrend.The bears will be back in the driver’s seat if they can sink the price back below the moving averages.Ether (ETH) reached the downtrend line today but the bears are defending the resistance aggressively. The price could now drop to $2,200 where buyers may step in and arrest the correction.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting that bulls have the upper hand. If the price rebounds off the 20-day exponential moving average, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the downtrend line.If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could rise to $2,600 and then to $3,000. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move could sink the price to $2,000 and next to $1,728.74.The bulls pushed Binance Coin (BNB) above the 50-day simple moving average ($310) on July 29 but they could not challenge the overhead resistance at $340. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels.The bears will now try to take advantage of the lack of demand to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($305). A break of this support could result in a drop to the trendline and next to the July 20 low at $254.52.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buying on dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to clear the overhead resistance at $340. If they pull it off, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to $379 and next to $400.The failure of the bulls to drive Cardano’s (ADA) price above the 50-day SMA ($1.32) indicates that bears are aggressively defending the resistance.If the price breaks below the 20-day EMA ($1.25), short-term traders may close their positions and that could drag the price down to $1.10 and later to $1. A break below $1 could result in long liquidation.On the other hand, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push the price above the downtrend line. If that happens, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to $1.50 where bears may again mount a stiff resistance.The bulls have failed to push XRP above the $0.75 level for the past two days, which suggests that bears are defending this level aggressively.The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If bulls do not allow the price to break below the 20-day EMA ($0.64), the XRP/USDT pair may rise above $0.75. That will complete a double bottom pattern, clearing the path for a possible rally to $1.07.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below the moving averages. The bears will then try to pull the price to $0.59 and then to $0.50. Such a move will indicate that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.The bears have been defending the $0.21 resistance for the past few days but a minor positive is that bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that buyers are not closing their positions as they anticipate Dogecoin (DOGE) to move up.The flat 20-day EMA ($0.20) and the RSI above 45 suggest a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.23). That may clear the path for a rally to $0.28 and then $0.33.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $0.18, the DOGE/USDT pair may drop to $0.15. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if it gives way, the pair may witness panic selling and drop to $0.10. The bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above the 20-day EMA ($14.15) on July 27 but they have not been able to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($16.05). This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The price has turned down from the 50-day SMA today and the bears will now try to sink the DOT/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $13. A break below this support could sink the pair to $10.37.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance at $16.93. If that happens, it will suggest a change in the short-term trend. The pair could then start its journey to $20 and later to $26.50.The bulls are attempting to push Uniswap (UNI) above the downtrend line but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that bears have other plans.If the price turns down from the current level but stays above the 20-day EMA ($18.50), it will indicate that bulls are buying on dips. That will improve the likelihood of a break above the downtrend line, invalidating the descending triangle pattern.The UNI/USDT pair could then rise to $24 and if this level is crossed, the up-move may reach $30. Conversely, if bears pull the price below the moving averages, the pair may decline to $17.24 and then to the critical support at $13. Related: Who takes gold in the crypto and blockchain Olympics?Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance at $546.83. This suggests that bears are attempting to defend the resistance of the range and extend the consolidation for a few more days.If bears pull the price below the moving averages, the BCH/USDT pair could witness further selling and drop to $441.17. A break below this level will open the doors for a further slide to the critical support at $383.53.On the other hand, if bulls do not allow the price to drop below the moving averages, it will enhance the prospects of a break above $546.83. If that happens, the double bottom pattern will complete and the BCH/USDT pair could start its journey toward the target objective at $710.13.Although bulls pushed Litecoin (LTC) above the 50-day SMA ($137) on July 28, they could not clear the hurdle at the overhead resistance at $146.54. This indicates that bears have not yet given up.If sellers pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($130), the LTC/USDT pair could start its downward journey to the critical support at $103.83. Such a move will indicate that the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $146.54. If they succeed, the pair will complete a double bottom pattern, which has a target objective at $189.25.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-30,"  “This is just on-chain sentiment, though. The big question is, how does that correlate to the price action in general?” Both small and rich Bitcoin (BTC) traders accumulated the benchmark cryptocurrency en masse during the period when its prices rose from below $30,000 to over $40,000, signaling their confidence in the asset’s long-term bullish setup.The basis of the upside outlook came from Ecoinometrics, a crypto-focused newsletter service. It highlighted in its latest edition a flurry of on-chain data that tracked the flow of Bitcoin into wallets that belonged to the richest crypto traders, known as “whales,” and to entities that held the cryptocurrency in smaller quantities — the so-called “small fish.”“After a couple of weeks of data showing that most address buckets are accumulating coins, Bitcoin is finally bouncing back from the $30k level,” wrote Nick, the author of the Ecoinometrics newsletters, as he highlighted a heat map that witnessed Bitcoin flowing into the small fish and whales’ wallets.The color red points to a situation, in which every group — whales or fish — has accumulated Bitcoin in the past 30 days. Conversely, the color blue corresponds to situations wherein only the smaller fish have accumulated the digital asset in the same timeframe.Bitcoin’s heat map has returned to red.“We can do the same plot for the current cycle and we observe pretty much the same thing,” noted Nick while pointing to the July 2020–July 2021 graph as follows.Data from other sources matched the Ecoinometrics’ analogy. For instance, crypto-focused data tracking service WhaleMap reported Thursday that the number of unspent transaction outputs currently belonging to Bitcoin whale wallets has spiked, thereby suggesting their intentions to wait for higher prices.“The last whale bubble in our range,” tweeted WhaleMap. The fundamentals backing whales’ involvement in the current Bitcoin rally pointed to fears of persistently rising inflation despite United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s attempts to sideline the issue in his recent press conference on Wednesday.Powell admitted that inflation has surpassed the Fed’s projections for 2021 but blamed it on the unusual nature of the U.S.’ economic recovery. He noted that supply bottlenecks have created shortages that have led to “temporary” price increases.The comments appeared as the Fed continues its expansionary policy of near-zero interest rates and $120 billion a month in bond purchases that, as the Wall Street Journal editorial noted, could have been stopped two months after its launch in March 2020.The journal cited the National Bureau of Economic Research’s report of last week, which noted that the U.S. recession officially ended in April 2020. “The FED has a real challenge ahead balancing its response to a global pandemic with low rates and seemingly rising inflation,” Jeffery Wang, head of Americas at Amber Group, told Cointelegraph, calling it “an extremely difficult situation” for central banks running their quantitative easing programs.Wang added that the backdrop of cheap money and rising inflation creates a bullish narrative for flight-to-safety assets such as equities, real estate and Bitcoin. He said:Pankaj Balani, CEO of the crypto derivatives platform Delta Exchange, meanwhile, anticipates Bitcoin to continue its bull run toward $50,000, citing options activity that he said remains heavily skewed to the upside at least until mid-August.Related: Bitcoin traders express mixed emotions about what’s next for BTC price“There is call buying activity across maturities — weekly, bi-weekly and monthly,” Balani told Cointelegraph in an email statement.

2021-07-29,"  Bitcoin's surge above $40,000 boosted the bulls' advantage in this month's $1.7 billion options expiry.  On Friday, July 30, a total of 42,850 Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts ($1.7 billion) are set to expire. This might be the first time since the May 21 weekly expiry that bulls will be able to profit from the $40,000 call (buy) options. The most recent surge in price may have been prompted by the rumor that Amazon would accept crypto payments, but after the e-commerce giant denied these rumors, BTC has held relatively steady. According to options markets, regardless of the reason behind the recent market strength, a few incentives are in place for bulls to sustain the $40,000 level.While the initial analysis favors the neutral-to-bullish call options by 21%, according to the call-to-put ratio, a decent number of those bets were placed at $45,000 and higher strikes. These options are almost worthless with less than 14 hours until maturity.Bears were overconfident for the monthly expiry, and 87% of the neutral-to-bearish put options have been placed at $39,000 or lower. If bears are to suppress the price below this level on July 30, a total of $105 million put options will be available.Meanwhile, the neutral-to-bullish call options below $39,000 amount to $320 million. The net result is a $215 million advantage favoring the neutral-to-bullish call options.Sustaining the price above $40,000 on July 30 would increase the bulls' lead by $140 million. This difference seems enough to justify a price push above that level, at least until 8:00 am UTC when Deribit expiry takes place.Bitcoin futures expiries occur simultaneously, but unlike options, longs and shorts are evenly matched at all times. An aggregate of $650 million in BTC futures is set to expire this Friday, but this will depend largely on the CME's $455 million because traders might close their position before the expiry, which happens on Friday at 3:00 pm UTC.At the moment, the options market data largely favors bulls, at least for the short term.

2021-07-29,"  The Federal Reserve chairman had to explain what he meant by the term ""transitory"" inflation as he admitted that consumer prices have gone higher than he and other central bank officials had anticipated. Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $40,000 on July 29, a day after the Federal Reserve hinted that it was getting nearer to unwinding its asset purchasing program that has boosted the economic recovery of the United States.The benchmark cryptocurrency previously approached $41,000 ahead of the critical Fed update. Nonetheless, it started losing upside momentum after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released its policy statement, followed by a press conference helmed by the Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell.As economists expected, Fed officials left their monetary policy unchanged at the end of their two-day policy meeting. They noted that the U.S. economy has advanced higher toward its maximum employment and inflation goals and that the Fed would continue to evaluate its stimulus policy in the coming months.Bitcoin investors have been closely monitoring how soon the central bank might unwind its $120-billion-per-month bond-buying program. That is partly because of the benchmark cryptocurrency's bull run from $4,000 to $65,000 against the Fed's loose monetary policies.Powell had earlier said that the Fed's asset purchases would continue until it sees ""substantial further progress"" in the U.S. economic recovery.But July 28's press conference was the first time the Fed had to explain what it sees as ""substantial further progress."" CNBC's Steve Liesman put the question before Powell, who responded that it means strong labor numbers and progress toward maximum employment. Follow-up questions by reporters pressed Powell into explaining what ""transitory"" means, a term he and his office had repeatedly used in their previous FOMC statements to sideline concerns about rising inflation in the United States. Powell took at least two minutes to address the sudden line of inquiry, noting that inflation will rise in the short term but won't rise year-over-year.Scott Skyrm, executive vice president of fixed income and repo at Curvature Securities, noted that the FOMC statement mentioned the term ""inflation"" or ""price stability"" 10 times. That shows that rising consumer prices are in the back of the Fed officials' minds, even though they refute its presence by resorting to the word ""transitory.""Lyn Alden Schwartzer, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, said Powell was trying to admit that inflation is not transitory in absolute terms — i.e., the Fed chair accepted that its ongoing policies would lead to ""permanent significant price increases."" She added:Alden's statements took cues from one of her recent newsletters. In it, she noted that the year-over-year inflation wobbled between highs and lows, thereby appearing transitory (the first chart below). Still, since the consumer prices remained at a permanently higher plateau after each inflationary spike, inflation kept rising (as shown in the second chart below).Skyrm noted that Powell's style of looking at ""substantial further progress"" as only maximum employment while completely sidelining inflation fears mean the Fed's tapering would respond to improved labor data not soaring consumer prices.Therefore, if the Delta variant of COVID-19 leads to another round of lockdowns, followed by more stimulus and unemployment benefits, one may not see normalization in the jobs market. That would mean more inflation in the times ahead.The take-away here isn’t about inflation. It’s how government regulation can distort the transmission of monetary policy. https://t.co/4gy3PhnEKS""I suspect that many may agree that this was one of the most confusing Fed press conferences,"" said Mohamed El-Arian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. Bitcoin has slid below $40,000 once more at time of publishing. The cryptocurrency risked correcting lower, owing to its overbought relative strength index (RSI) on a daily timeframe chart (an RSI reading above 70 typically limits further upside bids for an asset.)Related: Bitcoin price weekly outlook: BTC bulls await breakout above 50-day EMANevertheless, Gustavo De La Torre, business development director at the cryptocurrency exchange N.exchange, sees more demand for Bitcoin in the future as the Fed ignores inflationary worries. Calling Powell's statements a ""necessary vocal palliative,"" the analyst noted that investors would now likely secure their holdings in alternative assets as precautionary steps against consistent rising prices.""Bitcoin is one of the few prominent candidates for this bet by investors,"" he told Cointelegraph, adding that the digital asset's ability to attract retail and institutional investors even amid its interim bearish phases speaks volumes about its potential to reach a new record high. De La Torre added:"
2021-07-29,"  An allusion to the start of this year’s bullish progress comes as $40,000 refuses to go quietly as resistance. Bitcoin (BTC) futures open interest is mimicking the start of the BTC price bull run, data shows.As BTC/USD hovered near $40,000 on Thursday, a fresh bullish report from Stack Funds called for “cautious optimism” about further price rises.Bitcoin has sought to flip $40,000 to support this week, returning to the level multiple times and refusing to leave recent gains as a blow-off top.According to its latest weekly market appraisal, however, Stack Funds believes that it is derivatives that are giving stronger hints about potential bullish price continuation.Bitcoin open interest is currently exhibiting the style of increase that characterized Q4 last year — the springboard for current $64,500 all-time highs.“Those who wanted to accumulate lower might have missed out on the large swings, but fret not; re-adjusting your entry levels could reap you a more significant return on the bigger picture of this super cycle,” the report states.This Friday, meanwhile, sees the end-of-month expiry event for Bitcoin options, something that — at least in theory — allows for a release of potential selling pressure thereafter.Stack continued that given recent events, regardless of short-term price strength, a return to fresh lows near previous all-time highs of $20,000 was “less likely.”Related: Bitcoin fails to flip $40K with traders eyeing $36K or lower for supportOn the flipside, resistance bands as yet untouched remain a dark cloud on the immediate horizon for bulls.“There are also several major resistances ahead; such as the $41,000 resistance level, which coincides with July’s 1.618 Fib, and also the $45,000 daily 200MA level,” the firm added. Order book data from major exchange Binance highlighted a high resistance band concentration in the area above $41,000."
2021-07-29,"  RUNE, QNT and PERP continue to gather strength even as analysts expect a lower support test for the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are locked in a battle with bears to take control of the $40,000 level and dovish comments from the United States Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, suggest that loose monetary policies will remain in place for the foreseeable future.Generally, the crypto ecosystem is “cautiously optimistic” about further price rises as the fallout from China’s miner purge begins to subside and displaced miners begin to establish mining operations in other countries, resulting in a rebound of the Bitcoin hash rate.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that while the momentum in Bitcoin has slowed down, several altcoins have gained more than 30% on the 24-hour chart, led by THORChain (RUNE), Quant (QNT) and Perpetual Protocol (PERP). The top performer over the past 24 hours has been THORChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol that facilitates the exchange of cryptocurrencies across multiple networks while allowing the tokenholder to retain full custody of their assets.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for RUNE on July 24, prior to the recent price rise. The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for RUNE first spiked to a high of 85 on July 24 and then pulled back slightly over the next two days and registered a high of 75 on July 26, around 18 hours before its price began to rally 65% over the next two days. The price of RUNE has been hammered in recent weeks after a series of protocol exploits resulted in $7.6 million worth of funds being drained from the platform, but it appears as if the fallout from that has now subsided.The second-largest gainer in the past 24-hours was Quant (QNT), a project focused on interoperability between different blockchain networks. According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for QNT have been favorable for some time. As seen on the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for QNT began to pick up on July 25 and reached a high of 81, around 24 hours before the price increased 75% over the next two days.The NewsQuake™ alert system caught the announcement from Binance that it would be listing QNT just before its price began to significantly rise from $96 to an intraday high at $144.75.

As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for PERP climbed into the green on July 25 and reached a high of 79 early on July 26, around 24 hours before the price increased by 52% over the next two days. The building momentum behind PERP comes following the release of Curie, a second version of the Perpetual Protocol.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-29,"  One trader spotted the fractal, which employs three classic technical indicators to predict an upside trend for Ethereum. Ethereum's native asset Ether (ETH) faces prospects of closing above $14,000 sometime in 2021 based on its current trend's striking similarity with the one from last year.First spotted by user TradingShot, the Ethereum fractal involves three technical indicators: a 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA), a Fibonacci channel, and a relative strength index (RSI).Ether closed above its 50-day SMA in July 2021, the first time since the May 2021 bearish correction. As TradingShot noted, breaking above the said moving average wave historically predicts bull runs. For instance, a run-up above the 50-day SMA in April 2020 took the ETH/USD exchange rate from around $170 to over $500 in September 2020 — in only 137 days.The period of extreme upside gains also witnessed Ether's daily RSI shooting higher from 60 (neutral) to over 90 (overbought). Meanwhile, as the cryptocurrency rallied, its price moves found interim support and resistance levels inside a Fibonacci channel.TradingShot recounted multiple instances based on the April-September 2020 fractal, each showing Ether closing above its 50-day SMA and rallying higher inside the Fibonacci channel while its RSI wobbled between neutral and overbought levels. The same is happening in July 2021.""Once [the 50-day SMA] breaks, it takes ETH either 132, 137 or 70 days to reach its next top on the Fibonacci scale,"" the analysts stressed. ""As you see, tops are progressive one level higher each time—first 1.0, then 1.5, and the most recent in May on 2.0 Fib).""Approximately, the 1.0 level on the next leg upward could have ETH/USD test $4,000. Meanwhile, an extended uptrend could have the pair reach 1.5 and 2.0 Fibonacci levels, which coincides with $6,000 and $9,000, respectively.Related: Price analysis 7/28: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, XRP, DOGE, DOT, UNI, BCH, LTCBut TradingShot noted that on each rally after closing above the 50-day SMA, Ether's upside target progresses one level higher on the Fibonacci scale. Therefore, the cryptocurrency's next price target may be at the 2.5 Fib level, which is above $14,000.

2021-07-29,"  “Stablecoin experimentation is happening in real-time with billions of dollars at stake in this vast permissionless lab we call DeFi,” reads a new research report from ShapeShift. The author focuses on the rise of algorithmic stablecoins and their potential use cases.   Promising innovations in DeFi have given rise to a new breed of stablecoins that have the potential to reduce volatility and promote greater decentralization, according to a new research report from ShapeShift. In its latest New Frontiers research study, ShapeShift explores the recent growth of “algorithmic stablecoins,” which are cryptocurrencies that automatically adjust an asset’s supply and other important parameters to reduce volatility. In his analysis, author Kent Barton, who heads research and development at ShapeShift, focuses on three assets: RAI, FRAX and FEI.Related: ShapeShift to decentralize entire company, plans for largest airdrop in historyBarton summarizes the potential value proposition of algorithmic stablecoins as follows:The author explains that algo-based stablecoins differ from their fiat-backed and crypto-collateralized counterparts, but also noted that algorithmic and crypto-collateralized variants aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. These stablecoins “are collateralized to a certain extent, but also feature in-protocol mechanisms to manage supply and reduce volatility,” he said.Related: ShapeShift report calls ‘staking derivatives’ a potential win-win for PoS usersRAI, FRAX and FEI have all received various levels of support from the crypto community, though FEI is the largest of the three in terms of market capitalization at roughly $350 million. By comparison, FRAX has a total market value of $245 million, whereas RAI is valued at roughly $28 million, according to Coingecko data. RAI follows a “redemption price” protocol that targets secondary-market sales, which allows it to maintain stability over time versus the underlying ETH-based asset. Barton says RAI is a more suitable option for traders as opposed to long-term investors. FRAX is collateralized by USDC, though its total backing is always less than the supply of FRAX. That makes it under-collateralized and the stability mechanism is supported by using USDC as opposed to ETH. FEI differs markedly from these projects by using a bonding curve that sells FEI for ETH. Wealth entering the system is locked in something called Protocol Controlled Value, which is used to maintain the peg through liquidity management on exchanges. Related: Fei Protocol genesis locks up $1 billion in ETH, but LPs could face lossesBarton concludes by stating that algorithmic stablecoins are still in their early stages, which means their success is far from guaranteed. Nevertheless, this emerging asset class is unique for its regulatory profile, potentially positive impact on DeFi and ability to facilitate niche use cases. "
2021-07-29,"  Bitcoin's defense of the $38,000 level and renewed interest from institutional investors could be a sign that the bull trend is resuming. Bitcoin (BTC) and most major altcoins are attempting to break above their respective overhead resistance levels, indicating the return of the bulls.Data from Bybt shows that the Grayscale premium has been climbing and reached -5.88% on July 27, its closest level to zero since May 25. This suggests that institutional investors may have again started building positions via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Another institutional investment product showing a possible return of buyers is Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF whose assets under management rose to 1.1 billion Canadian dollars on July 27, its highest level since May 13.Swiss private bank Vontobel said in its half-year financial report that its Bitcoin tracker certificate investment product had generated significant interest from clients. Vontobel CEO Zeno Staub said to Bloomberg that its wealthy clients have allocated a part of their wealth to cryptocurrencies.Horizon Kinetics co-founder Peter Doyle also told the Financial Times that the world economy is at an inflection point because of the pandemic and mounting debt. This “means either default or currency debasement.” Therefore, Doyle said people should have exposure to cryptocurrencies.With institutional interest returning to Bitcoin, could the rally continue or will bears again stall the recovery near overhead resistance levels? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin’s long wick on the July 26 candlestick shows that bears aggressively sold near $40,550 but the positive sign is that bulls flipped the $36,670 level into support on July 27. This indicates a possible change in sentiment from sell on rallies to buy on dips.The bulls pushed the price above $40,550 today but the wick on today’s candlestick suggests that bears have not yet surrendered. They will again try to stall the recovery in the overhead resistance zone at $41,330 to $42,451.67.If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead zone, the BTC/USDT pair could again drop to $36,670. A strong bounce off this level will suggest that bulls are not waiting for a sharper dip to get in.The pair could then consolidate between $36,670 and $42,451.67 for the next few days, improving the prospects of a break above the range. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen into the overbought zone, indicating that bulls are back in the game.This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below the moving averages. That will bring the large range between $42,451.67 and $28,805 into play.Ether (ETH) turned down from the downtrend line on July 26 but the bears could not sink and sustain the price below the moving averages. This suggests that bulls are buying on minor dips.The moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover and the RSI has risen into the positive zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If bulls drive the price above the downtrend line, the momentum may pick up. That could open the doors for a possible rally to $3,000. Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and dips below the moving averages, the ETH/USDT pair could gradually drop to the critical support at $1,728.74. The long wick on the July 26 candlestick suggests that bears sold at higher levels. They attempted to trap the aggressive bulls by pulling Binance Coin (BNB) back below the downtrend line but the buyers did not relent. The bulls defended the 20-day exponential moving average ($304) on July 27 and are attempting to push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($312) today. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $340.A breakout and close above $340 will clear the path for a possible rally to $400 and then to $433. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could result in a fall to $254.52.The long wick on Cardano’s (ADA) July 26 candlestick suggests that traders are selling on rallies. The bears tried to pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($1.25) on July 27 but failed, indicating buying at lower levels.This may have reinvigorated the buyers who are again trying to push the price above the 50-day SMA ($1.33). If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could gradually rise to $1.50. This level may pose a stiff challenge for buyers but if they can overcome it, the pair could start its northward journey toward $1.94.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and slides below $1.20, it will indicate that bears continue to sell at every higher level. That may result in a retest of the critical support at $1.Although bears successfully defended the 50-day SMA ($0.67) on July 26, they could not pull XRP back below the 20-day EMA ($0.62). This suggests that bulls are accumulating on dips.Sustained buying from the bulls today has pushed the XRP/USDT pair above the 50-day SMA for the first time since May 19. If buyers can clear the hurdle at $0.75, the pair will complete a double bottom pattern. This setup has a target objective at $1.The 20-day EMA is attempting to turn up and the RSI has risen above 62, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $0.75, the bears will again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair may extend its consolidation between $0.50 and $0.75 for a few more days.The long wick on Dogecoin’s (DOGE) July 26 candlestick suggests that bears are defending the 50-day SMA ($0.23) aggressively. The sellers attempted to sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.20) on July 27 but failed.This suggests that buyers have not given up and will make one more attempt to push the price above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could start a relief rally that may reach $0.28 and then $0.33. On the contrary, if the price again turns down from the 50-day SMA, several short-term traders may close their position. That could result in a break below the 20-day EMA, which may clear the path for a decline to $0.15.The bears attempted to sink Polkadot (DOT) below the $13 support on July 27 but failed, which suggests that bulls are accumulating at lower levels.The buyers will now try to push the price toward the overhead resistance at $16.93. This level may again act as stiff resistance but the flat 20-day EMA ($13.95) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that sellers may be losing their grip.If bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA during the next correction, the prospects of a break above $16.93 will improve. That could signal the start of a sustained relief rally to $20 and later to $26.50.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $13. That could result in a retest of $10.37.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the downtrend line on July 26, indicating that bears are aggressively defending this resistance. Although the price broke below the 20-day EMA ($18.25) on July 27, the bulls bought this dip.The buyers will now again attempt to push the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will invalidate the developing bearish descending triangle pattern. The failure of a bearish setup is a bullish sign as aggressive bears are forced to cover their short positions.That could open the doors for a possible rally to $24 and then to the critical overhead resistance at $30. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below $17.24, the UNI/USDT pair could start its downward journey toward $13.Related: Ethereum pares gains, Bitcoin pushed under $40K as Fed set to reveal tapering plansBitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($504) on July 26 but the bulls defended the 20-day EMA ($471) on July 27. This suggests a tough tussle between the bulls and the bears.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, indicating that bulls are attempting to make a comeback. A breakout and close above $546.83 will signal the start of a sustained relief rally as the BCH/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern.This up-move could face stiff resistance at $650.35 but if crossed, the rally could reach the pattern target at $710.13. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could extend its range-bound action for a few more days. Litecoin (LTC) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($138) on July 26 but the positive sign is that bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($128). The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance in the overhead zone between the 50-day SMA and $146.54. If the price turns down from this zone and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above $146.54, the LTC/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $189.25. The RSI above 57 and the flat 20-day EMA points to a marginal advantage to buyers.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-28,"  The two cryptocurrencies appear directionless after correcting in sync lower from their monthly highs. Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back on Wednesday as investors awaited fresh guidance from the United States Federal Reserve.ETH’s price slipped by 0.57% to $2,857, while the BTC/USD prices were up 0.68%, changing hands at $39,739 at around 10:30 am EST. Nevertheless, both pairs reached their current levels following a downside correction from their respective intraday highs of $2,391 and $40,925, respectively.Traders raised their exposure in the cryptocurrency market after Tesla’s Elon Musk, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey spoke in favor of Bitcoin during “The ₿ Word” conference last week. More tailwinds came amid speculations about Amazon’s plans to accept BTC as a payment, a rumor that the retail giant later denied.Ether, whose 30-day correlation with Bitcoin stands at 88%, moved in tandem with Bitcoin. Their synchronized price trends continued into the New York trading session Wednesday, just as markets waited for the U.S. Federal Reserve to reveal its tapering plans.U.S. central bank officials will conclude their two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, with a statement scheduled to come out at 2:00 pm EST. Investors’ focus will be on signals from Chairman Jerome Powell about how and when the Fed would start unwinding its asset purchase program and any potential shift in its view on inflation.In detail, the U.S. Consumer Price Index has boomed, hitting 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. As a result, as many as 54% of Americans think that the U.S. economy is in poor shape, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.But the Fed has rubbished the higher consumer prices by calling them ""transitory"" in nature. As a result, Powell said in his congressional testimony earlier this month that the central bank would continue its $120-billion-a-month bond-purchasing program, raising concerns that it could cause further inflationary spikes, especially in the housing sector.Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy for Mediolanum International Funds, noted that there are no signs of inflation cooling down in the sessions ahead, so the Fed might just start looking into the rising consumer prices, if not putting a pause on its bond-buying program. He added:The Ether and Bitcoin markets’ biggest vulnerability is that their valuations may not be sustained without expanding liquidity from the Fed. Related: Bitcoin bull outlines 7 steps to more fiscal stimulus and higher BTC pricesMeanwhile, the strong underpinning is that there is substantial capital sitting on the sidelines waiting to enter the market, with a DataTrek Research report noting that retail investors on Robinhood alone hold $400 billion to enter markets on the next big dip. Fred’s Retail Money Fund also notes that retail investors hold over $1 trillion versus $643 billion in 2015.“We live in an unprecedented time of fiscal and monetary stimulus,” noted Anthony Pompliano, a prominent crypto advocate and a partner at Pomp Investments, in one of his recent notes to clients. He added that investors would do so much better while putting money in financial instruments than holding cash or negative-yielding assets. He said:Given 20% of the American public know BTC well enough to hold it, and at current growth rates, shitting on #Bitcoin will be political suicide in the next few years.Tim Frost, CEO of DeFi wealth management platform Yield App, weighed concerns over analysts’ renewed upside outlook for Ether and Bitcoin. He told Cointelegraph that the markets could resume their downtrend following “a brief rally,” wherein Bitcoin falls to as low as $20,000, taking Ether lower alongside.

2021-07-28,"  An analyst promises an “interesting few days” as volatility firmly reenters the Bitcoin market and sentiment transforms. Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $40,000 on Wednesday as bulls and bears waged a tug-of-war for hard-won higher ground.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $40,200 overnight, sealing a rare eight straight green daily candles in a row.Investors had been initially skeptical of the strength of the initial rally, which began Monday, after a snap surge past the $40,000 mark followed by a roughly 9% correction.For Sam Trabucco, a qualitative crypto trader at Alameda Research, such behavior was of little surprise, based on previous rallies, but the next few days should be tense.“A lot can happen from here — BTC has had a stock beta, so there’s potential for it to remain sorta beholden to that, and there has historically been ‘round number resistance’ maybe causing it to struggle staying >$40k,” he concluded in a series of tweets on Wednesday.His predictions came as shorts nonetheless remained low on major exchange Bitfinex on the day — earlier this month, sudden increases had noticeably influenced short-term price pressure.Examining buy and sell levels on major exchange Binance, meanwhile, showed $38,500 growing as Bitcoin’s nearest support level, with $41,000 likewise hardening as resistance.For better or worse, this week’s price action has had a sizeable impact on market sentiment.Related: GBTC premium matches Bitcoin price crash levels as unlocking fear fadesAccording to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, fear has all but drained from the mindset of market participants, with its measure gauge reaching 50, or “neutral” territory, for the first time since the May BTC price crash.The Index has doubled in just two days, and last week scored just 10/100, corresponding to market sentiment of “extreme fear.”There could nonetheless be room to grow — April’s all-time highs were accompanied by an “extreme greed” score of 95/100."
2021-07-28,"  After six weeks pacing between $30,000 and $36,000, BTC’s price is now hovering around $40,000 resistance once again in two days.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility made headlines again after the original cryptocurrency briefly reclaimed its $40,000 mark before going back to $39,000 levels. Coming after a two-week-long bearish loom that started on July 15, this is the second time Bitcoin is trying to break $40,000 resistance in as many days. Based on the data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, BTC witnessed a bull run for trading pair BTC/USD from 21 July that resulted in a spike of 34.13% in just seven days. The crypto community attributes the rising BTC price directly to the increased involvement of traditional banks and entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Michael Saylor. This week, Amazon’s rumored involvement in crypto also pushed the price, although the tech giant later denied those rumors.While the current price indicators suggest that Bitcoin may stick to its ongoing support of the $30,000–$40,000 mark, BTC is yet to see a positive change of $20,000 before it can reach its former glory of $60,000.What may seem like a good indication, the sudden push to exit an immediate resistance does not accompany the $30,000 corridor. By the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is closing in on $39,500.Related: Bitcoin price seeks higher low as trader forecasts $45K breakout within weeksIn a recent survey conducted by CNBC on a group of portfolio managers and equity strategists, 44% of the respondents felt that Bitcoin’s price would fall down below $30,000.

2021-07-28,"  Trading volumes for ETH increased by 1,461% over the first half of 2021. The world’s second-largest crypto asset has gained ground on Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of trading volume growth during the first half of this year according to a new report.Ether’s trading volume grew faster than Bitcoin’s in the first half of this year, according to a new report from leading American crypto exchange Coinbase.The Coinbase Institutional “H1 2021 in Review” report, released on Monday, acknowledged that the first half of this year has been one of the most active periods on record for crypto, with several new all-time highs in prices, user adoption and trading activity.Taking data from 20 exchanges across the globe, the report revealed that the trading volume for Bitcoin reached $2.1 trillion for the period, up 489% from $356 billion over the first half of last year.Ether’s (ETH) total trading volume reached $1.4 trillion, but its growth was much faster, up 1,461% from $92 billion in the first half of 2020. Coinbase remarked that it has been the first sustained period of time ever that Ether’s trading pace exceeded Bitcoin’s.The research also measured total crypto market capitalization, which began the year at $769 billion, peaked at $2.4 trillion in May, and ended the period at $1.4 trillion, registering a net gain of 86% year to date.Related: Ethereum has strong fundamentals, so why are pro traders bearish on ETH?It noted that the bulk of BTC’s gains came during Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 before the crypto asset’s price declined in Q2 2021. It is currently trading down 38.8% from its April 13 all-time high of $65,899.Ether, on the other hand, saw the majority of its gains in Q2 2021 when it doubled in price to reach an all-time high of $4,357 on May 12. However, it has retreated an even deeper 47.4% to current levels.The second-most valuable crypto asset appreciated 895% over the 12-month period and 210% over the six-month period ending June 30. Coinbase attributed a number of factors to this including increased usage in decentralized finance, investor optimism in the network’s transition to proof-of-stake, and the rise of layer-two scaling solutions for the network.In January, Cointelegraph predicted that Ether will become the main asset for investors in 2021. Both BTC and ETH have rallied over the past week, gaining 32.4% and 27.7%, respectively, according to CoinGecko."
2021-07-27,"  Bitcoin consolidates below $38,000 following yesterday’s rally above $40,000, while altcoins give back most of their gains. The wider cryptocurrency market entered a period of consolidation on Tuesday following Bitcoin’s (BTC) brief spike above $40,000 the day before, which helped ignite a rally across the market and brought a renewed sense of optimism to the market. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that a mid-day attempt by bulls to lift the price of BTC back above the $40,000 level was rejected, resulting in a price pullback to $37,500. While Tuesday’s price pullback may suggest that Monday’s rally was simply a short squeeze, others point to the rising Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium, which is now at its highest levels in months at -5.88%, suggesting that institutions are once again betting on more BTC price upside. Rumors that Amazon will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments in 2021 helped ignite the market-wide rally seen on Monday, though it was officially denied by the company later on. However, as pointed out by pseudonymous independent market analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s price chart shows a fractal pattern that is similar to the price-performance in October 2020 — just before BTC’s price began its run to a new all-time high. When was the last time #BTC broke beyond the 50-day EMA resistance?Back in October 2020This is when $BTC formed a very similar fractal of Bitcoin's current price action#Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/2acUC9KoeVIf a similar pattern plays out in the current market, Bitcoin’s price will see a continuation of the uptrend that the Amazon rumors initiated. Not all of this suggests a continuation of the upward momentum, however, as was pointed out by Jarvis Labs analyst and co-founder Ben Lilly, who has been monitoring on-chain data to gain deeper insight into the most recent pump, particularly with Ethereum’s London hard fork slated for Aug. 4.Lilly said:An example of bearish bias, however, was provided by the pseudonymous Twitter user Bear Wolf, who saw Monday’s developments as nothing more than a short squeeze amid a wider bear market. “19K is still my target for the end of the bear market,” he wrote. “Dead Cat Bounce to 46K (Short Squeeze).

Warren urges Treasury Secretary Yellen to combat rising crypto threatsA large percentage of the gains seen in the altcoin market on Monday was given back on Tuesday as the euphoria from the Amazon rumors subsided. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) were the two hardest-hit tokens in the top 20, seeing losses of 10% and 10.8%, respectively, while Monday’s top performers Strike (STRK) and Venus (XVS) both dropped by 16%. A pair of 30% gains from Axie Infinity (AXS) and MyNeighborAlice (ALICE) marked the best performances of the day, while the blockchain-based identity management solution Civic (CVC) saw its price increase by 20%.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.488 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 47.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-26,"  A falling wedge setup, as well as a rumor of Amazon preparing to accept cryptos, also boosts Ether’s upside appeal. The price of Ether (ETH) jumped to a three-week high on Monday, triggered by similar gains in the Bitcoin (BTC) market that appeared in the wake of rumors about Amazon’s foray into the cryptocurrency sector.A job posting from the retail giant showed that it is seeking an executive to build its “digital currency and blockchain strategy.” Meanwhile, global media reports have been speculating, based on inside sources that Amazon would start accepting Bitcoin as payments. As a result, the BTC/USD exchange rate surged to its six-week high after the news.Ether, whose 30-day correlation with Bitcoin stands at 88%, surged likewise on Amazon’s crypto integration rumor. On Monday, the ETH/USD exchange rate soared to an intraday high of $2,390, reaching its highest level since July 8. The pair was up more than 6.7% as of 12:20 GMT. However, measuring from its previous bottom of $1,720 on Tuesday, the net upside rebound came out to be 38.94%. The retracement looked strikingly similar to the bullish price action between June 22 and July 7, wherein ETH/USD rebounded by more than 40% after bottoming out at $1,700.That said, Ether bottomed out twice near the $1,700 range before rebounding higher by 38%–40%. Analyst Jonny Moe spotted that mirrored retracements move and ruled them out as a double bottom pattern.In detail, double bottoms are bullish trend reversal patterns, consisting of two troughs around the same level hanging by a neckline resistance. As it plays out, the price eventually flips the neckline resistance as support and rallies higher by as much as the maximum pattern’s height.Ether fits the description. It has formed two consecutive bottom levels at around $1,700. Meanwhile, its neckline resistance is near $2,390. Therefore, the maximum pattern’s height is $690.Should the ETH/USD rate break above the $2,390 neckline resistance, accompanied by a spike in volume, the pair will be expected to extend its upside move by approximately $690. That would roughly take it toward $3,000 (with $2,948 serving as a psychological bullish target based on historical price action).Another technical pattern in play outdoes the double bottom setup’s upside target by predicting Ether prices at near $3,250.Related: Ethereum bounces but ETH price in danger of turning $2.3K into new resistanceDubbed as a falling wedge, the pattern develops when the price trades lower inside a range that begins wide but contracts during the downtrend. It eventually prompts the price to break bullish while setting up its profit target at a level situated typically above the wedge height (if measured from the breakout point).So, it appears, the ETH/USD exchange rate is undergoing a bullish breakout confirmed by a high-volumed close above the wedge resistance trendline. The profit-taking target for the current setup is $1,208 above the breakout level, which puts the price en route to $3,257.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-26,"  A surge toward $40,000 brings hope to those who have endured months of bearish drawdowns, but is it enough to continue the bull market? Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing $40,000 this Monday as a new week gets underway with a bang for bulls.A calm but confident weekend culminated in a dramatic run-up overnight Sunday, with BTC/USD swiftly nearing the top of its multi-month trading range.With favorable fundamentals and a lot of liquidated bears, Bitcoin looks set to investigate levels not seen in several weeks.What could shape price action as the week continues? Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors to consider when charting BTC price action in the coming days.Spot price action is, naturally, the topic on everyone’s radar at present — in 24 hours, Bitcoin has sealed gains of nearly 15%.While not yet flipping $40,000 to resistance, current levels have not been around since mid June, and appetite for bullishness is palpable.It began slowly following last week’s “The ₿ Word” conference, which featured praise of Bitcoin from the likes of Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk.A breakout was not immediately apparent, however, and progress was slow, as analysts remained wary of a market that they thought could still easily collapse to new cycle lows.In the event, however, Bitcoin slowly inched up through the week, taking out $34,500 over the weekend and opening up the prospect of a run higher.An impulse move was widely anticipated, including by Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, with potential targets lying within the established medium-term range with $42,000 as its ceiling.On Monday, however, even van de Poppe appeared taken aback by the veracity of the move higher, calling it a “surprise.”“After such a move of Bitcoin, altcoins will follow suit,” he predicted on Twitter. Fellow trader Crypto Ed was more cautious. Highlighting Elliott Wave analysis, he argued that even a return of the bull market would not be without its sticking points and that $29,000 could still return after $42,000 in line with his previous predictions.For those who follow Elliott Wave: technically spoken, the move to new lows is still possible as long as we don't break white 2. But based on the lower TF labelling of this impulsive move, I'd expect a break above 2 and invalidating the move ot 26-27k1/2 pic.twitter.com/M4FJ4YRdrI“Doesn’t mean we go up in 1 straight line, pullbacks/corrections/retests will happen after we break 42k but new lows are very unlikely to happen once 41.5-42k is broken,” he reasoned Monday.Bitcoin’s declining relationship to traditional markets is back in the spotlight, making price action look all the more “impulsive.”Whereas rising stocks have been accompanied by flat or even negative performance in BTC/USD recently, the tables have turned over the past few days. Now, equities are treading water over headwinds from China, while Bitcoin soars.A crackdown from Beijing has overshadowed previous strength in United States markets, and this combined with increasing worries over inflation and central bank stimulus tapering makes for a shaky mood, an analyst told Bloomberg Monday.“The second half of the year is going to be this glass half-full, half-empty context,” Virginie Maisonneuve, global chief investment officer for equity at Allianz Global Investors, told the publication’s TV network.As Crypto Ed continues to stress, meanwhile, the strength of the U.S. dollar is also worth paying attention to in the short term. Currently still on a rebound, the USD currency index (DXY) is expected to hit local highs around the 94 mark before falling again — this latter move giving Bitcoin some real breathing space.Until then, however, DXY could ultimately pressure cryptocurrency markets.“Expecting DXY to drop more in coming days, BTC should see more relief bounce because of that,” he said Thursday alongside an accompanying chart. Is up always good? Not if you’re short BTC.As commentators were already suggesting recently while BTC/USD was still close to $30,000, the “maximum pain” scenario would likely not be fresh losses, but rather a dramatic reversal to the upside.That is exactly what happened — the 15% overnight gains took a serious toll on those market participants who were convinced that a crash was incoming.According to monitoring resource Bybt, 24-hour liquidations totaled $1.1 billion on Monday, the most since May 18. “$111,000,000 of shorts liquidated in 10 minutes,” analyst William Clemente III added, citing further data from analytics firm Glassnode. It’s far from the first time that bears have been caught unaware — the nature of Bitcoin has ensured time and time again that those who are overly negative ultimately get pushed out.A recovery in Bitcoin fundamentals, which has been underway much longer than price, continues unabated this week.The hash rate is approaching 100 exahashes per second (EH/s) again, a positive sign that has been accompanied by increasing decentralization of the hash rate overall.Gains have been brisk over the past week when the hash rate was still lingering near local lows of 83 EH/s. At its height before the price drawdown in May, the hash rate reached 168 EH/s.A similar story is apparent in network difficulty, which at the time of writing is forecast to increase by around 3.7% at the next readjustment in five days’ time.If it happens, it will be the first positive difficulty change since May’s mining rout, and a strong signal that the effects of the accompanying upheaval have been mitigated.While dubious, the concept of Bitcoin’s “eco-friendliness” remains an important topic, with large miners leveraging the narrative to reassure skeptical markets of Bitcoin’s longevity.The statistics speak for themselves — renewable and sustainable energy is increasingly powering the Bitcoin network as miners relocate to suitable jurisdictions.Those worried that the price gains may be a case of “too much too soon” can take heart in the relatively calm sentiment that has accompanied them.Related: Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ETH, ICP, AAVE, LUNAAccording to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the shift toward $40,000 has not changed the overall market mood based on “fear.”On Monday, the Index measured 26/100 — signaling fear, rather than greed or a “neutral” atmosphere — with the implication that Bitcoin could rise further without investors feeling overly greedy and apt to spark a sell-off.“Bitcoin fear and greed index has been under 40 for over 2 months — the longest ever time period,” Danny Scott, CEO of exchange CoinCorner, noted last week. The past months have seen “extreme fear” reign, meanwhile, a trait that recently also characterized traditional markets."
2021-07-26,"  Bitcoin has quickly surged to test resistance at $40,000 for the first time this month. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surged more than 10% over just a few hours earlier today, with prices quickly surging from roughly $35,000 to tag just shy of $40,000 on Monday.Price action shows a violent short squeeze that occurred as prices broke above $35,000, with bullish momentum suddenly accelerating as prices quickly rallied 15% from roughly $34,000 to $39,800 over the course of less than three hours.And folks, we have our squeeze. https://t.co/Lflcp7MZuwBy contrast, BTC had taken the past five days to gain from roughly $30,000 to $34,000. As of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands for roughly $38,500.According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is the top gainer for the past 24 hours among the top 30 crypto assets by capitalization, posting a gain of nearly 13%.The sudden rally has seen numerous technical indicators return to offering bullish signals, with popular analyst Lark Davis informing his 426,000 followers that BTC’s price is again trending above its 50-day moving average.Oooohhhh..... #bitcoin just reclaimed the 50 day moving average! Nice! pic.twitter.com/xpS3kiUV16Polkadot’s DOT and Chainlink’s LINK are also among the day’s top gainers, each having increased by more than 11% in the past 24 hours.With Dogecoin (DOGE) up less than 9% for the day, it would appear the impact of Elon Musk’s Twitter account on the meme coin’s markets is beginning to wane, with Tesla’s CEO posting a meme asserting that “Dogecoin is money” on Sunday.Despite Musk’s efforts, Dogecoin appears to have moved in lock-step with the broader altcoin markets, with most large-cap crypto assets having posted high single-digit gains for the day.#bitcoin is moneyRelated: Bitcoin price hints at 'megaphone' bottom pattern, and a breakout toward $40KDespite next month’s fast-approaching London upgrades for Ethereum, Ether (ETH) is also lagging behind the pack, posting a gain of roughly 7% for the past 24 hours. As such, ETH is the weakest-performing cryptocurrency ranked among the top 10 by capitalization for the past day."
2021-07-25,"  In technical analysis, traders interpret the head and shoulders formation as a strong sign that a trend reversal is in process. Traders tend to focus too much on timing the right entry to a trade, but very few focus on developing a strategy for exiting positions. If one sells too early, sizable gains are left on the table and if the position is held for too long, the markets quickly snatch back the profits. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and close a trade as soon as the trend starts to reverse.One classical setup that is considered reliable in spotting a trend reversal is the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. On the longer timeframes, the H&S pattern does not form often, but when it does, traders should take note and act accordingly.Let’s look at a few ways to identify the H&S pattern and when to act on it.The H&S pattern forms after a bull phase and indicates that a reversal may be around the corner. As the name indicates, the formation consists of a head, a left shoulder, a right shoulder, and a distinct neckline. When the pattern completes, the trend usually reverses direction.The above image shows the structure of an H&S pattern. Before the formation of the setup, the asset is in an uptrend. At the peak where the left shoulder forms, traders book profits and this results in a decline. This forms the first trough but it is not yet a strong enough signal to provoke a trend change. Lower levels again attract buying because the trend is still bullish and buyers manage to push the price above the left shoulder, but they are not able to sustain the uptrend. Profit-booking by the bulls and shorting by counter-trend traders pull the price down, which finds support near the previous trough. Joining these two troughs forms the neckline of the setup.As the price rebounds off the neckline, the bulls make one more attempt to resume the uptrend but as the price reaches the height close to the left shoulder, profit-booking sets in and the rally fizzles out. This lower peak forms the right shoulder and is usually in line with the left shoulder. The up-move reverses and the selling picks up momentum. Finally, the bears succeed in pulling the price below the neckline. This completes the bearish pattern and the trend reverses from bullish to bearish.Bitcoin (BTC) started a strong up-move after breaking out at $20,000 in December 2020. The BTC/USDT pair hit a local peak at $61,844 on March 13 and the price corrected, forming a trough on March 25. This local peak was the left shoulder.The bulls considered the dip as a buying opportunity because the trend was still up. Aggressive buying then pushed the price above $61,844 and the pair hit a new all-time high at $64,854 on April 14. This level attracted selling, which pulled the price down to form the second trough on April 25. The middle peak, higher than the other peaks, formed the head.Another attempt by the bulls to resume the uptrend failed on May 10. This formed the right shoulder and the ensuing correction broke below the neckline of the pattern. The breakdown and close below the neckline on May 15 completed this bearish setup.Sometimes, after the breakdown, the price retests the breakdown level from the neckline but when the momentum is strong the retest may not happen, an example which is shown in the chart above.To calculate the pattern target of this setup, determine the distance from the neckline to the top of the head. In this case, the value is $15,150. This distance is then subtracted from the breakdown point on the neckline to arrive at the minimum target objective. In the above example, the breakdown happened close to $48,000. This projected a pattern target at $32,850. This figure should be used as a guide because sometimes the decline exceeds the target, and in other scenarios the down move ends without reaching the target objective.Sometimes traders jump the gun and take counter-trend positions before the price breaks below the neckline of the developing H&S formation. Other times, the break below the neckline does not see follow-up selling and the price climbs back above the neckline. These instances may lead to failed setup, trapping the aggressive bears who are forced to cover their positions and this results in a short squeeze.Cardano (ADA) started an uptrend from the $0.10 level on Nov. 20, 2020. The uptrend hit resistance in the $0.35 to $0.40 zone in January and a H&S pattern started developing. The price dipped to the neckline on Jan. 27, but the bears could not sink and close the ADA/USDT pair below the support.When the price rebounded off the neckline on Jan. 28, it was a signal that the sentiment remained bullish. There was a minor hiccup on Jan. 30 and 31 when bears attempted to stall the up-move near the right shoulder but sustained buying from the bulls pushed the price above the head on Feb. 1. This break above the head of the pattern invalidated the setup. When a bearish setup fails, it catches several aggressive sellers on the wrong foot. This results in a short squeeze and propels the price higher. The same thing happened in the above example and the pair soared in February.The H&S pattern is considered a reliable reversal pattern but there are some important points to bear in mind.A downward sloping or flat neckline is considered to be a more reliable pattern compared to an upsloping neckline. Traders should wait for the price to break down and close below the neckline before initiating trades. Pre-empting the setup could result in losses because a failed bearish pattern could result in a strong rally.The pattern targets should only be used as a guide because sometimes the price may overshoot and continue the down move and at other times it may reverse direction before reaching the target objective.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-24,"  The megaphone-shaped pattern reflects growing disagreement between investors over the next Bitcoin trend bias. Bitcoin's (BTC) latest rebound from below $30,000 has increased its prospects of extending its retracement move higher, at least according to one classic technical pattern.Dubbed as Broadening Formation, the megaphone-shaped pattern appears when the price moves inside two diverging trendlines. Investopedia states that a broadening formation represents disagreement over the next potential bias among investors. As a result, the price forms higher interim peaks and lower interim lows.Bitcoin appears to be trading inside a similar structure, as shown in the chart below. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency lacks volatility, one of the key features of the broadening formation pattern.Should the pattern play out, the Bitcoin price will undergo a bullish breakout above the structure's upper trendline. In doing so, it would expect to rise by as much as the maximum height between the broadening formation's upper and lower trendline. The upside setup appears because traders interpret broadening formation as a trend reversal pattern.ive been here before, and if your new to the megaphone bottom pattern then here you go ;-)...and yes our #tbts #scriptA scooped up this price here$btc $btcusd #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency #xbt #xbtusd #btcusdt #btcusdc https://t.co/b9D6MzoKlE pic.twitter.com/nufz9dYDMfBut until then, the pattern offers swing trading opportunities to daytraders, i.e., a bounce from the lower trendline tends to present Long opportunities toward the upper trendline, and a pullback from the upper trendline could have traders open short positions toward the lower one. Again, the Bitcoin price volatility is lower enough to invalidate such intra-range setups.The most interim resistance level is near the dashed trendline in the Bitcoin chart below.A close above the dashed trendline expects to have Bitcoin test $35,000 as its next resistance target. On an extended move higher, the potential to hit $40,000 is higher based on the cryptocurrency's recent price patterns.Conversely, a pullback from the dashed trendline tends to validate a Falling Channel pattern. On the other hand, Bitcoin could retrace its steps lower towards the so-called Broadening Wedge's support trendline (next downside target near $28,500).The conflicting Bitcoin setups emerge as bulls continue to defend $30,000 as support while bears enjoy control over the $34,000-$35,000 area. Unfortunately, that has landed BTC price inside a constrained trading range, giving no interim clues about where it wants to head next.Fundamentals have played a key role in trapping Bitcoin prices. To the upside, inflationary pressures from the traditional finance sector have provided tailwinds to Bitcoin's safe-haven narrative. Meanwhile, the downside is an increasingly global regulatory discontent toward the cryptocurrency sector.Related: SEC Chairman says cryptocurrency falls under security-based swaps rulesIn the last two months, the market has witnessed China banning cryptocurrency trading, India raiding regional crypto exchange WazirX, and the U.K. banning Binance's subsidiary from operating regulated businesses. In addition, Japan and Hong Kong also issued warnings and restrictions against Binance.Earlier this week, the U.S. state authorities closed crypto company BlockFi's accounts, alleging that the startup sold unregistered securities. The sector also received criticism for increasing carbon footprints via mining, which requires heavy computational power to run blockchains.""As long as global regulation of cryptocurrencies is not eased, or a resolution is met, I believe it is difficult to gain public trust, and for Bitcoin to scale the heights it reached in early 2021,"" Adam Todd, Founder, and CEO of Digitex, told Cointelegraph.JG Collins, head of the Stuyvesant Square Consultancy, also wrote in his Seeking Alpha op-ed that ""national economics regulators, state environmental regulators, and municipalities troubled by ""mining"" raising local electrical rates will sweep cryptos away like a tsunami.""The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-24,"  Data from Delphi Digital shows holding BTC and ETH was more profitable than investing in weighted average market cap crypto and DeFi index funds. In the past two decades, index and exchange-traded funds (ETF) have become some of the most popular forms of investing because they offer investors a passive way to gain exposure to a basket of stocks as opposed to investing in individual stocks which increases risk of loss. Since 2018, this trend has extended to the crypto sector and products like the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index (BITX) tracks the total return of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), Stellar (XLM) and Uniswap (UNI). The ability to access multiple top projects through one weighted average market cap index sounds like a great way to spread out risk and gain exposure to a wider range of assets, but do these products offer investors a better return in terms of profit and protection against volatility when compared to the top-ranking cryptocurrencies?  Delphi Digital took a closer look at the performance of the Bitwise 10 and compared it to the performance of Bitcoin following the December 2018 market bottom. The results show that investing in BTC was a more profitable strategy even though BITX was slightly less volatile. According to the report, “indices aren’t meant to outperform individual assets, they’re meant to be lower-risk portfolios compared to holding an individual asset,” so it’s not surprising to see BTC outperform BITX on a purely cost basis. The index did offer less downside risk to investors as the market sold-off in May but the difference was “trivial” as “BTC’s max drawdown was 53% and Bitwise’s was 50%.” Overall, the benefits of investing in an index versus Bitcoin are not that great because the volatile nature of the crypto market and frequent large drawdowns often have a larger effect on altcoins. Delphi Digital said:Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been one of the hottest crypto sectors in 2021 led by decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (UNI) and SushiSwap (SUSHI) and lending platforms like AAVE and Compound (COMP). The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) aims to tap into this rapid growth and the DPI token has allocations to 14 of the top DeFi tokens, including UNI, SUSHI, AAVE, COMP, Maker (MKR), Synthetic (SNX) and Yearn.finance (YFI). When comparing the performance of DPI to Ether since the inception of the index, Ether significantly outperformed in terms of profitability and volatility, as evidenced by a 57% drawdown on Ether versus 65% for DPI. While this is an “imperfect comparison” according to Delphi Digital due to the fact that “the risk and volatility of DeFi tokens are higher than Ether’s,” it still highlights the point that the traditional benefits seen from indices are not mirrored by crypto-based baskets.Delphi Digital said:For the time being, Bitcoin and Ether have proven to be two of the lower-risk cryptocurrency plays available when compared to crypto index funds that offer exposure to a larger number of assets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-23,"  Bitcoin and most major altcoins are meeting resistance at higher levels but the bearish sentiment of the last two months seems to be reducing. Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery is facing resistance near $32,500, suggesting that the ride higher may not be an easy one. However, a positive sign is that demand for cryptocurrencies remains strong and lower levels continue to attract buyers.A survey of 150 family office clients of Goldman Sachs shows that 15% have already invested in crypto-assets and 45% want to take the plunge. The family offices manage more than $6 trillion in assets, meaning, even a small percentage of inflow from this sector could eventually boost crypto prices. It is not only the wealthy who are investing in cryptocurrencies. A recent survey by Gallup shows that Bitcoin ownership among U.S. investors, with $10,000 or more invested in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, has increased from 2% in 2018 to 6% as of June 2021.JPMorgan Chase may soon allow its retail wealth clients to invest in cryptocurrencies. The bank’s advisers may not be allowed to recommend crypto to their clients but they can execute trades requested by them.All this shows that investor interest in the crypto sector continues to increase. Could this result in a sustained recovery? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,569). The bulls did not give up much ground on July 22, which is a positive sign.The relative strength index (RSI) has risen to just below the midpoint, indicating that the bearish momentum is weakening. If buyers push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($34,352).This level may attract selling from the bears but if bulls can overcome the resistance and push the price above it, the relief rally could rise to $36,670. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA or the 50-day SMA, the bears will again try to sink the pair to $28,000. If they succeed, the pair could witness panic selling, clearing the path for a possible drop to $20,000.Ether’s (ETH) bounce off the critical support at $1,728.74 rose above the 20-day EMA ($2,014) on July 22. This suggests that bears may be losing their grip. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, indicating that bulls are attempting to make a comeback.The buyers will now try to challenge the 50-day SMA ($2,184) from where the previous relief rally had turned down on July 7. If the price turns down from this resistance once again, the bears will try to pull the price down to $1,728.74. A break below this support could start the next leg of the downtrend.Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will signal a possible change in trend. The pair may pick up momentum on a break above $3,000.The bears are attempting to stall the relief rally in Binance Coin (BNB) near the downtrend line but a minor positive is that bulls have not given up much ground. The altcoin formed an inside day candlestick pattern on July 22, indicating indecision among bulls and bears. If bulls drive the price above the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA ($319), it will suggest a possible change in the short-term sentiment. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to $380 and later to $433.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to pull the price down to $251.41. A break below this support will suggest that bears have absorbed the demand and the pair could then drop to the critical support at $211.70.Cardano’s (ADA) rebound off $1 is struggling to rise and sustain above $1.19. This indicates the bears have not given up and are attempting to stall the recovery at this level.If the price turns down from the current level, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $1. A bounce off this level may keep the pair range-bound between $1 and $1.19 for a few days.A breakout and close above the 20-day EMA ($1.23) will clear the path for a possible rally to the downtrend line. The pair will turn negative and start a new downtrend if bears sink and sustain the price below $1. The next support to watch on the downside is $0.80 and then $0.68.XRP’s rebound off the critical support at $0.50 has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.61). This may prove to be a difficult hurdle for the bulls to cross as the altcoin has not closed above the 20-day EMA since May 18. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $0.50. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if it cracks, the decline may extend to $0.45 and $0.40.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.70) and then to $0.75. A breakout and close above this level will suggest the start of a move back toward the downtrend line of the descending channel.Dogecoin (DOGE) formed an inside day candlestick pattern on July 22, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The sellers are aggressively defending the overhead resistance at $0.21 but the bulls are not giving up much ground.If the tight consolidation near the overhead resistance at $0.21 continues, it will indicate that bulls are not closing their positions as they anticipate a move higher. A breakout and close above $0.21 could open the doors for a move to the 50-day SMA ($0.25).Alternatively, if the bulls fail to clear the hurdle at $0.21, the DOGE/USDT pair could again drop to $0.15. If the support holds, the pair may extend its stay between $0.15 and $0.21 for a few more days. A breakdown and close below $0.15 will signal the resumption of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is $0.10.The bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above the breakdown level at $13 on July 22 but they are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($13.78). If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative.The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the DOT/USDT pair below the psychological support at $10. If they succeed, the pair could resume its downtrend and drop to the next support at $7.80.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are losing their grip. That could result in a move to the overhead resistance at $16.93. A breakout and close above this level could start a sustained relief rally to $20 and then to $26.50.Uniswap’s (UNI) rebound has risen to the 20-day EMA ($17.85) where the bears may mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative. The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the price to the strong support at $13. A breakdown and close below this support will complete the descending triangle pattern, starting the next leg of the downtrend.Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the UNI/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will invalidate the bearish setup. That could start an up-move to $25 and then $30.Related: Axie Infinity refreshes record high as AXS ascends 131% in just 3 daysThe rebound in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has reached the 20-day EMA ($461), which has acted as a stiff resistance in the past few days.

A breakdown and close below this support will indicate the resumption of the downtrend. On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to the stiff overhead resistance at $538.11.

The LTC/USDT pair may then rally to the 50-day SMA ($142) where the bears could again mount a stiff resistance. A break above this resistance may indicate the start of a stronger relief rally. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA once again, it will indicate that the sentiment remains negative. The bears will then make one more attempt to extend the down move.

2021-07-25,"  BTC price inched toward 2020's support with traders expecting more gains if a breakout occurs.  A four-day winning streak brought the Bitcoin (BTC) prices closer to testing its 50-day exponential moving average (~$35,115) as resistance.The wave, which was instrumental in strengthening Bitcoin's bullish bias across 2020 as support, flipped to become a resistance during the May 2021 sell-off. In doing so, it capped the cryptocurrency from extending its upside rebound moves many times.For instance, Bitcoin's drop from $56,900 to $30,000 in mid-May prompted bulls to buy the dip. As a result, the cryptocurrency shot back above $40,000 but found its bullish momentum exhausting right near the 50-day EMA. The scenario repeated multiple times after May's retracement attempt, as shown in the chart below.Rekt Capital, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, turned to a 2020 fractal to determine potential outcomes from the ongoing Bitcoin price action. The trader noted that Bitcoin price tested the 50-day EMA as resistance in October last year when the BTC/USD pair was trading shy of $10,000. But after breaking the wave to the upside, BTC/USD eventually established a record high near $65,000.""This [was] when BTC formed an almost identical fractal of Bitcoin's current price action,"" the profile noted, hinting that the fractal might repeat as Bitcoin tests the same resistance level after nine months.Bitcoin closed in to reclaim 50-day EMA after painting a rosy week. The benchmark cryptocurrency was off to end the seven-day session up by more than 8%. A majority of its gains came after The B-Word conference that features a trio of Wall Street biggies— Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey, and Ark Invest's founder Cathie Wood. The executives took turns to speak favorably about Bitcoin technology and shared their thoughts about the future.Musk, whose comments on cryptocurrencies are notorious for moving markets, revealed that his private rocket company SpaceX holds Bitcoin. He also added that Tesla would resume its Bitcoin payment option once its miners switch to more renewable energy sources to operate its blockchain.  Bitcoin also appeared to have capitalized on risk-on flows led by a choppy U.S. dollar index and a rising Wall Street. Next week appears busy with high-profile data and policy-statement releases. On Tuesday, the U.S. Conference Board will publish the Consumer Confidence Index for July. In addition, a preliminary Consumer Sentiment Index report from the University of Michigan shows a negative change in consumer sentiment. The report also professes fears of a sharp rise in inflation.As of late, inflationary pressures have boosted the dollar's appeal among investors. This has sapped Bitcoin's interim bullish outlook despite the cryptocurrency's popular safe-haven narrative. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its decision on interest rates and publish its monetary policy statement. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in congressional testimony earlier this month that they are still away from tapering their $120B a month bond-buying program. He commented that a decision on scaling back the Fed's asset purchases would come only upon seeing a substantial improvement in the labor market.However, the U.S. central bank officials expect to discuss whether they could start tapering by the end of this year. In detail, a hawkish shift in the Fed policy in June was partially responsible for pushing Bitcoin prices lower and the dollar higher. Therefore, Bitcoin bulls would expect to remain cautious about the potential outcome of the FOMC meeting.Related: Bitcoin bull outlines 7 steps to more fiscal stimulus and higher BTC pricesOn the other hand, if the Fed decides to sleep on the tapering talk, given the rising economic uncertainties led by the fast-spreading Delta variant of the Covid-19, it could hamper the dollar's appeal and, in turn, provide a certain degree of upside boost to Bitcoin.Thinking about thinking?Instead of thinking about tapering the Fed, running $120B in monthly QE, has actually expanded its balance sheet by $162B during just the first 3 weeks in July.Record high balance sheet = record high S&P 500.Every month since November.

2021-07-25,"  Bitcoin bulls appear to be back, but a strengthening U.S. dollar, a new wave of COVID-19 infections and low trading volumes threaten the current recovery.  The ongoing story for the past couple of months in the cryptocurrency market has been confusion on whether Bitcoin (BTC) is destined for another leg down or is finally ready to break out toward new highs.Bitcoin's price history and data from previous corrections suggest that the current struggles for the top cryptocurrency could persist for a little bit longer due to the strengthening dollar, the possibility of decreasing economic stimulus and a slew of technical factors connected to Bitcoin's price action.According to data from Delphi Digital, one of the biggest factors placing strain on risk assets around the globe is the strengthening U.S. dollar which appears to be attempting a trend reversal after falling below 90 in late May. Rising dollar strength put a halt to the year-long uptrend in the 10-year US Treasury yield which is also a reflection that the economic expansions seen in the first half of 2021 are beginning to lose steam and there is a threat that a new wave of Covid-19 infections threatening the global economic recovery.The short-term outlook for Bitcoin remains bearish as previous instances of the “Death Cross,” which appeared on BTC's chart in late June, have been followed by a corrective period that can last for nearly a year. According to the analysts at Delphi Digital, the 12-month moving average is being tested as support, and a dip below this level would signal further downside for BTC price.The 12-month moving average has been a key support level for Bitcoin historically, so how the price performs near this level could dictate whether the current uptrend remains intact. Related: El Salvadorians take to the streets to protest Bitcoin lawOverall, caution is warranted for traders because low volumes have historically led to higher volatility when fewer open bids can lead to rapid price fluctuations.  As explained by Kevin Kelly, a certified financial analyst at Delphi Digital, “the short-term outlook turns quite a bit more bearish if and when we break those key levels” near $30,000.

2021-07-24,"  Bitcoin is likely going to tackle $34,500 today or tomorrow, Michaël van de Poppe says, opening up the road to $36,000 or more. Bitcoin (BTC) touched $34,000 on July 24 after the latest resistance flip held to propel the market higher.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD just hitting the $34,000 on Bitstamp on Saturday before returning to linger around $200 lower.The past 24 hours were profitable for traders as Bitcoin launched from $32,000 to deliver 4% gains that were holding above $33,800 at the time of writing. For Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, it was necessary for the strength to continue and for $32,500 to hold in the event of a retracement.""Bitcoin breaks through that resistance at $32.5-$32.7K. Holding that for support = likely continuation towards $36K,"" he forecast in a Twitter update. Such behavior would not be at all surprising given the wide trading range in which BTC/USD is currently acting — $42,000, the point of all-time highs from February, remains the range ceiling and line in the sand for a definitive bull market continuation.Fellow trader and analyst Rekt Capital meanwhile highlighted ongoing changes with the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) as a sign of longer-timeframe bullishness returning.Last week, #BTC broke down from the triangular market structure that was formed by the 21-week EMA resistance & the 50-week EMA supportToday, $BTC is just above the 50 EMA, trying to reclaim it as supportWeekly Close above the 50 EMA will confirm the reclaim#Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/fsDm4hrK4COn the more cautious side, as Cointelegraph reported, $24,000 projections remain should Bitcoin reverse, with one trader eyeing a CME futures gap nearby as possible support.""We see support at the $22k and 24k level should there be a breakdown below the current support level,"" trading suite Decentrader added in a fresh market update on Friday.Altcoins meanwhile slowed the pace of their own gains but nontheless retained impressive performance over the week.Related: Just HODL!

2021-07-23,"  NFTs and social tokens are not Bitcoin or Ether, but interaction between celebrities and their fans raises people’s awareness about the space. After an astronomical bull run into the beginning of this year that was followed by an abrupt halt and 50% drop since April, crypto markets are at a fork in the road right now. Where they go next could inform us about how market conditions impact mainstream adoption via artists, creators and celebrities who have been taking a greater interest in the space.To date, the market for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and social tokens has been anecdotally correlated to the broader crypto market. As creators bring in more fans from outside of crypto, we’re seeing that correlation diminish, albeit with a small sample size. If Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) don’t break out of their respective slumps and we do enter a bear market, there is a strong case to be made that the growth of the creator economy will insulate social tokens from the effects of the rest of the market.Related: On the fence: If this is a crypto bear market, how long can it last?The reality is that most creators’ audiences don’t care about the price of BTC or ETH — at least not yet. They are buying tokens to unlock exclusive token-gated benefits and to interact with their favorite artists and creators in new digital and physical ways.As always, whether the next few months are bullish or bearish, both scenarios present unique opportunities for our industry. Whether the market pulls in new participants in good market conditions or shakes out the “weak hands” in a bear market, the near future presents a very pivotal time for the intersection of the creator and crypto economies.Since the crypto bull market and NFT boom took off earlier this year, creators and celebrities have taken up a great deal of space alongside Bitcoin in the mainstream conversation about crypto. Today, the NFT market has cooled significantly, and fewer big-name celebrities are cranking out NFTs like we saw in March. Does this mean that NFTs were a passing trend, or will crypto change the way that celebrities and their fans interact in the long run?There’s little doubt that a few celebrities have used crypto for easy endorsement money or to make a quick buck. But many of them are truly exploring how crypto can bring them closer to fans and using the technology to express themselves in new ways.Related: Hype is over: How NFTs and art will benefit from each other moving forwardAt the end of the day, influencers who used crypto as a “cash grab” will disappear from the space during down cycles, as have many generations of crypto tourists. We’re still talking to a lot of genuinely engaged creators about how they can incorporate NFTs into a larger-scale crypto activation with their fans. Whether they’re household-name celebrities or creators with an engaged, albeit more niche, audience, the foundation for creators and crypto has been firmly established to withstand any market conditions.It isn’t just household-name creators who are using crypto to forge deeper connections with fans and own their financial relationships instead of allowing Big Tech platforms to dictate the terms – creators with smaller and mid-sized followings have also explored ways to connect with their audiences via crypto and NFTs.The creator economy is made up of more than 50 million YouTubers, TikTok stars, bloggers and other types of content creators. The sector is growing at a breakneck pace: Ad spend on influencer marketing alone approached $10 billion last year, not to mention creators transacting directly with their fans. Within these direct creator-fan transactions, crypto is becoming more and more common.Despite the fact that the NFT market has retraced, creators are continuing to explore the space and the tech is continuing to build toward more functionality and utility. Within crypto, creators with million-dollar “market cap” economies are more common than ever. And it isn’t just creators from the cryptosphere who are successfully building crypto economies.For example, Twitch streamer Alliestrasza primarily streams card games like Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering Arena to her 225,000 subscribers. Alliestrasza has built a million-dollar economy with her community of ALLIE social token holders by engaging the token community with unique benefits like participating in fan tournaments for various games.As more creators build these kinds of economies with independent value and functions, we’ll see less and less correlation between social tokens that are designed around active community uses/engagement and the broader, more volatile crypto market that can attract more speculative participants.A lot of people who were early to crypto might question why all of this matters. Creator coins aren’t a peer-to-peer electronic cash system or a “global computer.” True, maybe they are not. But bringing new audiences into crypto and helping them understand the value of the technology is the only way to grow the space in a significant way. Crypto is still early on its adoption curve. In order to get the technology into more hands, people will either need to use the technology as it is today (which is occurring at a fairly modest pace) or the technology will have to build more user-friendly layers that are interesting to people with less interest in or knowledge of technology and finance.Related: Understanding the systemic shift from digitization to tokenization of financial servicesMeeting consumers where they are — interacting with their favorite celebrities and creators — is one of the most obvious ways to do that. But the opportunity goes beyond creators and celebrities: Imagine what the adoption curve would look like if every person, brand or website on the internet that could benefit from decentralization was tokenized.Of course, evolving regulations will play a role in the pace at which crypto and crypto-related projects are developed and adopted. This will be a key area to watch for creators and celebrities around the world, especially in the United States. And for the crypto platforms that serve creators, Financial Action Task Force compliance is already a must.Related: FATF draft guidance targets DeFi with complianceBut as the technology and regulation coalesce and crypto is adopted into the experiences that internet users are already having, billions of people will gain exposure and become more familiar with the power and potential of the technology.This could be the rising tide we’ve all been waiting for.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2021-07-23,"  The analyst also treats the latest crypto ban in China as bullish for Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin (BTC) has a better probability of recovering back to $60,000 than breaking below its current support level of $30,000 to target $20,000, believes Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.A screenshot from McGlone's latest analysis on the flagship cryptocurrency, first shared by Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, shows him comparing Bitcoin's ongoing price action with the ""too-cold"" period of the 2018–2019 trading session. In detail, the BTC/USD exchange rate entered a prolonged consolidation period near $4,000 following an 80%-plus crash in 2018, but a sudden run-up in 2019 sent its prices to as high as $14,000 on some exchanges. McGlone, who's known for his previous bullish calls on Bitcoin, noted that BTC, which has been consolidating near $30,000 since May, could post a similarly surprising rally while aiming to hit a refreshed resistance target near $60,000.""The more tactical-trading-oriented bears seem to proliferate when Bitcoin sustains at about 30% threshold below its 20-week moving average, allowing the buy-and-hold types time to accumulate,"" the strategist wrote.Bitcoin's bearish and bullish cycles appear to wobble around three key moving average indicators: the 20-week exponential moving average (20-week EMA; the green wave), which serves as interim support/resistance, the 50-week simple moving average (50-week SMA; the blue wave), and the 200-week simple moving average (20-week SMA; the orange wave).During bull trends, Bitcoin prices typically stay above the three moving averages. Meanwhile, bear trends see the cryptocurrency's prices closing below the 20-week EMA and the 50-week SMA, as shown in the chart above.The 200-week SMA typically serves as the last line of defense in a bear market. So far, Bitcoin has bottomed out twice near the orange wave, each time sending the prices explosively higher. For instance, a take-off from the 200-week SMA in 2018 drove Bitcoin prices to almost $14,000. Similarly, the wave support capped the cryptocurrency's downside attempts during the COVID-19-led crash in March 2020. Later, the price bounced from as low as $3,858 to over $65,000.Bitcoin is now in its third drop below this trendline since 2018. The cryptocurrency has broken below the 20-week SMA (near $39,000) and is now targeting the 50-week SMA (circa $32,200) as support. If the old fractal is repeated, it should continue falling toward the 200-week SMA (around $14,000).However, McGlone believes there could be an early rebound. As a bullish fundamental, the strategist pointed toward the recent China crypto ban.Beijing announced a complete ban on cryptocurrency operations in May. The decision stonewalled the mining operations in the country, which were forced to either cease or move their base outside. Bitcoin prices fell sharply in response.Nevertheless, McGlone highlighted China's rejection of open-source software crypto assets as a plateau in their economic ascent. In a tweet published Friday, the analyst attached an index showcasing booming volumes and capitalization of U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, including Tether (USDT). He then pitted the rising demand for digitized dollars against the Chinese yuan-to-dollar exchange rates, noting that the logarithmic scale of market capitalization fluctuations between the two fiat currencies was below the baseline zero between 2018 and 2020. That means the yuan was depreciating against the dollar.The scale just went back above zero, signaling interim growth for the yuan against the dollar. But its uptrend still appeared dwarfed by Tether, whose market cap rose by more than 40% above the baseline. McGlone noted:Additionally, Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of global payment network Mercuryo, noted that while the United States government has not officially launched a central bank-backed digital dollar as China has, the availability of many other alternatives — including Tether, USD Coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD) — could pose a challenge to the Chinese-controlled digital yuan.""These cryptocurrencies are pegged 1:1 against the U.S. dollar and as shown in the chart McGlone shared, the dollar is leading the digital rise over the Chinese Yuan,"" Kozyakov said.However, rejecting McGlone's take, Yuriy Mazur of CEX.IO Broker noted that the Chinese economy should continue flourishing with or without cryptocurrencies, saying that it has nothing to do with the demand for digital assets.Related: US–China trade war and its effect on cryptocurrencies""The Chinese government is too smart to miss out on something the world deems valuable,"" Mazur told Cointelegraph.

2021-07-22,"  Bulls managed to find some momentum, but holding the $32,000 support level will determine who is the victor of Friday’s $330-million BTC options expiry. This Friday’s weekly Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry currently holds $330 million in open interest. Considering the recent struggle to regain the $32,000 support level, this event is an important test of bulls’ willingness to display reversion signs.On Wednesday, Alameda Research announced that it had made Bitcoin purchases below $30,000, and Sam Trabucco, the firm’s quantitative trader, mentioned that the narrative for BTC could turn bullish because of the ongoing fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) caused by the China BTC mining ban, Grayscale GBTC unlock and recovery in stock markets.The chart above shows that the current downtrend channel, initiated three weeks ago, might be invalidated if the price breaks the $32,200 resistance. The move seems to have been sparked by Elon Musk’s statement that his firm SpaceX also holds Bitcoin. During the Wednesday meet-up with Cathie Wood and Jack Dorsey, Musk said that despite the rumors, he completely opposes recent speculations that Tesla has been selling some of its Bitcoin position.Elon Musk clarifies Tesla hasn't sold bitcoin after sparking sell-off https://t.co/jPxK5jBm3m pic.twitter.com/4uA5xB8OwBIt is worth noting that the rumors had some backing only because Musk gave conflicting signals on social networks. Moreover, Tesla had sold 10% of its Bitcoin holdings in the previous month.Friday’s options expiry might be the first strength test of this recent bounce. If bulls want to set $32,000 as a support level, there’s no better way than causing the most damage possible to the neutral-to-bearish put (sell) options.The first signal that bears have been trying to dominate is the put-to-call ratio. The 0.81 reading reflects a smaller amount of neutral-to-bullish call (buy) options for Friday, July 23’s, expiry.However, bears might have set themselves a trap because 96% of the put options used $32,000 or lower strike prices. If Bitcoin manages to stay above that level at 8:00 am UTC on Friday, only $8 million in put options will take part in the expiry.Related: Bitcoin price hits $32K but derivatives metrics still show signs of weaknessOn the other hand, there is $29 million worth of call options up to the $32,000 strike price. This $21-million difference favors bulls. Albeit small, it is completely opposite from an expiry below $32,000. If $32,000 fails to hold, bears will have a $9-million lead because only 9% of the call options have been placed at $31,000 or lower. Neither outcome is of extreme significance, but the profits could be used for the larger upcoming monthly options expiry on July 30. This is the primary reason why bulls need to hold their ground to keep the current momentum.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-22,"  The cryptocurrency market recovered on Thursday after renewed endorsements from Elon Musk at “The ₿ Word” conference on Wednesday. Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), rebounded sharply on Thursday after Elon Musk disclosed for the first time that his private rocket firm, SpaceX, holds Bitcoin (BTC) and that Tesla would probably resume the Bitcoin payments option for its electric cars.The BTC/USD exchange rate was below $30,000 but bounced by more than 5% after the big reveal, touching an intraday high of $32,895. Ether, which tends to move in lockstep with Bitcoin, surged likewise. It reclaimed $2,000 on Wednesday, rising by as much as 18.20% from its week-to-date low of $1,720.Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer of financial services company Bitpanda, told Cointelegraph in an email statement that Ethereum would continue tailing Bitcoin in the coming sessions.“As soon as the ‘big brother’ finds its support level,” he added, “Ethereum will most likely follow suit.”The latest bounce in the Ether market also originated from a support level that had earlier capped Ether’s downside attempts. Pseudonymous independent market analyst Rekt Capital flashed a so-called “orange area” on a weekly ETH/USD chart, illustrating three bearish wicks and their ability to shield the pair from falling lower.“ETH has rallied +16% since rebounding from the orange area,” the analyst explained, coupling the price floor with a support trendline that apprehensively constituted a Falling Wedge.In detail, Falling Wedges are bullish reversal patterns that start wide at the top but start contracting as the prices move lower, forming a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. A bullish confirmation comes when the price breaks above the Wedge’s upper trendline with a spike in volumes. In doing so, bulls place their upside profit target as high as the maximum wedge height.Ether prices almost check all the boxes when it comes to trading inside a Falling Wedge pattern. Rekt Capital highlighted the same in a chart he published Thursday.“As long as ETH holds the bottom of the structure as support until the end of the week, [it] will confirm a return to the structure after briefly losing it earlier this week,” added Rekt Capital.The maximum distance between the Wedge’s upper and lower trendline is roughly $850. Therefore, according to the classic technical setup, a breakout above the upper trendline could send the prices to at least $2,500.Related: Decoupling ahead? Bitcoin and Ethereum may finally snap their 36-month correlationNonetheless, the prices still risk falling sharply below $2,000, based on a short-term technical setup, as shown in the chart below.The daily Ether chart shows the price could fluctuate between $1,850 and $2,080 before the potential bullish breakout, noted Rekt Capital.Charles Kirkpatrick and Julie Dahlquist’s book Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians notes that Falling Wedges have a failure rate of just 8%–11%. Moreover, the possibility of a bearish breakout has a higher failure rate of 15%–24%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-22,"  Bitcoin and Ethereum have been majorly trading in sync since 2018, increasing risk exposure of crypto-only investment portfolios.  Anish Saxena, a New Delhi-based automobile dealer, made “incredible” profits by investing in cryptocurrencies in 2020, just as his business took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic-induced lockdown.“I had known about Bitcoin and Ethereum and dozens of other assets for years,” the 33-year old businessman said. “But I only got to invest in them after the lockdown pushed me and my family members out of work. And it helped us survive — big time.”Saxena revealed that he had allocated about 80% of his investment portfolio to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with the rest of his capital distributed across Polygon, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Chainlink’s LINK. His crypto-only investment netted him great profits, the numbers of which Saxena declined to reveal. However, he did notice how he almost got half of his unrealized profits wiped by deciding not to liquidate ahead of the May 2021 crash.“I was liquidating cryptocurrencies based on my household demand for cash,” Saxena said. “While I am still in profits, seeing my profits decline by more than 50% has prompted me to get a huge portion of my investments back into cash.”Retail traders like Saxena have come under pressure due to over-reliance on the two most predominant cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ether. While different in terms of economics and use cases, both digital assets tend to move in the same direction. In recent history, their losses and profits appeared well-synced, illustrating that their holders might see their investments grow rapidly during bull trends but, at the same time, risk losing a lot when the uptrend exhausts and reverses to the bearish side.“If it is a pure crypto portfolio, then, of course, having two cryptos which are highly correlated with one another adds risk to the portfolio,” said Simon Peters, a crypto analyst at multi-asset brokerage company eToro.On the other hand, Liam Bussell, head of corporate communications at fiat-to-crypto gateway provider Banxa, called Bitcoin and Ether liquidity backstops for crypto traders. In his comments to Cointelegraph, the executive said that traders utilize their initial gains in the top two cryptocurrency markets to invest in mid and lower-cap digital assets, citing rallies in Dogecoin and across nonfungible token projects. He noted:Additionally, Peters advised traders and investors to counterbalance their crypto investment risks by allocating a good portion of their capital in traditional financial instruments, including stocks, commodities, and fixed-income securities/funds.“Historically, crypto has shown itself to be pretty uncorrelated to other asset classes and offers better risk-adjusted returns,” the analyst explained.Peters, meanwhile, reminded that the Ethereum network’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake — known as Ethereum 2.0 — might limit its correlation with Bitcoin.In detail, one of the principal features included in the upcoming Ethereum blockchain upgrade, called Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, is deflation and intends to burn a portion of transaction fees collected from users. That could wipe out at least 1 million ETH tokens every year from the circulating supply, thus making the asset scarcer, according to crypto education publication Coinmonks. Bitcoin exhibits a similar scarcity by reducing its newly issued supply rate by half every four years, a process called a halving. The cryptocurrency has a limited supply cap of 21 million tokens.Related: London fork enters testnet on Ethereum as difficulty bomb sees delay“It’s possible that a decoupling could occur between bitcoin and ether following the completion of the transition to 2.0, as the ‘tokenomics’ — how ETH works on the 2.0 blockchain — will be different to at present,"" said Peters, adding:As for Saxena, the novice trader said he would “hodl” on to a portion of his BTC and ETH.“If business picks up again after a full economy reopening, I’m planning to invest consistently across Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold and mutual funds,” he noted.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-22,"  Ranging continues for BTC/USD, but conditions may be right for a late surge to range highs above $40,000. Bitcoin (BTC) circled $32,000 on Thursday after excitement over fresh comments by Elon Musk resulted in the strengthening of support.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD ranging between $31,500 and $32,000 overnight on Wednesday hours after Musk joined others in praising Bitcoin during a conference panel.As Cointelegraph reported, Musk’s words came over broadly positive and less critical than many had assumed they would be — this, in turn, led to a brief price surge that topped out above $32,800.Thereafter, familiar resistance kicked in, and $32,400 once more became the level to flip, a feat that Bitcoin has yet to achieve.Nonetheless, previous gains from below $30,000 remained intact, and there was equally little evidence of a major retracement about to kick in on Thursday.“If we look at the price action of Bitcoin, we can clearly see and state that we’re holding above $31K,” Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe said. Independent analyst and trader Keith Wareing was neutral about the Musk episode. He argued that since no resistance levels had truly cracked, nothing had fundamentally changed in the short-term BTC price landscape.Elon pump (yay)Rejected bang on, literally bang fucking on the handle (booo)But TA is a load of bullshit so it means nothing right?Wake me up when we break and close above $42300, otherwise it’s still chopsville pic.twitter.com/58V1cO0txqAs such, buy and sell positions among traders likewise continued their trend from earlier in the week — with the addition of $33,000 slowly forming a resistance zone and support conversely stepping in at $31,000.Altcoins likewise cemented gains which commonly ranged between 5% and 10% on the day.Related: Altcoins secure double-digit gains after Bitcoin surges toward $33K Dogecoin (DOGE), which began its run-up ahead of Musk’s appearance, traded still below $0.20 at the time of writing, with daily returns nearing a more modest 8%.Van de Poppe added that a scenario under which Bitcoin rises to range resistance at $40,000 or higher would have a much more pronounced impact on altcoin markets.“This would lead altcoins to run 80-150% from here,” he forecast.Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, was back at $2,000, launching away from support levels after briefly losing its 2021 higher lows trend earlier in the week."
2021-07-22,"  As layer-two scaling matures for Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin urges the community to grow beyond the confines of DeFi. During his keynote at the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, Ethereum co-founder and lead developer Vitalik Buterin implored the Ethereum community to innovate beyond the confines of decentralized finance (DeFi).Describing non-financial utilities as “the most interesting part of the vision of general-purpose blockchains,” Buterin lamented that financial applications currently “dominate the Ethereum space.”Buterin outlines several non-financial applications for Ethereum, including decentralized social media, identity verification and attestation, and retroactive public goods funding.“Moving beyond DeFi is not about being against DeFi. I actually think [...] the most interesting Ethereum applications are going to combine elements of finance and non-finance,” said Buterin.“Maybe a few years from now we’ll have a lot of really exciting things [...] that are just providing all kind of very diverse and real value to all kinds of people, not just within the Ethereum ecosystem but also going far beyond it as well,” he added.Buterin has already begun working on public goods funding. In a Wednesday blog post co-authored by Buterin, layer-two scaling solution Optimism pledged to fund open-source development through a retroactive rewards protocol, committing all profits generated through sequencing to the initiative. Buterin attributes the Ethereum community’s preoccupation with DeFi to two main factors.Firstly, Buterin asserted that “finance is just the area where centralized technology sucks the most,” concluding that finance offers a larger domain for decentralization than other centralized industries:Buterin also emphasized the prevalence of high fees in pushing the sector toward financial applications, noting:However, Buterin offered that the challenge of high transaction fees “is now being solved” by Ethereum’s growing ecosystem of layer-two networks.Related: Bitcoin falls to sixth for daily revenue, with just 12% of Ethereum’s feesWith work to mitigate transaction costs on Ethereum currently underway, Buterin asserted that now is the time to begin exploring how Ethereum can be used to tackle other issues, stating, “The Ethereum ecosystem has to expand beyond just making tokens that help with trading other tokens.”“If you just take this narrow thing that is DeFi, and you keep pushing it to infinity, [...] you’re just gonna get tokens that give you profit from yield farming other currencies that are financial derivatives between other yield farming tokens,” he said. Despite noting that financial derivatives offer some value to the sector, Buterin warned of the systemic risk associated with complex derivative products, concluding, “Let’s not just do DeFi.”"
2021-07-21,"  TEL, MATIC and AXS soared higher as Bitcoin’s relief rally to $32,800 lifted the entire market. Charts turned green as Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied to $32,858, but a number of analysts also cautioned that the market may not be out of the woods yet. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the top movers over the past 24-hours were Telcoin (TEL), Polygon (MATIC) and Axie Infinity (AXS), indicating that the recovery is widespread and not just confined to large-cap cryptocurrencies. As seen in the list above, the top-performing tokens represent a variety of cryptocurrency subsectors, including nonfungible tokens, artificial intelligence and decentralized finance projects.Telcoin (TEL), a blockchain protocol focused on sending and receiving mobile-based global remittances, was the top performer over the past 24-hours. TEL rallied 71% from a low of $0.0091 on July 20 to an intraday high at $0.0158 to as its 24-hour trading volume surged 136% to $43 million. Interest in the project received a noticeable uptick following the introduction of “DeFi agents” on the Fetch protocol, which are designed to help users manage their liquidity and protect it from impermanent loss or rug pulls. The second-best performing token on the 24-hour charts is Polygon (MATIC), the popular layer-two solution for the Ethereum (ETH) network that has seen a significant increase in adoption over the first half of 2021. VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for MATIC on July 20, prior to the recent price rise. The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for MATIC first turned green on July 19 and climbed to a high of 77 on July 20 as its price reached a low of $0.62, just one hour before its price rallied 52% over the next 29 hours. The surging momentum for Polygon is in large part due to the release of Polygon Studios, the protocol’s “new arm for the blockchain gaming and NFT ecosystem.” Related: Trading firm of richest crypto billionaire reveals buying ‘a lot more’ Bitcoin below $30KThe third-best performer over the past 24-hours was Axie Infinity (AXS), an NFT-focused protocol that rallied more than 1,000% over the past month thanks to soaring user activity and the income opportunities it offers users in economically disadvantaged countries. According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for AXS have been favorable for some time. As seen in the chart above VORTECS™ Score for AXS has been elevated for the majority of the past week and reached a high of 77 on July 20, around one hour before the price increased 46% over the next sixteen hours. Currently, AXS price trades at $18. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-21,"  The strong recovery in Bitcoin and altcoins shows there is aggressive buying at lower levels but bears are unlikely to give up without a fight.  Bitcoin (BTC) is leading the recovery in crypto markets today after the price rallied back above the $32,000 level. Sam Trabucco, a quantitative trader at Alameda Research, said the firm had purchased the dip in Bitcoin on July 20. Trabucco said the sharp recovery in equity markets, fewer long liquidations in the crypto derivatives market and the possible end of FUD caused due to China mining ban and Grayscale unlocking could act as recovery catalysts that could boost the crypto rally further.However, analyst and podcast host Nebraskan Gooner views the recovery in Bitcoin as a shorting opportunity. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also expects Bitcoin to witness another downturn before a change in trend.The correction may open up opportunities for several new investors to enter the crypto markets. JPMorgan director of asset and wealth management Mary Callahan Erdoes said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that several of the bank’s clients want to invest in Bitcoin because they consider it as an asset class.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the levels where resistance may creep in.Aggressive selling by the bears pulled the price below $31,000 on July 19 and that was followed by another down move on July 20. However, the bulls purchased the dip below $30,000 today, resulting in a strong rebound.The bears will try to stall the recovery at the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,643). If the price turns down from this resistance, the sellers will again try to sink the BTC/USDT pair below the critical support at $28,000.If they succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend that could pull the price down to $20,000.Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could challenge the 50-day simple moving average ($34,599). A break above this resistance will be the first sign of strength and open the doors for a possible rally to $36,670.The long tail on the July 20 candlestick suggests that bulls purchased the dip to the strong support at $1,728.74. This is the third instance when Ether (ETH) has rebounded off this level since May 23.The rebound has gained momentum today and the buyers will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,008). If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,213) which could act as a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the bears will again try to pull the price below $1,728.74. If they manage to do that, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend that may reach $1,536.92.The buyers will have to clear the hurdle at the downtrend line to signal a possible change in trend.Binance Coin (BNB) has bounced off the $251.41 support today which is a positive sign. This suggests that bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.The buyers will now try to push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that bears are losing their grip. The BNB/USDT pair could then start its journey toward the overhead resistance at $433.Conversely, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. The sellers will then again attempt to pull the price down to the critical support at $211.70. A break below this support could complete a bearish descending triangle pattern and start the next leg of the downtrend.Cardano (ADA) plunged to the critical support at $1 on July 20 but the bulls aggressively purchased this dip, resulting in a strong rebound today. The relief rally could now reach the 20-day EMA ($1.25) where bears may offer a stiff resistance. If bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA. If the momentum clears this hurdle, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will invalidate the bearish descending triangle pattern, which could open the doors for a rally to $1.94.Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again try to sink the pair below $1. If that happens, panic selling may ensue and the pair could start its downward journey to $0.80 and then to $0.68.XRP has bounced off the critical support at $0.50 today, indicating that bulls are attempting to defend this level aggressively. The rebound could rise to the 20-day EMA ($0.61), which is likely to act as a stiff hurdle.If the price once again turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to pull the price below the $0.50 support.If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair could resume the downtrend. The next support is at $0.45 and then $0.40. Alternatively, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bears are losing their grip. The pair may then rise to the overhead resistance at $0.75.Dogecoin (DOGE) has once again bounced off the $0.15 support today, suggesting that bulls are aggressively attempting to defend this level. The relief rally could now reach the overhead resistance at $0.21.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate that bears will try to stall the rally at $0.21. If the price turns down from this resistance, the DOGE/USDT pair could again drop to $0.15 and remain range-bound for a few days.A breakout of $0.21 will be the first sign of strength and could result in a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.26). On the contrary, if the price turns down and plummets below $0.15, the pair may witness panic selling and could drop to $0.10.Polkadot (DOT) plummeted near the psychological level at $10 on July 20 where buying emerged. This has resulted in a strong recovery today.The buyers may face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($14). If the price turns down from this resistance, bears will again attempt to sink the DOT/USDT pair below $10. If they succeed, the downtrend could extend to $7.80.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could move up to the 50-day SMA ($17.82). A breakout and close above this resistance will signal a possible change in trend.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the overhead resistance at $16.93 on July 19 and started its southward march toward the next critical support at $13 but the bulls had other plans. They purchased at lower levels today, resulting in a strong recovery.The up-move could face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($17.89). If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears may fancy their chances and will again try to sink the UNI/USDT pair below $13.If they succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend and slide to the psychological support at $10. Conversely, if bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may reach the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance will indicate that bears are losing their grip.Related: It is time for the US to create a ‘Ripple test’ for cryptoBitcoin Cash (BCH) dropped to $383.53 on July 20 from where it is attempting to start a relief rally. This suggests that bulls are accumulating at lower levels.The pullback could reach the 20-day EMA ($465) where bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the sellers will make one more attempt to sink the BCH/USDT pair below $370.If they manage to do that, the decline could extend to the next support at $330. On the other hand, if bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rally to the overhead resistance at $538.11. Litecoin (LTC) plunged below the $118 support on July 19, completing a bearish descending triangle pattern. The decline had pushed the RSI into oversold territory, suggesting that selling was overdone in the short term.The LTC/USDT pair has started a recovery today and may retest the breakdown level at $118. If bears flip this level into resistance, the pair could make one more attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below the $100 psychological support could start the next leg of the down move that may reach $70.On the contrary, if bulls push and sustain the price above $118, the pair could climb up to the 20-day EMA ($127) where bears may again try to stall the relief rally. If they succeed, the pair could again turn down but if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, a rally to the 50-day SMA ($145) is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-21,"  Bitcoin price rallied 8.5% to recover the $32,000 level, but derivatives data shows pro traders still feel apprehensive. There's no doubt that the last couple of months have been bearish for Bitcoin (BTC), but throughout this entire period, derivatives indicators have been relatively neutral. This could be because cryptocurrencies have a strong track record of volatility, and even 55% corrections from all-time highs are expected.After two months of struggling to sustain the $30,000 support and finally losing it on July 20, the futures premium and options skew turned bearish. Even PlanB's stock-to-flow valuation model was not expecting prices below $30,000 for the current month. The model uses the stock-to-flow ratio, which is defined by the current number of Bitcoin in circulation and the yearly issuance of newly mined Bitcoin. On-chain analytics show that the monthly average of 36,000 BTC withdrawn from exchanges is usually interpreted as accumulation. However, this superficial analysis fails to acknowledge the increased use of tokenized Bitcoin in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.The chart above shows that 40,660 BTC have been added to Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and RenBTC (RENBTC) over the past three months. This number does not consider deposits at BlockFi, Nexo, Len and the multiple services that provide yield on user's cryptocurrency deposits.Removing Bitcoin previously deposited on exchanges could be a sign that traders' intent to sell in the short term is reduced. Still, at the same time, it might also represent investors seeking higher returns in other avenues. In short, these coins might have been sitting on exchanges as collateral or as a long-term holding.As previously mentioned, derivatives indicators flipping negative should hold more weight than assumptions on the bullish or bearish interpretation of on-chain data. In an initial analysis, analysts should review the futures contracts premium, which is also known as the basis.This indicator allows investors to understand how bullish or bearish professional traders are because it measures the difference between monthly futures contracts and the current spot market price.A neutral basis rate should be between 7% to 15% annualized. This price difference is caused by sellers demanding more money to postpone settlement, a situation known as contango. However, when this premium fades or turns negative, this is a very bearish scenario known as backwardation. July 20 was the first time that the indicator sustained a negative 2.5% level for longer than twelve hours.At the moment, professional traders are likely leaning bearish after Bitcoin lost the critical $30,000 support, but further confirmation can be gained from looking at options markets. Related: Here's one way to trade Bitcoin even as BTC price teeters over an abyssUnlike futures contracts, there are two different instruments in options. Call options provide the buyer with upside price protection, and the put option is a right to sell Bitcoin at a fixed price in the future. Put options are generally used in neutral-to-bearish strategies.Whenever the put-to-call ratio increases, it means the open interest on these neutral-to-bearish contracts is growing, and it is usually interpreted as a negative signal. The most recent data at 0.66 still favors the call options, but these instruments gradually lose ground.Currently, there's enough evidence of bearishness in the futures and options markets, and this hasn't been the case over the past two months. This suggests that even pro traders lack confidence after the $30,000 support failed to hold in the past 48-hours.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-21,"  Bitcoin is likely not out of the woods until a definitive bottom formation has been and gone, multiple commentators say. Bitcoin (BTC) continued its bounce from its 2021 opening price on Wednesday, hitting $31,600 in what some fear is just a temporary reprieve from the downside.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it gained a respectable 7% during Wednesday.Bulls had successfully defended the largest cryptocurrency against further losses at just above $29,000 — the price at which the market began the year.As Cointelegraph reported, however, concern is running high over current strength being a “relief rally” — not a true comeback after a price floor.“It’s still ‘short the bounce’ season,” popular analyst and podcast host Nebraskan Gooner summarized to Twitter followers.Veteran trader Peter Brandt concurred, suggesting that Bitcoin would need another shock leg down before the genuine return to form kicked in.l think your chart may be propheticThe latest spot volatility comes as Bitcoin network fundamentals delight market participants — these showing ever-increasing strength this month.The hash rate was nearing 100 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the time of writing, edging closer to all-time highs of 168 EH/s from before the infamous China mining rout.“Bitcoin network fundamentals have never looked better,” MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor declared Tuesday.Difficulty, meanwhile, was still on track to increase at its next readjustment despite the price dip.In altcoins, a welcome reversal of fortunes was still in play — many of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization saw daily gains of nearly 10%.Related: Bitcoin bull outlines 7 steps to more fiscal stimulus and higher BTC pricesA standout was Dogecoin (DOGE), which put in 14% returns ahead of proponent Elon Musk’s discussion at Wednesday’s “The B Word” conference. Crypto players more broadly will be watching for cues from the event, which features Musk in discussion with Ark CEO Cathie Wood and Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and payment company Square."
2021-07-20,"  The 50-week simple moving average earlier offered incredible support for Bitcoin's long-term bullish bias, but bears convincingly took it during the June 19 sell-off. Bitcoin (BTC) prices broke below a long-standing support wave that was instrumental in keeping its strong bullish bias intact after March 2020's crypto market crash.Dubbed the 50-week simple moving average, or 50-week SMA, the wave represents the average price traders have paid for Bitcoin over the past 50 weeks. Over the years, and in 2020, its invalidation as price floor has contributed to pushing the Bitcoin market into severe bearish cycles.For instance, the 50-week SMA acted as support during the 2018 bear market. The wave helped prevent Bitcoin from undergoing deeper downtrends — between February 2018 and May 2018 — as its price corrected from the then-record high of $20,000.Similarly, the wave provided Bitcoin with incredible support during its correction from its $15,000 high in 2019. Moreover, it held well as a price floor until March 2020, when the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global market crash.Pseudonymous chartist ""Bitcoin Master"" shared concerns about Bitcoin's potential to undergo an 80% average price decline upon breaking bearish on its 50-day SMA. The analyst noted that if the said fractal plays out, BTC/USD exchange rates could crash to as low as $13,000.#Bitcoin just tagged the 50-week simple moving average, let's see if the coin doesn't break tradition of bouncing at least 50% ($47k) from it before making the usual 80% decline ($13k) from ATH.#bitcoin dropping after the weekly candle opened below the structure I’ve been watching for a few weeks now. I expect a bounce between $24k - $29k largely due to the CME gap at $24615.  After that, my guess at a bear market bottom would be $12k give or take $2k either side. pic.twitter.com/aMi2M45bmfMeanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence's senior commodity strategist, Mike McGlone, also highlighted the 50-week SMA in a tweet earlier in July, albeit recalling the wave's ability to withhold selling pressure. The analyst recommended that investors should not dump their Bitcoin holdings right away on initial dips below the wave.""Selling Bitcoin on initial dips below its 50-week moving average in the past has proven a good way to lose money, even in bear markets,"" McGlone explained.The latest Bitcoin dip came in the wake of a global risk-on market decline driven by fears that the highly transmissible Delta variant of COVID-19 would slow down the recovery generated by the reopening of economies.Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, noted that Bitcoin could drop further. In comments to Bloomberg, the former Google executive said the BTC/USD exchange rates could fall to as low as $20,000. Nonetheless, he anticipated the pair to retest $40,000 on the next bounce.“We’re going to need to form another base first before resuming another bull trend,” Ayyar noted. Jehan Chu, the founder of cryptocurrency-focused venture capital and trading firm Kenetic Capital, placed a safe downside target near $25,000 but warned about accelerated sell-offs should bulls fail to log a rebound from the level. He said: However, another analyst offered a different, more optimistic perspective on the current position of Bitcoin. James Wo, founder  CEO of the global crypto investment firm Digital Finance Group, highlighted on-chain indicators, including an ongoing decline in exchange inflows and active wallet addresses, as a reason to stay bullish on Bitcoin.""Looking at these on-chain indicators, we can say that the majority of investors are waiting for major signals to enter the market again,"" Wo told Cointelegraph.Related: Bitcoin bull outlines 7 steps to more fiscal stimulus and higher BTC pricesData provided by CryptoQuant, a South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm, also provided a bullish setup for Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency's market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio.In detail, the MVRV ratio represents an asset's market capitalization divided by realized capitalization. When the figure is too high, traders may interpret Bitcoin's price as being overvalued, thereby implying selling pressure. On the other hand, when the MVRV value is too low, traders may treat Bitcoin prices as undervalued, implying buying pressure.""Buying [Bitcoin] at this same level in the past cycle was seen between January to March 2017,"" noted one of the CryptoQuant analysts, adding: The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-20,"  BTC is back at square one when it comes to this year's bull market, but unparalleled bids are doing their best to halt any further losses. Bitcoin (BTC) breaking below $30,000 has cost it almost all of its 2021 bull run gains — but a historic silver lining is ready to rescue bulls.Data from crypto exchange Binance's order book confirms that BTC/USD has almost dipped to the strongest support zone ever seen.It has been a rough 24 hours for Bitcoin hodlers, and the rout doesn't seem to be over yet. After losing 6% overnight, BTC/USD hit lows of $29,300 — $300 below where it opened at the start of the year.With that, despite reaching lofty highs of $64,500 just three months ago, Bitcoin is de facto back where it started before the most intense phase of its latest bull run kicked in.Those who fear that all is lost — at least for the short term — may be happy to discover that that same level currently hosts the biggest Bitcoin ""bid"" ever seen.As revealed on July 20 by ""Material Scientist,"" the creator of monitoring resource Material Indicators, BTC/USD is now being propped up by unprecedented demand.""We just hit the largest bid ever,"" Material Scientist summarized.The idea of Bitcoin breaking below current levels is, nevertheless, far from fantasy for traders, with predictions of $24,000 or even a $14,000 ""Armageddon scenario"" circulating online.Additional order book data from Binance shows relatively little resistance between the spot price and $35,000, something that could make a rebound easier to engineer.At the time of publication, Bitcoin circled $29,700 as relative stability returned to the market.Meanwhile, the latest figures covering investor activity around Bitcoin have produced some surprising results.As noted by statistician Willy Woo on July 20, it is now the smaller hodlers who are amassing BTC, even as the largest whales divest themselves of their holdings.Related: Rothschild Investment Corp has increased its Bitcoin exposure by 300% since April""Wee little fishies are going parabolic,"" he commented.This makes 2021 look more akin to 2013 than 2017 in terms of post-halving bull run years, a common narrative in recent weeks."
2021-07-20,"  Plan B’s stock-to-flow model is the closest it’s ever been to being invalidated as Bitcoin stagnates in the $30,000 range. As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle around the $30,000 mark, the widely accepted stock-to-flow (S2F) model to price Bitcoin, coined by Twitter user and unnamed Dutch investor Plan B, is now the farthest from its estimates. The model was popularized by the Twitter pseudonym more than two years ago in March 2019 and amid a minor bull through Q1 2019. It’s considered to be one of the leading quantitative valuations for the first-ever scarce digital currency. The model presumes that scarcity of certain assets or commodities drives its price.The S2F model is an attempt to price Bitcoin in a way similar to scarce commodities, such as gold, silver, etc. The essence of it is that assets like Bitcoin, gold and silver have only limited supply injections in a certain period of time when compared with commodities like oil, copper and steel, where the supply flow is higher and considered to be theoretically limitless. Since Bitcoin has a maximum supply limited to 21 million tokens and considering the time- and energy-intensive mining process, there is only a certain number of new Bitcoin that can come into circulation in a certain timeframe. The premium cryptocurrency had fit right into this model, until now. Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin Global — a cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph:He went on to say that models like these are usually built on historical data and that while some periodic trends can help identify the general direction of the market, specific trends can often be difficult to track in advance.According to the S2F model, BTC’s price is supposed to be at $88,531 on July 20, which is nearly three times the current price. In fact, earlier this year, PlanB suggested that Bitcoin could hit $450,000 before the end of this year in the best-case scenario, and $135,000 in the “worst-case scenario.“ Furthermore, the model predicts that Bitcoin is expected to have hit its much-awaited $1 million mark in July 2025.However, in a PlanB Twitter poll on June 21, 41% of respondents thought that Bitcoin would remain under $100,000 this year.This is compared to the 16% that believed the same back in March when Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $55,000. PlanB went on to say that Bitcoin prices deviating from the S2F model make even him feel “a bit uneasy.”The model, as the name would suggest, uses the stock-to-flow ratio to value Bitcoin. This ratio is defined by the current number of Bitcoin in circulation at a given time and the incoming flow of newly mined Bitcoin. As evident in the chart describing the model, historically, Bitcoin has traced the price estimates in a fairly accurate fashion at most times.As pointed out by Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, the negative S2F deflection — the ratio between the market price of Bitcoin and the S2F ratio — is now the highest it has ever been in the history of the token. He went on to say that for believers in the S2F model, this is a great time to buy Bitcoin, as this price drop could be perceived as an unexpected dip.Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, spoke with Cointelegraph on the limitations of the S2F model, saying: One of the major changes in the past year for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets as a whole is the high rates of institutional and retail adoption that have drastically increased since March 2019. Another important factor in this demand and adoption dynamic is the COVID-19 pandemic that has plagued the world for more than 19 months now. Lai elaborated more on this, saying:The Musk effect, combined with various other factors, such as the mainstream popularity of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), has played a large role in raising awareness about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general. Lyu touched upon this changing scenario in the cryptocurrency market as well, saying, “The emerging projects and altcoins on the market with diversified application scenarios will distract investor attention and diversify their existing investment portfolios, thus continuously fluctuating the Bitcoin market.” This change is evident in the fact that, since the beginning of this year, Bitcoin’s dominance as the premier cryptocurrency has fallen from over 60% to its current 46.3%, signifying a growing altcoin sector.In a recent example of the shift in demand and adoption dynamic since the inception of the S2F model, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) recently underwent several share unlockings across July, with the biggest on July 18. This expiry further increased the continual downward pressure on Bitcoin, causing it to drop further to trading around $30,500 on July 19, dropping from nearly $32,200 on July 18 before the expiry. In the past — when the S2F model initially became prevalent — there wasn't institutional demand that could heavily impact the market in a short amount of time.While the S2F model is one of the most widely known quantitative models that predicts Bitcoin’s price in the short term (less than five years), there are several other models that are often used to gauge its price potential. Daniele Bernardi, founder of the PHI Token project and CEO of Diaman Partners Ltd. — a fintech asset management company — explored some of these models in a recent paper. Bernardi evaluated the inadequacies of the S2F model, stating to Cointelegraph:Instead, Bernardi prefers the rate of adoption model, which he explores in his paper. He stated that, according to this model, the “fair price” of Bitcoin can be around $60,000, but not more than that. This estimate is based on the “actual users of Bitcoin and the wallets created.” He went on to explain the probability of PlanB’s S2F model actually coming into fruition this year: “Of course, anything can happen, but from my point of view, there is less than 20% of probability, based on Monte-Carlo simulations, that the Bitcoin price will reach a value greater than $100,000 in 2021.”Related: Forecasting Bitcoin price using quantitative models, Part 3That said, it is important to remember that Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $18,000 for a few days in the March 2017 bull run and went straight to trading at $64,000 in March 2021. There are not many assets in financial markets that have witnessed gains at these levels within such a short time span. Bernardi explained the impact of this growth:Fair value or not, Bitcoin seems to be in a period of turmoil, more often than not facing downward pressure on the token since the flash crash on “Black Wednesday” n May. However, positive institutional news keeps flooding in. Most recently, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said that Grayscale is “100% committed” to turn GBTC into a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund."
2021-07-20,"  Ether continues to trade lower under the shadow of Bitcoin in days leading up to its supply-crunching hard fork event. Ether (ETH) prices slid on Tuesday in tandem with Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop below $30,000.The ETH/USD exchange rate dropped 5.41% to an intraday low of $1,720 — or roughly $400 above its 2018 all-time high price — which should serve as an important psychological support level. The pair’s bid had climbed to as high as $1,994 on the Coinbase exchange on Sunday. Meanwhile, its price action looked strikingly similar to Bitcoin’s, the flagship cryptocurrency that topped at $32,450 on Sunday but later corrected to as low as $29,507 during the Tuesday session.The plunge also followed the Ethereum network’s co-founder Anthony Di Iorio’s exit from the cryptocurrency industry partially because of personal safety concerns. Di Iorio, who’s likely a large Ether holder, hinted to Bloomberg in an exclusive interview that he would liquidate his entire crypto-related holdings, without specifically mentioning the Ethereum blockchain’s native token.“[Crypto is] really a small percentage of what the world needs,” he said, adding that he wants “to diversify to not being a crypto guy, but being a guy tackling complex problems.”The latest bout of sell-off surfaced despite Ethereum’s upcoming network upgrade. Dubbed as the London hard fork, the major code update is another step toward turning Ethereum into a speedier and scalable proof-of-stake network from an energy-intensive proof-of-work one.But the most talked-about feature in the upcoming hard fork is deflation. The upgrade expects to burn a portion of the base fee paid to miners, thereby reducing the supply of Ether. Crypto education platform CoinMonk noted in March that the London hard fork upgrade could ideally burn 1 million ETH in 365 days, which is almost 1% of the network.Grayscale, a New York-based digital asset investment firm, also wrote in a report in February that deflationary dynamics would prove extremely bullish for Ether prices. ETH/USD surged by almost 180% to its record high of $4,385 after the report came out.The latest downturn in Ether markets has flashed serious concerns about the London hard fork’s ability to withhold bullish bias. For instance, analysts at TradingView said in their timeline updates that inflationary pressures from United States markets might have boosted ETH/USD’s downside sentiment.In detail, the U.S. Labor Department last week released June’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The latest data showed that inflation in the U.S. rose 0.9% in June to 5.4%, the fastest just before the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin and Ether prices dropped after the report was released.“Typically, cryptocurrency has been seen by digital asset investors as a hedge against inflation,” TradingView analysts wrote, adding:But not everyone is bearish. For instance, Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of CEX.IO exchange, anticipates Ether prices to reach $3,000 following the London hard fork.“As things stand, the Federal Reserve has increased the size of its balance sheet from early 2020 to more than $8 trillion — a substantial rise,” he said, adding that the reduced prices in the cryptocurrency markets are an opportunity for investors against beaten-down safe-havens in traditional markets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-20,"  A rout in sentiment in both crypto and traditional markets underscores the “extreme fear” surrounding Bitcoin’s move below $30,000. Bitcoin (BTC) failed to regain $30,000 after losing support on Tuesday as Fear & Greed indexes raced each other to the bottom. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD continued trading in the $20,000–$30,000 zone on Tuesday.The largest cryptocurrency saw a turbulent night’s price action, abruptly adding to existing losses to seal 24-hour negative returns of -6%.The move came in tandem with a souring sentiment on traditional markets. The Fear & Greed Index, which uses a basket of factors to determine the mood among market participants, fell into the “extreme fear” zone on Tuesday, measuring 17/100.At the same time, the cryptocurrency equivalent, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, raced to catch up, dropping to 19/100 — also denoted as “extreme fear.”Crypto Fear & Greed saw local lows of just 10/100 last month, while the traditional counterpart’s score has halved in a week.Perhaps predictably, traders were more than cautious.“Rejects $32.3K, Rejects $31K, and now at the next support zone,” Cointelegraph’s Michaël van de Poppe warned. On Monday, fellow trader and analyst Rekt Capital summed up the grim picture on spot markets, concluding that downside was more likely to prevail. In the event, BTC/USD fell almost exactly to his target zone.“BTC has lost Weekly support (black) and convincingly lost the blue 50-week EMA,” he summarized on Twitter alongside the relevant chart. A look at buy and sell positions on major exchange Binance, meanwhile, showed support remaining in place between $27,000 and $29,000 despite the price dip.Related: Institutional demand for Bitcoin evaporates as BTC struggles below $31KResistance, on the other hand, was thin below $35,000, providing a silver lining for bulls hoping for a swift rebound should the market find fuel for a U-turn back above the $30,000 mark.Altcoins compounded existing weakness as Bitcoin fell, with many of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization hitting 20% weekly losses.Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, lost a longer-term 2021 uptrend on Monday, continuing to trade below $1,800."
2021-07-20,"  Despite the Bitcoin markets slipping below $30,000, on-chain data suggests accumulation may be underway, as $1 billion worth of BTC leaves exchanges each month.  Despite Bitcoin (BTC) crashing below $30,000 for the first time in one month, on-chain metrics suggest whales may be steadily accumulating BTC.According to Glassnode’s Monday “The Week On-Chain” report, the Bitcoin reserves of centralized exchanges have continued to evaporate despite the recently sustained bearish momentum, with an average of 36,000 Bitcoin (worth roughly $1 billion) being withdrawn from exchanges monthly. Glassnode infers the shrinking Bitcoin reserves on exchanges as indicating large investors moving BTC into secure storage rather than leaving their coins on exchanges in preparation for selling.Glassnode also identified a recent increase in the number of entities hodling Bitcoin since May, which increased from roughly 250,000 to nearly 300,000 today. Glassnode describes “an entity” as a unique on-chain cluster of associated addresses.The on-chain analytics provider noted that the number of “sending entities” —  unique address clusters associated with selling — has fallen by roughly one-third from 150,000 to 100,000, while “receiving entities” — addresses linked to accumulation or holding — have increased by roughly 20% from 190,000 to 250,000 over the same period.Despite emphasizing signals suggesting accumulation, Glassnode noted heavily divided market sentiment, predicting extreme volatility may be imminent for the markets:Related: Traders are withdrawing 2,000 BTC from centralized exchanges dailyIt added that miners are now also in accumulation mode despite expenses incurred in the great migration in the wake of China’s mining crackdown. The miner net position change metric indicates that more than 3,300 BTC per month is currently being accumulated."
2021-07-20,"  Ethereum, Uniswap, Binance Smart Chain and Aave are all beating out Bitcoin by daily fee revenue. Ethereum appears to be extending its fee dominance over Bitcoin by roughly 10 times, with Bitcoin currently ranking just sixth by weekly fee generation.According to CryptoFees’ data for Sunday, the Bitcoin network had generated $725.7 million in daily fees on average over the past seven days and less than $400,000 worth of fees for the day.Ethereum tops the rankings by far, generating more than $6.1 million in daily fees on average for the week and more than $5 million for the day. As such, Ethereum’s daily fees beat out Bitcoin’s by 8.4 times for the past week and by more than 15 times for Sunda.Uniswap v3 ranked second with an average of $1.5 million in daily fees, followed by Binance Smart Chain with $1.2 million, Uniswap v2 with $732,000, Aave with $728,000, and then Bitcoin.Twitter user Odin Free tweeted the findings, likening Ethereum’s network strength relative to Bitcoin to Facebook’s rise to dominance over Myspace during the late 2000s.

Davis noted the increasing popularity of layer-two scaling solutions for Ethereum is likely to increase the disparity.“I highly suspect this gap will increase now that we have layer twos like Optimism coming online,” he said.Ethereum is also beating out Bitcoin by total transaction count by roughly 500% and has enjoyed brief stints leading BItcoin by transaction volume, trading volume and node count over recent months."
2021-07-20,"  A lack of institutional demand and several bearish factors are complicating all efforts to pull Bitcoin’s price back above the $31,000 level. The rocky road that Bitcoin (BTC) has been on for the past two months continues as a widely predicted move downward materialized in the early hours on Monday and dropped the price of BTC below $31,000. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that a wave of mid-day selling pushed the price of BTC to a low of $30,400 before bulls arrived to provide support and lift the price back to $30,850. The market as a whole continues to face an uphill battle as the miner exodus following China’s crackdown on the mining industry has led to the fourth consecutive negative adjustment in the Bitcoin mining difficulty, a figure that has fallen by almost half since mid-May. Insights into the current state of the Bitcoin network were provided in the newest report from Glassnode, which set the stage by looking at the UTXO Realized Price Distribution, a metric that identifies on-chain volume profiles across different price groupings.Current data shows that 10.5% of the circulating supply of BTC has transacted in the range between $31,000 and $34,300, the highest level seen since a price of $11,000. While this indicates a healthy level of volume at the current level, it’s important to note that should BTC’s price break lower, the next significant support levels are at $26,500, $23,300 and $18,800.The market-wide pullback in May has led to a significant decline in interest from institutional investors, who now appear to be in risk-management mode as BTC’s price struggles to climb higher. Evidence of the decline in interest can be found by looking at the market price of GBTC, which continues to trade at an -11.0% to -15.3% discount, or by observing the net inflows to the Purpose ETF, which has slowed down significantly. Data from Glassnode shows that the exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw a net outflow of -90.76 BTC, which is its largest outflow since mid-May. Although institutional activity has been muted, on-chain deposits of BTC to exchanges continue with more than 28,700 BTC, the largest inflow in over a month and a half, taking place on Friday. Inflows during times of consolidation and corrections are often seen as negative developments, as they can result in increased selling, which can lead to a short-term price breakdown. Glassnode also pointed to the net inflow of 1,780 BTC to over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks in the past two weeks as “moving against the structural trend of outflows in place since November 2020.”Glassnode said:Related: Institutions cautious as crypto products post weakest volume since OctoberThe cryptocurrency market wasn’t the only market that faced downward pressure on Monday as a surge in COVID-19 cases led to a pullback in global financial markets. The S&P 500, DOW and Nasdaq all closed the day down 1.59%, 2.09% and 1.06%, respectively. Out of the top 200 cryptocurrencies, the only two notable performances of the day were a 24% gain for Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST) and a 17% rally from Dash. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.245 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 46.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-19,"  It’s doom and gloom for Bitcoin a day after the feared Grayscale unlocking event, with altcoins performing even worse. Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $31,000 support on Monday after sideways trading gave way to downside pressure. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting local lows of $30,630 on Bitstamp on Monday.Coming a day after Bitcoin's lowest weekly close since December 2020, the price action underscored the sensitivity of a market with low volume and network fundamentals still in their recovery phase.Traders had broadly predicted a move downward after Bitcoin had failed to hold on to support levels higher up, with the integrity of $30,000 itself being called into question.“Volatility, finally for Bitcoin,” in-house trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $30,700 with daily losses at around 3%. A glance at buy and sell orders on major exchange Binance showed considerable demand remaining at $27,000 and upward, reducing the likelihood of a deeper dive beyond that area.Among market participants, it was all about catching the likely price bottom.Not saying this is the bottom.I'm just saying the PA always looks horrible at the bottom, and that the bottom is only too obvious when it's too late to catch it.3k & 30k- Similar sentiment, most calling for 28k n lower.- Similar structure, fakeout and slow bleed.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/9NyEC6o6HDEarlier, van de Poppe had also suggested that the ultimate BTC price floor may not come as a result of a sudden dive or have clearly defined characteristics.A daily close below $31,000, nonetheless, has not happened since January.Bitcoin’s dive, meanwhile, sparked instant pain for altcoins, which often doubled the largest cryptocurrency’s hourly losses.Related: Bitcoin sees second-longest bull market drawdown with BTC price 'stuck' at $30KEther (ETH) shed nearly 8% on the day to hit $1,800 support, highlighting a fragile altcoin environment still at the mercy of Bitcoin sentiment. A possible overall explanation lay at the door of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which on Sunday completed a 16,000-BTC unlocking event, which only a day later could have an opportunity to impact the market.Today, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told CNBC in an interview that the regulatory discussion on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is entering its ‘’final stages’’ and that the company is committed to turning GBTC into such a product."
2021-07-19,"  Bitcoin mining difficulty has posted another negative adjustment on Sunday, with the difficulty rate almost halving since mid-May. Amid the ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in China, mining new Bitcoin (BTC) continues getting easier as BTC has experienced another mining difficulty drop.On July 18, the Bitcoin network posted its fourth consecutive negative adjustment of mining difficulty, dropping 4.8%, according to data from Bitcoin explorer BTC.com.The latest mining difficulty adjustment occurred at block 691,488, reducing the difficulty rate from 14.4 trillion to 13.7 trillion, the lowest level recorded since June 2020. The difficulty metrics have now almost halved over the past two months, after reaching over 25 trillion on May 13.The latest Bitcoin mining adjustment follows a series of consecutive difficulty drops that started with a nearly 16% decline on May 29. Further negative adjustments continued with a 5.3% drop on June 13 and a massive 28% decline on July 3 — the biggest mining difficulty drop on the Bitcoin network.Related: Bitcoin miner revenue jumps by 50% in 4 days since record difficulty dropBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to mine a BTC block, with a higher difficulty requiring additional computing power to verify transactions and mine new coins. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, or about every two weeks, as Bitcoin is programmed to self-adjust in order to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes.Bitcoin’s continuing mining difficulty decline comes in response to the ongoing miner migration out of China caused by a major crackdown on the cryptocurrency mining by local authorities. The ongoing difficulty drop falls in parallel with declining Bitcoin hashrate as well as decreasing average BTC transaction fees."
2021-07-17,"  Bitcoin price struggles to gain momentum as historically low spot volumes and a strengthening dollar result in widespread indecision from most traders. If one word could be used to describe how the majority of participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem feel about the near-term outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) it would be 'undecided', as mixed signals from all manner of indicators have many traders waiting for a significant move in either direction before planning their next entry point. A new report from Delphi Digital took a macro look at Bitcoin's current price action and found that a variety of factors, including low exchange volumes and the strengthening U.S. dollar have weighed heavily on the top cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin's recent dip to $31,000 adds to the aura of fear that currently envelops the crypto market and analysts are now warning that failure to close above $31,000 could see BTC drop to the $29,000 to $24,000 zone.Here are three areas of focus that Delphi Digital highlights as being the most impactful on the short-term price action for BitcoinAccording to Delphi Digital, declines in trading activity are one of the biggest factors affecting the market. This is because after the May 19 sell-off there was an exodus of spot and derivatives traders from exchanges. As seen in the chart above, after seeing a substantial increase during the first half of 2021, exchange volumes have fallen by more than 60% as prices collapsed and traders swore off using leverage. The precipitous drop in BTC price also helped to tamper down retail traders' use of high leverage in derivatives markets and proof of this comes from BTC futures open interest dropping back to levels seen since early 2021. Delphi Digital said:On a more positive note, the mega liquidation event seen back in May helped clear out overleveraged traders, meaning “stronger-handed participants are the ones primarily contributing to current open interest levels.” Another factor weighing on the price of Bitcoin has been the recent strength of the U.S. dollar, which has been on an uptrend since bottoming at 89.53 on May 25.As seen in the chart above, a large inverse head and shoulders pattern has formed on the DXY chart with the neckline now being tested for the third time. Should the dollar make another leg higher, the current economic recovery could be threatened as financial conditions would tighten and this might weigh heavily on many of the most popular trades of 2021. Delphi Digital said:While the 51% drop in BTC price has many analysts afraid that another multi-year bear market could be starting, it’s important to account for some of the larger macro trends that led to the current conditions. The above chart shows that Bitcoin had six consecutive months of price gains before a downturn and the asset was due for a pullback from a historical perspective. Even with BTC down 51% from its all-time high, on a year-over-year basis, its price is still 250% higher than its $9,100 valuation on July 16, 2020. The long-term uptrend for Bitcoin remains intact with its price currently testing the 12-month moving average, an important level of support that will determine where the price heads from here. Bitcoin trading volume on spot and derivative exchanges is down and the prospects of a strengthening dollar weigh heavily on global financial markets. This has resulted in indecisiveness being the primary emotion that rules the crypto market at the moment and this sentiment is likely to persist until a major price movement or motivating event prompts engagement from sidelined traders.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-17,"  The latest meltdown in BitFinex BTC shorts could follow up with a spike in spot Bitcoin bids, stated one analyst. Bitcoin (BTC) bears should watch out for a potential blow as the number of margined short positions on the Bitfinex exchange crashes by roughly 25%.The dataset dropped to 11,066 BTC as of 12:20 GMT Saturday, compared to 14,897 BTC at the session's open. Meanwhile, the drop came as a part of a bigger downside move that started on July 15. On the day, the total number of margined short positions had reached 17,053 BTC.In simple terms, BTCUSDSHORTS represents the number of margined bearish positions on Bitfinex, measured in BTC. Traders borrow funds from Bitfinex — their broker — to bet on bearish outcomes for the instrument BTC/USD. That said, the latest data shows that traders have reduced their leveraged bearish exposure in the Bitcoin market.Popular trader Scott Melker claimed that each massive drop in the BTCUSDSHORTS positions on Bitfinex leads to a run-up in the spot Bitcoin prices, adding that he will be watching markest for a similar bullish reaction.Bitfinex whale may be starting to wind down those shorts. Each time they drop, price has risen. Will be watching. pic.twitter.com/5F40LYjMVLThrowing a closer look at the BTCUSD-BTCUSDSHORTS correlation showed an erratic positive correlation. The Bitfinex short positions went for a Bear Run after December 2020, a period that coincided with a spike across Bitcoin spot and derivatives markets. In April-May, a run-down in Bitfinex short positions coincided with the Bitcoin price surging from sub-$45,000 to a record high of $65,000. Nonetheless, similar BTCUSDSHORTS crashes in June—at best—kept Bitcoin stabilized above a psychological support level of $30,000, if not pumped it outright.Downside pressure on Bitcoin sustains despite a recent drop in BTCUSDShorts also as Grayscale Investments unlock 16,000 BTC worth of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares on July 18, after a six-month lock-up period.JPMorgan & Chase strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou warned in June that Grayscale's massive unlocking event could become the source of the next selling wave in the Bitcoin market. On-chain analyst Willy Woo echoed similar concerns last week, explaining that when GBTC premium drops relative to the Bitcoin units held in Grayscale's reserves, it tends to divert investors from spot markets.""Investors now have more incentive to by GBTC shares rather than BTC, it diverts some of the buying pressure on BTC spot markets,"" said Woo. ""This is bearish.""(1) is sudden and directly impactful than while (2) acts very slowly. Thus it's a bullish.The over all impact over the long term is neutral as it's all arbitrage which balances out in time. What we are analysing is the short term demand/supply imbalances which may impact price.As an optimistic BTCUSDSHORTS drop offsets a pessimistic GBTC unlock event, the spot BTC/USD exchange rate holds $31,000 as its interim support.BTC/USD has repeatedly tested the $30,000-$31,000 range as support before rebounding higher. A maximum of its retracement has been able to pierce through the $35,000-resistance level. Nonetheless, profit-taking sentiment pushed the pair back toward $30,000.As a result, the bearish sentiment for Bitcoin among analysts is extremely high, below $30,000.

2021-07-17,"  Is a bullish reversal incoming, or is crypto starting a bear market? It’s not clear where the markets will go, so let’s weigh the facts.  It has now been three months since Bitcoin’s price peaked at an all-time high just shy of $65,000. For most of the last two months, Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in the $30,000–$40,000 range, as much as 54% lower than its peakThe downturn came at a time when many analysts were predicting exactly the opposite — a bull cycle set to run to new record highs within months — with some even speculating that a six-figure BTC price would materialize this year. So, what’s going on? Is the current market downturn just a blip on an otherwise upward trajectory, or is the crypto market back in the kind of long-term bearish territory last seen in 2018?Bitcoin’s historical price activity has a compelling correlation with its halving cycles, with previous all-time highs being reached within around 12 to 18 months of a halving. PlanB, the creator of the Stock-to-Flow BTC price model, is among the most vocal proponents of this. On Twitter, the analyst remains resolute that the Stock-to-Flow Cross Asset Model (S2FX) predicts further bullish action, pointing to similar temporary downturns before epic rallies in previous cycles.So far, the S2FX model has been one of the most accurate price predictors of Bitcoin over the years. In addition, on-chain metrics appear to support the theory that bearish sentiments could be short-lived. For instance, shortly after Bitcoin’s April price peak, traders suddenly started moving funds onto exchanges, ending an almost uninterrupted eight-month run of HODLing. Igneus Terrenus, head of communications at crypto exchange Bybit, believes that short-term traders were responsible for the sell-off following BTC’s price highs. He told Cointelegraph:“A series of deleveraging events shook off many short-term speculators, whose capitulation accounts for the majority of realized losses in recent months. While the euphoria at the start of the year has all but dissipated, whales and long-term holders have remained confident through the market's overall bearish sentiments.”However, over the recent weeks, trading platforms have once again seen funds flowing out. Glassnode’s Realized HODL Ratio, which tracks the willingness of investors to let go of their holdings, also appears to reflect similar patterns seen in previous cycles. Richard Nie, chief research analyst at Bingbon, believes that the exchange flows are telling. Speaking to Cointelegraph, he concurred that the metrics indicate a bullish shift. “We ought to pay attention to the number of whale holders and the amount of BTC held by exchanges,” he said, adding that as “more BTC is withdrawn from exchanges and moved into private addresses, this is a strong bullish signal.”Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph: “Right now crypto volumes across exchanges are the lowest they’ve been all year. Once trading picks up again, that would be a good indication the lull is complete.”Project funding is another significant indicator of market sentiment, and 2021 has been an outstanding year for crypto startups. As reported by Cointelegraph, the crypto industry saw more funding in the first quarter of 2021 than in all of 2020 put together, pulling in $2.6 billion.The downturn since April doesn’t appear to have spoiled the appetites of venture capitalists at all. In late May, stablecoin issuer Circle raised $440 million, and only days later, Mike Novogratz’s Cryptology Asset Group announced it was launching a crypto investment fund worth $100 million. By mid-June, Bloomberg had reported that the total venture capital investment in crypto for the year was already up to over $17 billion. Even discounting the $10 billion that Block.one directed into its new exchange venture, it’s sufficient to demonstrate that the crypto market’s second-quarter performance hasn’t yet affected the growth in venture capital investment.There are also macro market factors to consider. Amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding the state of the global economy, some, including Robert Kiyosaki — author of Rich Dad Poor Dad — have predicted a stock market crash. In Kiyosaki’s case, he’s also been encouraging his followers to stock up on gold and Bitcoin. There are signs that Bitcoin may be becoming more correlated to stocks, but could a mass stock sell-off mean investors ultimately turn to BTC as a safe-haven asset?A further consideration is Bitcoin's upcoming Taproot upgrade due to activate in November. It marks the first upgrade to the Bitcoin network since the Segregated Witness (SegWit) fork, which took place in August 2017. Of course, that was followed by an epic run up to a new all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017. It’s hard to know if history could repeat itself in this regard or if there’s even any direct correlation between the upgrades and the markets, but it’s worth bearing in mind.It’s beyond doubt that the biggest bearish forces shaping the markets over the last few months have been regulatory. Most notably, the Chinese government’s mining clampdown has created widespread uncertainty. Many large mining operations have been forced offline — in some cases permanently and in others temporarily as they relocated from China to new sites. This migration no doubt came at a significant expense, and in the meantime, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has undergone its biggest drop in history, only confirming the impact that the clampdown has had on the network.However, lawmakers from other countries have also recently started to take a closer look at crypto. India, which only relaxed its stance toward cryptocurrencies in 2020, could once again be considering a ban, although the situation continues to evolve. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority also recently launched a campaign against Binance, ordering it to stop undertaking regulated activity in the country. Now, crypto firms are withdrawing licensing applications in the U.K., while users are finding themselves locked out of the exchange by their banks. In general, Binance has been under regulatory pressure from all over the world, for a variety of reasons. In the meantime, it’s still not clear if regulators are going after Binance specifically or if the exchange is simply seen as a representative of the rest of the crypto industry.Related: Binance in the crosshairs: Are regulators paying attention to crypto?Institutional analysts have also been making ominous predictions about Bitcoin’s price, with JPMorgan issuing a warning that the near-term setup for BTC continues to look unstable. While these developments aren’t likely to be as seismic as the Chinese mining ban, they haven’t helped market confidence. Daniele Bernardi, CEO of fintech management company Diaman Group, believes that there are reasons to be cautious, telling Cointelegraph:“If we analyze the Bitcoin price based on the S2F model, Bitcoin prices have the potential to triple in the short term. However, at Diaman, we’ve also developed a model based on the rate of adoption. Following this model, a $64k ATH is fair.”As it has previously been suggested that most of the signals point to this bull market only being at a halfway point, is there enough evidence to reverse that direction? All things considered — and unsurprisingly — it’s too soon to say definitively. On one side, there is regulatory tumult and a substantial decrease in trading volume, suggesting an overall lack of interest and engagement. On the other, there are some telling on-chain metrics and indicators of investor sentiment that appear to stack up in favor of a continuing bull market.Related: GBTC unlock edges closer as impact on Bitcoin price remains unclearHowever, in practice, the regulatory issues continue to spook the market, proving that price models and VC funding aren’t necessarily able to assuage concerns. If there are further major clampdowns, then it may be that the bull market cannot recover after all.The fact that prices have held above $30,000 thus far, despite perhaps the biggest test to mining security in history, is a testament to the bullish forces at play. If the current regulatory situation starts to calm, then there’s every chance that the bullish part of the market cycle could still play out to its predicted conclusion."
2021-07-16,"  A strengthening dollar could be negative for pretty much every risk asset on board, including Bitcoin, whose value boomed against the dwindling greenback after March 2020. Dollar traders have kept a close eye on a potentially bullish ""inverse head-and-shoulders"" pattern building in the U.S. dollar index (DXY) chart. Meanwhile, the smell of a stronger greenback is weakening Bitcoin's (BTC) upside case, especially as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to break out of its current $30,000-35,000 trading range.In detail, the inverse head-and-shoulders (IH&S) pattern  forms after a downtrend. It contains three successive troughs, with the middle trough (head) being the deepest than the other two (shoulders). Ideally, the two shoulders are of equal height and width. All three troughs hang by a price ceiling known as a neckline that serves as resistance.DXY, which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, currently checks all the boxes to prove that it has formed an IH&S pattern. The index now stares at the prospect of undergoing a bullish breakout upon closing above its neckline resistance. In doing so, it would set up a technical profit target at a distance equal to the price gap between the neckline to the bottom of the head.The bullish setup expects DXY to rise by almost 5% on a potential neckline breakout move. Meanwhile, the index's 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the blue wave) also anticipates to cross above its 200-day simple moving average (20-day SMA; the saffron wave) to confirm a Golden Cross. Traders consider golden crosses as bullish indicators.A weaker dollar environment after March 2020 served as a tailwind for risk assets and global growth, propelled by the U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policies to cushion the economic aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. DXY closed 2020 at a 6.83% loss.But entering 2021, the dollar showed signs of trend reversals as the U.S. economy rebounded strongly amid a speedy coronavirus vaccination program. As markets reopened, demand for the dollar and dollar-based investments rose among global investors. Brent Johnson, chief executive of Santiago Capital, called the dollar ""Giffen Good,"" a type of asset whose demand increases with its prices. He noted that despite rising inflation caused by Fed's money printing, global investors had increased their dollar debts, adding:Kevin Kelly, the chief financial analyst at Delphi Digital, said that net speculative futures positioning on DXY is not as bearish it was at the beginning of 2021. He added that the setup is very similar to DXY's positioning in early 2018 that followed by a roughly 10% price rally in the next 18 months.A recent run-up in the DXY market came alongside three back-to-back monthly spikes in inflation. Per the latest Labor Department released this Tuesday, the U.S. consumer price index rose to 5.4% year-over-year, the highest 12-month rate since August 2008. James Freeman, the assistant editor at the Wall Street Journal, blamed the Fed's money printing policies for the ongoing inflationary pressure, noting that the dollars in each wallet have been actively losing their value as a result. Nonetheless, the Fed has assured that inflation was a temporary problem, providing a bullish backstop to the DXY rally.In his congressional testimony on Wednesday, Fed chairman Jerome Powell admitted that the economic conditions at present do not allow them to taper bank their quantitative easing programs, including a $120bn a month bond-buying program. However, Powell added that the Fed would alert markets in advance if they ever decided to scale back its purchasing.Combined with lower rates, the Fed's expansionary policies have spurred cheaper lending, thus creating more demand for assets, including homes, tech stocks, gold, and even Bitcoin. But, at the same time, fears that a consistently rising inflation would prompt the central bank to cut rates have also pressured seemingly overvalued assets to lose a portion of their yearlong gains.For example, Bitcoin, often propagated as a hedge against higher inflation, dropped by more than 50% from its record high of about $65,000. Its plunge largely appeared in the wake of regulatory crackdowns around the world, a Chinese mining exodus, among other factors. But the Federal Open Market Committee's decision mid-June to cut interest rates in 2023 may have also added to its downside momentum.""If the US dollar reverses trend, it threatens to throw cold water on some of this year’s most popular trades,"" noted Kelly. Nevertheless, some analysts see a rising dollar as no threat to Bitcoin, believing that investors would keep allocating a portion of their portfolio to the emerging global asset. ARK Invest Founder and CEO Cathie Wood, for example, told CNBC Bitcoin could end up on a more solid footing after overcoming worries related to the recent China crypto mining ban and its alarming carbon footprints, an issue raised by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in May.An Intertrust survey of hedge fund chief financial officers worldwide also found that they would increase their crypto exposure significantly by 2026. 17% of respondents expected to allocate more than 10% in Bitcoin and similar digital assets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-15,"  A failure to retain $31,000 would mean that $29,000 and then $24,000 are on the menu, says Michaël van de Poppe. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its ""final support zone"" above $31,000 on July 15 as a low grind downward brought fresh predictions of a BTC price crash.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting fresh local lows of $31,550 on Thursday.The pair had made little progress overnight, falling further as Italian lawmakers said that major exchange Binance was unauthorized to trade in their jurisdiction.The latest in a series of setbacks for the exchange, a spokesperson nonetheless told the mainstream media that its operations were unaffected by the announcement.""We take a collaborative approach in working with regulators and we take our compliance obligations very seriously,"" the spokesperson commented, quoted by Reuters.As such, there remained little cause for optimism among spot traders. For popular trader Michaël van de Poppe, $31,000 represented Bitcoin's last hope of avoiding a more series dip.""Bitcoin didn't hold the $32.4K level as support and dipped lower, through which it's facing the final support zone to hold (the $31-31.5K region),"" he summarized earlier on the day. The price headache is being exacerbated by a conspicuous lack of interest among investors, with low volumes meaning a sustained bullish uptick is unlikely.Related: ‘It’s fine’ to buy Bitcoin as gold substitute, says Trump ex-Treasury Secretary MnuchinAs data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode revealed, however, it may be a seasonal, rather than an emotional phenomenon.""Investors aren't selling, they are simply on holiday,"" co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel argued, pointing to a significant reduction in exchange transaction fees.As Cointelegraph reported, further data shows that accumulation is underway even by investors who sold when BTC/USD hit $30,000 on the way to current all-time highs."
2021-07-15,"  The Chinese government’s ongoing crusade against cryptocurrencies might have dramatic consequences for both domestic and global crypto traders.  Since the start of the summer, a series of measures from Chinese authorities to curb cryptocurrency trading and mining have dominated the crypto news cycle. From urging financial service providers to throttle cryptocurrency-related transactions to ordering a crypto trading software provider shut down, the initiatives coming out of Beijing and their repercussions are widely believed to have contributed considerably to the recent market downturn.What motivates this new round of hostile actions, and how will they affect the cryptocurrency space of the nation that had once accounted for some two-thirds of the global digital asset supply? Furthermore, it seems that whatever happens in China is having a great effect on other parts of the world, which doesn’t seem to be negative.It is not hard to notice how the intensifying clampdown on trading and mining of decentralized cryptocurrencies comes hand-in-hand with the ramping up of China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. As part of the Digital Currency Electronic Payment system testing, stacks of the government-issued electronic money have already landed in the wallet apps of some 200,000 Chinese citizens selected via a lottery. It looks as if larger-scale trials and wide implementation can be expected within months.When it comes to the distribution of political or economic power, Chinese leadership is not in the habit of promoting pluralism and competition. Up to a certain point, the nation’s sprawling cryptocurrency sector could eschew scrutiny, as it didn’t come into direct conflict with the government’s strategic plans, but this does not seem to be the case anymore.Yu Xiong, professor of business analytics and director of the Center for Innovation and Commercialization at the University of Surrey, told Cointelegraph that China will not allow any currency to affect the renminbi, and for that reason, it can’t allow Bitcoin (BTC) to grow too big. Xiong added:With major Chinese banks such as the Agricultural Bank of China falling in line and squishing consumer and business operations related to crypto, the concerted effort looks more like a chokehold than a lack of encouragement. On the receiving end of the government’s anti-Bitcoin push, crypto businesses and everyday users are dealing with the dire consequences of the stiffening policies.The authorities’ all-around crusade against China’s cryptocurrency sector encompasses all major groups of stakeholders: As financial service providers are waking up to their bank accounts suspended, miners in several key provinces are receiving eviction notices. The exit of the company that operated the nation’s oldest Bitcoin exchange vividly illustrates the depth of the crisis.Yifan He, CEO of Hong Kong-based blockchain firm Red Date Technology, opined to Cointelegraph that “the entire crypto industry in China is officially gone.” He thinks that while trading has always been in the area and mining was largely supported by some local governments, the current prohibitive turn in governmental policy will deal both types of activity a blow, from which they are unlikely to recover anytime soon:In He’s opinion, a fraction of crypto trading can still persist, yet it will have to migrate underground. This will essentially put an end to China’s BTC mining dominance, as miners will either have to shut down completely or relocate and be regulated in other jurisdictions. What’s being witnessed right now appears to be nothing short of the dismantling of the entire cryptocurrency industry in the country that, until recently, was a major mining and trading powerhouse. Most everyday Chinese traders will likely find the new rules prohibitive and cease trading activity. Mining businesses will face a choice between vanishing and opening up shop in a different jurisdiction. Those who appreciated the ease of transacting in digital assets will soon have a centralized alternative in the government-backed CBDC.Squashing the crypto sector on such a vast scale is inevitably echoing on the global scale as well. With much of the Chinese mining capacity gone, the hash power map of the world will have to undergo a dramatic rearrangement, with new centers of mining power emerging elsewhere to fill the void. With that, not just the firms but also the regular users will be affected in the long run, as some parts of the world will start witnessing an inflow of crypto-related business, to which regulators will start responding.It is also possible that the loss of Chinese trading activity will become a factor weighing on the global crypto market for quite some time. Building and sustaining a new bull run comparable to that of the early 2021 — a process that requires a continuous inflow of new market participants — might become more challenging, given that China is no longer able to supply the user base growth it had contributed previously. The rest of the world is going to have to try really hard to compensate for China’s departure."
2021-07-14,"  Bitcoin and Ethereum were the center of attention in Q1 but data shows DOGE, ETC and MATIC were the top performers of Q2. In early 2021 Bitcoin and Ether price was the center of attention as each asset seemed to hit a new all-time high every 24-hours and traders called for $100,000 BTC and $5,000 ETH. Fast forward to the present and both assets are still more than 40% down from their all-time highs and the bulls calling for unbelievable price targets are nowhere to be found.    A recent report from CoinMetrics reviewed the performance of Bitcoin and altcoins during Q2 2021 and the analysts found that even with the sharp May 19 market correction many assets finished the quarter in the green with Dogecoin (DOGE) coming out on top with a  392% gain.Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Polygon (MATIC) were the other two breakaway stars of Q2, with each gaining 297% and 227% respectively despite a nearly 39% decline in the price of Bitcoin. One of the biggest developments during Q2 was the Ether price breakout from $1,971 on April 1 to a new record high of $4,362 on May 11 before the market-wide sell-off resulted in a quarterly close at $2,240, which represents a 13.2% gain.CoinMetrics highlighted that Ether price “benefited from a renewed surge of retail interest which was partially driven by the rapid rise of NFTs.”As a result of the retail surge, the number of addresses holding at least 0.1 Ether increased from 4.58 million to more than 5.20 million.Ether’s positive finish, when compared to the significant decline in Bitcoin, is also indicative of the increased attention the top-ranked altcoin is receiving from institutional investors looking to diversify away from BTC. As mentioned earlier, the best performance in Q2 came from DOGE, which managed to finish the quarter up 392% despite a 66% decline from its $0.74 all-time high set back on May 8. According to the report, the number of addresses holding at least 1 DOGE increased from 3.09 million on April 1 to 3.7 million addresses on June 30. DOGE addresses continued to increase in the month of June while new Ether addresses essentially flatlined at the end of May. As a result of the gains made by altcoins, Bitcoin dominance fell to 45% on June 30, its lowest level since July 2018. CoinMetrics pointed out that the significant headwinds BTC faced were partially a result of China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, which resulted in a 50% decline in hash rate in Q2 to its lowest level since late 2019. Related: Bitcoin mining ban an easy decision for China, says Bitmain EMEA partnerThis decline is likely temporary and the hash rate “should eventually recover once miners start to power back up in their new locations,” but CoinMetrics warned that this “won’t happen overnight since it will take time to build and set up enough facilities to accommodate the sudden influx of new demand.” Overall, CoinMetrics and other analysts see the development as a long-term positive development for the Bitcoin ecosystem headed forward.

2021-07-14,"  Long-awaited layer two scaling is finally being launched on Uniswap v3, albeit in a limited format initially. The long-awaited layer two scaling solutions upgrade for Uniswap has finally been spotted in the wild with the launch of version 3 on Optimistic Ethereum.In a post on July 13, the world’s most popular decentralized exchange stated that it was pleased to finally announce the alpha launch of Uniswap v3 on the Optimistic Ethereum (OΞ) mainnet.The alpha launch is a limited version of the full system which helps developers deploy the system gradually and address any issues that may arise. The blog post elaborated:The DEX warned of potential downtime, and stated that withdrawals from OΞ to layer one will take seven days. It also stated that there are limited assets at launch, namely ETH, USDT, WBTC, DAI, and SNX, but more  will be added in the coming days and weeks.During the alpha period, the platform will support an initial throughput of 0.6 transactions per second. It added that this should equate to a transaction capacity roughly in line with layer one, but transactions on OΞ confirm instantly meaning there are no more pending or stuck swaps.Uniswap explained that assuming v3 has equal usage to layer one, OΞ should offer transaction cost savings of up to ten times, however increased demand will drive gas costs higher. The transaction speeds will be increased over the coming weeks and months as the infrastructure is tested and optimized at scale.Protocol founder Hayden Adams commented on the launch and high-speed transaction capabilities, adding:1/ It's happening Instant transactions and a steady increase in scaling w/ the end goal of fully meeting demand for low cost, high speed DEX trading All built on Ethereum and preserving decentralization https://t.co/SyVtUsswYWRelated: Will the launch of Uniswap v3 spark a new DeFi boom?Initial users have been impressed, with Bankless founder David Hoffman exclaiming “It's instantaneous and insanely cheap. 5 swaps in 30 seconds, and I wasn't even trying to be fast.”Uniswap said that the scaling solution is complementary to Ethereum 2.0:OΞ uses an optimistic rollup which changes the zero-knowledge consensus principle by assuming that all transaction verifications are correct. Users only intervene only if they see an incorrect transaction whereby they can submit a “fraud-proof” to signal that the data is incorrect.DeFi platform Synthetix has also announced the launch of Optimistic Ethereum for its layer two exchange for the week beginning July 26. In late May, the Ethereum layer two scaling solutions provider announced a collaboration with blockchain analytics platform Etherscan."
2021-07-14,"  The inverted pattern in the Bitcoin futures curve is a signal that investors’ confidence in BTC price continues to slump. It's not yet known whether Binance's recent news of  being temporarily suspended from the U.K.’s financial system is the main driver behind today's Bitcoin (BTC) price drop. As Cointelegraph reported, the exchange sent emails to affected customers but has not given any details.Regardless of the reason behind the price weakness, derivatives contracts started to display some oddities, and this could be a troubling sign.Bitcoin quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. Although it might seem complicated for retail traders due to their settlement date and price difference from spot markets, their most significant advantage is the lack of a fluctuating funding rate.When traders opt for perpetual contracts (inverse swaps), there is a fee usually charged every 8-hours that will change depending on which side demands more leverage. On the other hand, fixed-date expiry contracts typically trade at a premium from regular spot market exchanges.This effect occurs as sellers are postponing settlement, therefore requesting compensation for this time.As depicted above, the Sept. 24 contract is trading with a 2.2% annualized premium at Deribit, while the Dec. 31 contract is at 3.8%. This curve is precisely what one should expect in healthy markets because a longer settlement period would usually cause sellers to request a more substantial premium.Keep in mind that there's a decent 'Cash and Carry' activity being deployed by arbitrage desks, buying Bitcoin while simultaneously shorting (selling) the futures contract. These players aren't effectively betting on a negative price swing as their net exposure is flat, but this activity limits the premium on futures contracts.Related: Bitcoin price is down, but here’s 3 reasons why $1B liquidations are less frequentTherefore, a couple of exchanges presenting a flat or slightly inverted futures' curve should not be interpreted as a bearish indicator. More importantly, investors should measure the 3-month futures premium, which should stay above 4% annualized. Whenever this metric falls below that, it indicates a lack of interest in leverage longs and is interpreted as bearish.Currently, the average September annualized basis (premium) of the four exchanges examined is running at 3.3%, which is definitively worrisome. However, this is not unusual after the market experienced a 50% correction. This situation should simply be interpreted as a lack of confidence from buyers instead of an alarming bearish sign.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-13,"  Traders appear to be sitting on their hands even as Bitcoin price drops closer to a critical support level at $32,000. Within the past few hours, a fresh wave of selling pushed Bitcoin (BTC) price close to the $32,000 support level as the low trading volume and general disinterest from traders saw the price revisit the lower section of its current range.The price of Ether (ETH) also fell under pressure alongside Bitcoin as the building momentum ahead of the network’s upcoming London Hard Fork failed to support a price above $2,000, resulting in a daily low of $1,918.

2021-07-13,"  The second-largest cryptocurrency sells off in line with Bitcoin as traders assess the latest U.S. inflation data. Ether (ETH) perhaps had the most bullish outlook entering the July session, with the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 promising to make ETH scarcer through the network’s first-ever burning mechanism.But so far into the month, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has vastly tailed its top rival Bitcoin (BTC). The positive correlation was visible on Tuesday, following the New York opening bell when Ether plunged below $2,000 to hit a two-week low in sync with Bitcoin, which slipped below $32,500.As it happened, the ETH/USD exchange rate reached its intraday low of $1,961.10 following a 3.43% drop. The pair’s modestly bearish move locked step with Bitcoin, which apprehensively fell as traders assessed the latest United States inflation data.The U.S. Consumer Price Index ticked up 0.9% in June to hit 5.4% year-over-year, marking its highest level since 1991. Traders sold off Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the news, pointing to fears that a continuously rising inflation rate would prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to withdraw its quantitative easing policies.In detail, the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting revealed officials in favor of at least two rate hikes by the end of 2023, providing the inflation rate runs too hot above their 2% target. The central bank has been maintaining interest rates below 0.25% since March 2020, which sapped investors’ dollar demand and, in turn, had boosted demand for so-called safe-haven assets, including Bitcoin.Ether, whose one-year correlation coefficient with Bitcoin stands at 0.64, according to Crypto Watch, surged all across 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021 on similar macroeconomic fundamentals.The cryptocurrency, however, logged better gains than Bitcoin, owing to its role in a flurry of booming crypto sectors, including decentralized finance, nonfungible tokens and stablecoins.But the Ethereum network also suffered from technical setbacks in the form of a jammed bandwidth. An overloaded blockchain prompted miners — entities that process and add transactions to Ethereum’s public ledger — to raise their fees. In some cases, users were forced to pay more gas fees than the amount they were transferring.The problems appear to have come to a final resolution, as Ethereum intends to switch its protocol from a miner-friendly but energy-intensive proof-of-work to a faster and cheaper proof-of-stake (PoS). In detail, the so-called London hard fork, which includes five improvement proposals, expects to counter those inefficiencies.One of the improvement protocols, called EIP-1559, introduces a new fee structure to make Ether less inflationary. It proposes to burn a portion of the fee collected in ETH, thus adding deflationary pressure on the cryptocurrency. In addition, the upgrade replaces miners with validators. In doing so, Ethereum requires each validator to lock at least 32 ETH to run its PoS network.That also put a good portion of ETH supply out of circulation, making it as scarce as Bitcoin. For Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at CEX.IO, rising macro inflation provides more bullish opportunities to Ether as much as it does to Bitcoin. He added that he anticipates the ETH/USD exchange rate to hit $3,000 on an anti-inflation narrative.“As things stand, the Federal Reserve has increased the size of its balance sheet from early 2020 to over $8 trillion — a substantial rise,” he explained, adding:And so it appears, Ether accumulation is happening at a rapid pace. According to CryptoQuant, a South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm, the total ETH reserves across all crypto exchanges have dropped by more than half in the wake of its Q2/2021 price correction from $4,384 to $1,700.Ether’s correlation with Bitcoin remains a bottleneck as ETH eyes further highs. Nevertheless, Josh Arnold, a financial analyst associated with Seeking Alpha, highlighted that Ether and Bitcoin are sometimes negatively correlated. A 0.64 correlation efficiency is not perfect.Arnold instead focused on Ether’s price chart structure, noting that the cryptocurrency formed a descending triangle pattern upon topping out in mid-May 2021. Descending triangles are typically continuation patterns that lead the prices in the direction of their previous trends after a small period of consolidation.Arnold noted that Ether bulls need to hold Triangle support to maintain their upside bias or they will risk losing the market to bears. He explained:But given Ether’s resilience against bears, Arnold anticipates that the cryptocurrency might end up rising higher. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-13,"  The latest bearish streak sees $32,600 come and go, with selling pressure in evidence as BTC/USD sheds another 2.7%. Bitcoin (BTC) fell to support which could determine a $30,000 retest on July 13 as bulls failed to make their case for fresh gains.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed another lackluster performance for BTC/USD on Tuesday, with local lows at $32,240 on Bitstamp.Ranging above $33,000, viewed as the support level to hold as a springboard for bullish continuation, seemed shaky at best this week. Monday saw a brief slip below, with the rebound barely holding out for 18 hours.At the time of writing, $32,500 formed a focus, with Bitcoin bouncing below levels one trader says are necessary to hold in order to prevent a return to closer to $31,000.""The critical support that I've derived here is the area around $32,600-$32,900, which you preferably want to see sustain as support to avoid another test of the lows,"" Michaël van de Poppe explained in an update earlier on Tuesday.With that area missing for now, bearish sentiment looked apt to prevail on lower timeframes.Fellow trader Crypto Ed even tweeted charts comparing current price action with the build-up to Bitcoin's bear market capitulation event in December 2018, when it dropped to just $3,100.c'mon bulls, give me reasons why this time it's different@Moonify2 's chart #blameMooni pic.twitter.com/W90xoAAl7yThat said, fundamentals continued to stabilize after seeing local bottoms of their own. The hash rate was above 91 exahashes per second on the day, while difficulty continued to avert a fresh record-breaking drop at this weekend's readjustment.Elsewhere, news that BNY Mellon would be providing banking services for a potential Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Grayscale failed to lift the mood.Related: Strong Bitcoin accumulation spotted as BTC price refuses to fall below $30KA United States ETF has yet to get the regulatory go-ahead, with a total of 1 currently under the microscope.Even if it were to launch, however, opinions are mixed about an ETF's impact on Bitcoin if it were to operate in such a large market. Noting the impact of a U.S. ETF launch on gold in 2005, however, popular Twitter commentator Lark Davis hinted that the direction would be clear.  ""It essentially kick started a 7 year bull run,"" he summarized.Tuesday's forthcoming release of the July consumer price index report, which focuses on inflation, buoyed stocks in contrast to crypto markets.

The CME Bitcoin Futures was up 1.64% from its previous session’s low of $32,600.Meanwhile, the USD index was down about 0.03% ahead of the London opening bell. The index represents the greenback’s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies.Bitcoin and the USD moved inversely during a week of key inflation reports and a crucial congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.On Tuesday, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) expects to post another significant spike in June, highlighting a run-up in inflation as the economy attempts to recover from the coronavirus pandemic slowdown. A Reuters poll of economists noted that the CPI might have increased by 0.5% since May and 4.9% from a year earlier.Many traders bet on Bitcoin against the prospects of higher inflation, partly due to popular narratives that project the flagship cryptocurrency as a hedge against central bank inflationary policies that hurt fiat currencies’ purchasing power.Inflation is killing your savings account. Powering power. #BitcoinIn detail, the Federal Reserve has been running a $120-billion monthly asset purchase program since March 2020 while keeping its benchmark lending rate near zero. As a result, the U.S. central bank’s policies have doubled the size of its balance sheet to more than $8 trillion. Meanwhile, the same period has witnessed Bitcoin spiking by up to 1,528% — from $3,858 to almost $65,000.The cryptocurrency had declined by more than half by the said mid-April peak but sustained its overall bullish bias by relentlessly holding $30,000 as its psychological price floor. The support came extremely handy following the previous two CPI reports showing that inflation jumped to 4.2% in April and 4.9% in May.“The uptick in the CPI readings is an indication that the economy has not healed completely from the pangs of the pandemic, and the crypto market is trailing the negative inflation figures,” Gustavo De La Torre, director of business development at N.exchange, told Cointelegraph. He added that lower Bitcoin prices combined with a mixed economic outlook would drive more investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency.“Should the buy-up intensify, a price push up to $40,000 for Bitcoin may be seen in the short term,” added De La Torre.Additionally, Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of CEX.IO, warned about the Fed’s potential hawkish reaction to further inflation hikes, noting that it might prompt the central bank to unwind its bond-buying program and cut interest rates earlier than expected.“As things stand, the Federal Reserve has increased the size of its balance sheet from early 2020 to more than $8 trillion — a substantial rise,” Anissimov said, adding that lower crypto prices would keep serving as the right hedge against inflationary fears for the time being. He further noted:On-chain indicators continued to point toward an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation. As of the last week’s close, as per Glassnode’s data, entities with little history of selling continued piling up Bitcoin from weaker hands, while net exchange flows dipped into negative territory, suggesting that traders have been withdrawing their Bitcoin from trading platforms to hold.“Retail has been buying heavily for weeks now, but we finally got the uptick in whales that we were waiting for,” noted Will Clemente III, an independent market analyst.

2021-07-15,"  The company said the move was aimed at giving customers “more choice and flexibility"" to purchase crypto. Payment provider company PayPal now allows U.S.-based users to purchase up to $100,000 in crypto weekly.In a Thursday announcement, PayPal said it had increased the crypto purchase limit for certain customers based in the United States from $20,000 to $100,000 per week. The company said the move was aimed at giving users “more choice and flexibility in purchasing cryptocurrency.”PayPal announced it would be moving into the crypto space in October 2020, later allowing eligible customers based in the United States to use cryptocurrencies for trading and payments. Though the company initially announced users would be limited to purchasing $10,000 in crypto each week, the feature launched with a $20,000 limit. The platform has been expanding its features for crypto users since last year, partnering with Coinbase to allow crypto purchases through the major exchange, while the PayPal-owned payments firm Venmo launched crypto trading in April. Before the Venmo announcement, CEO Dan Schulman said he expected the average monthly volume for crypto transactions on PayPal to reach $200 million in a matter of months. Related: PayPal to start letting US customers pay in Bitcoin at global merchantsAccording to analytics site Statista, PayPal had roughly 392 million active user accounts as of the first quarter of 2021. The company has continued to invest in blockchain-focused firms including Blockchain Capital and blockchain intelligence platform TRM Labs."
2021-07-14,"  The Series A fundraiser was led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Variant Fund, Jump Capital, DeFi Alliance and Solana Foundation. Angel investors from Compound, dYdX and Ethereum Foundation also participated.   Cryptocurrency wallet provider Phantom has secured $9 million in Series A financing to launch a new multichain wallet designed to help DeFi users access decentralized applications across multiple blockchains. The raise comes on the heels of a successful beta launch in April of this year that saw 40,000 new Phantom users. The company also secured $500,000 in grants from Serum and Solana during the beta phase. Brandon Millman, Phantom’s co-founder and CEO, said his platform enables users to easily access decentralized exchanges and nonfungible token platforms, explaining: Cryptocurrency wallets are the first point of contact for DeFi users, but the steep learning curve around their use may be impacting broader mainstream adoption. Phantom has prioritized simplicity in onboarding more wallet users. The Phantom application can be installed as a browser extension on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave and Firefox. Saurabh Sharma, a general partner at Jump Capital, said projects like Phantom will help springboard mainstream adoption of DeFi. ""The next phase of DeFi would be focused on onboarding mainstream users and one of the biggest barriers to that is intuitive user interface and workflows,"" he said.Arianna Simpson, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, touted Phantom’s mission to build a ""beautiful, easy-to-use wallet that bridges assets and gives users a seamless experience,"" adding that her firm is excited to work with the crypto startup. Related: Andreessen Horowitz launches biggest-ever crypto venture fund at $2.2BAndreessen Horowitz is one of the largest backers of Solana projects, having co-led Solana Labs’ $314 million private token sale earlier this year.

2021-07-14,"  The latest price declines came after the U.S. inflation rose to a 30-year high in June. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price continued its downtrend Wednesday ahead of the testimony from United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.The spot BTC/USD exchange rate fell to its 17-day low of $31,600 following a 3.46% intraday dip. Meanwhile, CME futures tied to the pair plunged 3.41% to $31,515, extending their week-to-date losses to 9.5%.Bitcoin had powered to $35,000 at the beginning of July, as bulls continued to defend support levels around $30,000 against each downside attempt. Independent market analyst Will Clemente III noted that entities with a low history of selling kept absorbing Bitcoin at lower levels from speculative traders, adding that the strategy is in the process of effectively removing a good BTC supply out of the market.“Given no capitulation event, in my humble opinion, it is a matter of ‘when’ the re-accumulation process will be finished rather than ‘if,’” Clemente wrote. Bitcoin sold off at $35,000 and dropped to near $31,500 during the Wednesday session. One factor that made traders cautious is uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve would respond to the bout of higher inflation — now running upward at its fastest pace in 13 years.In detail, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.9% in June 2021 from the previous month and by 5.4% compared to June 2020. The higher inflation readings honed focus on Powell’s appearance before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday at 9:30 am EST.The central bank chief expects to clarify his position on the ongoing spike in consumer-related inflation. In his earlier statements, Powell has suggested that the Fed should move cautiously unless it sees a “maximum recovery” in the U.S. labor markets. Therefore, with support from some like-minded dovish Fed officials, including New York branch head John Williams, Powell might ignore trimming the Fed’s $120-billion monthly asset purchase program in the wake of strong U.S. growth and high inflation.Meanwhile, Evercore ISI economist Peter Williams forecasted that rising CPI readings would increase tensions among the Federal Open Market Committee’s members. He noted that some hawkish members might demand tapering to begin as early as September, albeit adding that the Fed, in general, would follow a wait-and-watch approach, thinking inflation is transitory in nature.As for Bitcoin, the outlook remains mixed, especially after the cryptocurrency failed to respond to inflation alarms in recent months, China’s crackdown on the crypto sector, increasing regulatory scrutiny, the Fed’s rate hike plans for 2023, and Elon Musk’s anti-crypto tweets.Fortune reported that Bitcoin is marching “on its own drummer,” ignoring the recent spikes in key inflation metrics. That makes the cryptocurrency a doubtful hedge against rising consumer prices.However, Joel Kruger, a forex strategist at London-based investment firm LMAX, thinks differently. The analyst noted that Bitcoin’s long-term prospects remain skewed to the upside because there’s a “legit fear of rising inflation.”“Setbacks more about SOME investors looking at Bitcoin as a risk correlated emerging asset,” he tweeted late Tuesday. Additionally, Greg Waisman, co-founder and chief operating officer of cryptocurrency infrastructure company Mercuryo, offered a more critical outlook. First, he noted that macro investors do not believe in Bitcoin’s true value even against rising inflation. And second, he projected Ether (ETH) as a better cryptocurrency, given its recent run-up against Bitcoin.“Bitcoin is the most expensive and renowned cryptocurrency, but it’s not a cryptocurrency of the present,” Waisman explained, adding:Currently, lackluster volumes and a two-month-old downside move continue to keep Bitcoin in a bearish state.Since May 20, the BTC/USD exchange rate has been trending lower inside a falling parallel channel, rebounding off its support trendline and pulling back lower upon testing resistance. At the same time, the $30,000–$32,000 area has been providing a confluence of additional support.The pair appears to be heading back toward the lower trendline following the latest retest of the Channel’s upper trendline. However, the short target in the current scenario is below $30,000 (toward the Q2 bottom of $28,732).Conversely, a break north of the Channel’s resistance trendline could have BTC/USD test the 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the blue wave) at $35,363 as the next upside target. The area has witnessed sell-offs in the recent sessions.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-14,"  Investors who sold BTC above $30,000 on the way to all-time highs are now buying back in, Ecoinometrics reveals. Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing a “reset” in investor behavior at $30,000 and the trend need only continue to spark a price rise.According to on-chain monitoring resource Ecoinometrics on Tuesday, the only way is “up” for BTC/USD if hodlers continue accumulating coins.Analyzing who bought coins since the start of the latest bull run in October 2020, Ecoinometrics showed that major change is afoot compared to last year.At the start, it was smaller investors, or “small fish,” who were accumulating. This began when Bitcoin passed its previous all-time high of $20,000 and continued all the way up to the new peak of $64,500.At $20,000, however, larger investors began selling, albeit not in sufficient quantities to end the bull run.Whales, on the other hand, added selling pressure once BTC/USD hit $30,000 for the first time. The result, analysts say, was the tipping point at May’s highs.“Apparently $30k is a key level that stopped the trend of coins accumulation by whales,” Ecoinometrics commented.The reason that selling pressure ultimately took over could lie with whale sentiment that Bitcoin was gaining “too much, too soon” and that the market was thus deemed unsustainable.Now that $30,000 has returned, cold feet are nowhere to be found — investors, both big and small, are buying again.“Whales and small fish have started accumulating again while other categories have turned neutral,” the findings continue.That perspective provides a refreshing counterargument to the bearish tone taken by many market commentators over the past few weeks.Related: Bitcoin price will see breakout ‘during this week’ says trader with $38K targetEven the classic stock-to-flow price model has fielded concerns of invalidation, something its creator denies, while on-chain activity has been marked by low volumes and a lack of solid support above $30,000.Calls for a major price move are not in short supply, meanwhile, with hopes for an upward move lingering despite sliding below $32,000 on Wednesday."
2021-07-11,"  Glassnode data reveals that investors with a long-term risk outlook have started accumulating Bitcoin during its recent downtrend. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price remained relatively flat over the weekend, inching closer to $34,000 on Sunday. Nevertheless, BTC/USD has tumbled by almost 50% from its all-time high, near $65,000 in mid-April. But the massive downside move has not deterred investors from betting on the digital asset’s long-term bullish outlook.According to one of the Glassnode metrics, dubbed as Liveliness, the Bitcoin market has been noticing a shift in long-term investors’ “macro hodling behavior.” Hodling represents crypto investors’ ritualized response to market downtrends, a meme-driven investment strategy that originated from a drunken forum post in 2013 and typo. Meanwhile, Liveliness is the ratio of cumulative coin days destroyed to the cumulative sum of all coin days ever accumulated by the network. It varies between zero and 1, with zero representing the highest proportion of dormant Bitcoin supply — i.e., hodling behavior. It shows that the global coin day accumulation has been outpacing coin days destroyed in on-chain activity.Nonetheless, a higher degree of distribution does not necessarily predict bearish cycles. For example, between November 2020 and April 2021, the Liveliness Ratio increased alongside the Bitcoin prices, suggesting that despite lower hodling behavior, the Bitcoin market did not enter a bearish phase. That could be due to massive spikes in trade volumes at the beginning of this year. In the first quarter, Bitcoin trading activity, on the whole, spiked to over $6 trillion, compared to $1.14 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to data obtained from Bitcoinity.Therefore, while the long-term holders started spending their Bitcoin between November 2020 and April 2021, higher trading volumes across all crypto exchanges showed that retail demand absorbed the selling pressure. But by April, as analyst Willy Woo noted, the selling had overrun the normal bull market buying pressure.Speculative participants started selling off their new coins to long-term holders, Woo wrote in a newsletter published on July 2 while referring to a so-called “Rick Astley” chart that studies Bitcoin flows between strong and weak hands. Excerpts:A spike in Bitcoin accumulation sentiment appeared as the cryptocurrency continues to maintain its bullish bias above a strongly held $30,000 support level. The BTC/USD exchange first dropped to the $30,000 level on May 19, during the overall cryptocurrency market crash. Since then, the pair has tested the price floor at least four times, only to witness a strong upside rebound later. That has made $30,000 a psychological support level, which, if broken to the downside, risks crashing Bitcoin’s price to as low as $20,000.Joel Kruger, a forex strategist at London-based investment management group LMAX, noted earlier this week that Bitcoin could revisit $20,000, for it remains under the pressure of global market sentiment. The analyst was referring to the latest meltdown in stock markets, on worries linked to the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19. “It would be foolish to rule out the possibility for a drop back below the June low, and we think there would be a risk in that scenario where the #Bitcoin price could revisit the old record high area around $20,000,” he added.

2021-07-11,"  Ethereum might be the darling of the blockchain world, but it’s likely that the awaited Eth2 will not attract wider mainstream adoption. Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) is being pegged as the blockchain Messiah of Ethereum. Newsflash: it's not. The long-awaited changes are not expected to solve core issues that are plaguing the network and forestalling wider adoption.Vitalik Buterin, the brilliant mastermind behind the Ethereum blockchain, considers the personnel working with Ethereum as a bigger problem than the actual software, as he stated in a recent interview with Forkast news. While the personnel working on the project may or may not be problematic, it's surely not the only shortcoming. As promising as the new rollout may seem, the kind of software upgrades set to be introduced will not solve the long-term problems plaguing the network from reaching the heights Buterin and his disciples once envisioned.Related: The great tech exodus: The Ethereum blockchain is the new San FranciscoEthereum currently runs on a proof-of-work (PoW) system that enables only up to 15 transactions per second or so — double that of the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain — and is widely considered as impractical for building any expansive decentralized finance, or DeFi, ecosystem. As a result, gas fees are incredibly high on Ethereum. Because so few transactions can be processed per second, the price to process faster becomes competitive. Research by Dune Analytics shows that 2-5% of transactions on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) failed due to complications such as insufficient gas prices.Related: Ethereum fees are skyrocketing — But traders have alternativesAnother core issue the Ethereum platform faces, but often disregards, is poor user experience (UX) design. As a result, the average users who may be interested in engaging with decentralized finance applications (DApp) or a nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace, for example, will avoid doing so because most user interfaces are not only not intuitive, but also lack sufficient educational resources to give users the know-how to use the platform.Users are expected to set transaction fees in gas price and gas limits for transaction processing. Yet, how many users realistically know this without going down the intense rabbit hole of cryptocurrency jargon and information? Insider Intelligence reported that 25% of United States adults don’t understand or know how to invest in digital currencies. How could users be expected to know without access to effective educational tools, for example, that sending payment from two separate wallets to the same receiving address would not cause a nonces conflict? In all likelihood, the vast majority of regular users would not be aware in the slightest of such a problem to begin with.Related: Mass adoption of blockchain tech is possible, and education is the keyTo respond to these long-standing issues, Ethereum's overseers announced the launch of Eth2 as a series of upgrades over its existing model, which would include switching to proof-of-stake (PoS) and sharding. The proof-of-stake concept states that people can mine blocks and validate transactions according to how many coins they hold. The Ethereum Foundation announced that it expects the switch to PoS to be completed by the end of 2021. As the Ethereum Foundation explained in a recent blog post, “the energy requirements remain unchanged” compared with the old PoW system.Related: When will Ethereum 2.0 fully launch? Roadmap promises speed, but history says otherwiseSharding is expected to take much longer and, according to Ethereum’s website, “shard chains could ship sometime in 2022 depending on how quickly work progresses” after the current Ethereum mainnet merges together with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system. Sharding is the process of splitting a database horizontally in order to spread the load, reducing network congestion and increasing transactions per second. The shard chains are expected to give Ethereum more capacity to store and access data.The new upgrades are designed to be more environmentally conscious and speed up the processing of transactions. In addition to these upgrades, the blockchain programming language is expected to change from the traditional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to one that can be adopted by developers using C++ or Rust, which will simplify coding directly into a browser. While the infrastructural upgrades may prove beneficial in some capacities, such as improving the flow of transactions, they still miss the mark.First, Ethereum 2.0 has been in the works for years, leaving many users wondering when the actual full upgrades will happen. Proof-of-stake is intended to reduce mining cost and energy consumption, however, network throughput will only increase if block times are reduced and/or block sizes are increased. Furthermore, sharding only helps applications that can run independently from one another and only need to be synced every once in a while. But DeFi's inherent decentralized and open-sourced nature means that the sharding-style processing would need to run transactions through a relay chain and thus slow down the entire process.Related: Where does the future of DeFi belong: Ethereum or Bitcoin? Experts answerMore importantly, on the user experience front, Ethereum is still lagging behind to a large extent that remains unsolved by the rollout of the Eth2 upgrade. While Ethereum claims it will release upgrades that solve the transaction processing speeds and high gas fee problem to a degree, the foundation shows a blatant disregard for issues that, if resolved, would open doors for a greater number of users who are currently daunted by Ethereum’s unfriendly interface.Even when the expected upgrades will eventually roll out, users will still have difficulty setting transaction fees in gas prices and gas limits for transaction processing. Even beyond Ethereum, the UX issues are not unique to Ethereum and are common on other blockchains that use EVM protocols, such as Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. Because other Ethereum-compatible chains that use EVM protocol suffer from the same UX issues, it is difficult to envision a future in which even EVM-based chains will also be truly accessible to the average user.In addition to the lingering gas fee parameter issues, transactions have long confirmation times that typically result in delays, asynchronous transaction submission and confirmation notices. Quite often a user will not receive confirmation right after the transaction, leaving too much uncertainty regarding whether the targeted recipient received the transaction. For users who are accustomed to instantaneous results on the web, like e-commerce situations, this is a strange and frustrating user experience.Ethereum might be the darling of the blockchain world, but at some point, the hype may just turn out to be hot air, and it’s very likely that the long-awaited upgrade will not attract wider mainstream adoption. It’s not clear if the expected changes will be able to deliver the promises of the Ethereum Foundation's head honchos. Until Ethereum can solve some of the deeper issues at heart, it's doubtful that Eth2 will make a significant difference for anyone outside of the community of Ethereum enthusiasts. For now, Ethereum 2.0 is not a much-needed game-changer, but rather a cosmetic upgrade.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2021-07-10,"  How realistic is it that a majority of Bitcoin investors are aiming for a $100,000 BTC price by the end of 2021?  Bitcoin (BTC) investors are known for being bullish, and even during 50% corrections like the current one, most analysts remain optimistic. One reason for investors' endless optimism and belief in infinite upside could be BTC's decreasing issuance and the 21 million coins fixed supply limit.However, not even the most accurate models, including the stock-to-flow (S2F) from analyst Plan B, can predict bear markets, crashes, or FOMO-induced (fear of missing out) pumps. Traders usually misinterpret these concepts as value and price expectations can be easily mistaken.Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum, even if BTC maximalists think so. Therefore, its price action heavily depends on how many dollars, euros, and yuans are in circulation and interest rates, real estate, equities, and commodities. Even global economic growth and inflationary expectations impact the risk appetite for people, companies, and mutual funds.Regardless of what these valuation models predict, price is exclusively composed by the market participants at any given moment. Opposite to what one might expect, data from CryptoQuant shows only 2.5 million Bitcoin currently deposited on exchanges. Compare this to the 10.7 million that hasn't been moved in the last 12 months according to 'HODL wave' data, and we can say that long-term holders have no say in the price.As the difference between value (subjective) and price (historical and objective) becomes more evident, it is easier to understand why some investors expect $100,000 or higher targets for the end of 2021. However, to correctly interpret what odds are being placed for those prices, one needs to analyze the calls (buy) existing in the options markets.Although the call (buy) options vastly dominate compared to the protective puts, this is common for almost every asset class on longer-term expiries. However, a call option with a $50,000 strike should be more representative than a $200,000 one because their prices will be noticeably different.At the time of writing, a right to acquire (call option) Bitcoin for $50,000 on Dec. 31 is valued at $4,350. Meanwhile, the same instrument using a $200,000 strike price costs $415, which is roughly ten times lower.Cointelegraph previously explained how $100,000 to $300,000 strikes should not be taken as precise analysis-backed price estimates. Investors typically sell higher-strike calls while simultaneously buying the more costly call option with a lower strike.In short, assuming that investors are exclusively buying the ultra-bullish call options is naive and usually wrong. However, even the option strategies involving selling those options are generally neutral-to-bullish.According to the Black & Scholes model, the current $1,185 price for the $100,000 call option has a 13% mathematical probability. It is worth noting that this methodology considers the price exclusively on Dec. 31 at 8:00 am ET and does not count the $99,999 price as a success.Despite this, there is strong evidence that professional traders are still valuing the year-end $100,000 options. It might seem far-fetched right now, but Bitcoin's volatility opens room for surprise, especially considering that there's still half a year ahead.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-07-03,"  Bitcoin prices remain under pressure in the $30,000-$40,000 zone as traders brace for the 16,000 BTC worth of GBTC shares unlocking in July. Whether a potential sell-off of shares tied to a multi-billion dollar Bitcoin (BTC) investment fund could crash the cryptocurrency's spot prices has turned into a hotly debated topic among the analysts in the space.The argument concerns Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world's largest digital assets manager that allows institutional investors to gain indirect exposure in the Bitcoin market through its product, GBTC. Investors purchase GBTC shares directly via Grayscale in daily private placements by paying in either Bitcoin or the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, investors can sell their GBTC shares only after a six-month lockup period in secondary markets to other parties. Therefore, they anticipate liquidating at a premium when the market price at the time of sale crosses above the native asset value (NAV).On the other hand, liquidating GBTC shares when the market price has dipped below the NAV brings losses. So if investors decide to dump their GBTC holdings, they would have to do so for a financial casualty. That is because the share has been trading at a discount, i.e., under its NAV, since February 24, 2021.Some analysts, including strategists at JPMorgan, believe that accredited investors will sell at least a portion of their GBTC holdings after the July unlocking period, thus weighing further on the ongoing Bitcoin market downtrend.“Despite this week’s correction, we are reluctant to abandon our negative outlook for Bitcoin and crypto markets more generally. So despite some improvement, our signals remain overall bearish,"" said Nikolas Panigirtzoglou, the lead strategist at JPMorgan, in a note to clients.Nevertheless, other analysts believe that the event will flush sellers from the market in July, opening up both volatility and bullish potential to break new all-time highs.It is the GBTC shares that were scooped up by investors at around 40% premium in December 2020, explained Panigirtzoglou. The month saw Grayscale Bitcoin Trust attractive inflows of $2 billion, followed by $1.7 billion in January.That means about 140,000 Bitcoin worth of shares will get unlocked by the end of July. About 139,000 Bitcoin have already been released between mid-April to mid-June, a period that also coincided with spot BTC/USD's crash from around $65,000 to as low as $28,800.Lyn Alden, the founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, noted the correlation between the spot Bitcoin price crash and its Grayscale's GBTC unlocking periods, noting that the same could happen as more shares get unlocked in July.Alden hinted that the correlation pointed to a deceleration of Grayscale's ""neutral arbitrage trade.""In arbitrage trade, institutional investors (like hedge funds) borrow Bitcoin to purchase GBTC shares. Then, after the lock-up expires, these investors sell GBTC shares to secondary markets to retail investors, typically for a premium. Then, they return the borrowed Bitcoin to their lenders and pocket the difference.""Part of the run-up in the second half of 2020 was due to the Grayscale neutral arbitrage trade, sucking in a ton of bitcoin,"" Alden tweeted late Monday, adding:But, according to David Lifchitz of ExoAlpha, arbitrage strategy might have contributed to but did not cause the Bitcoin price plunge. The chief investment officer noted that the real GBTC arbitrage trade strategy is for investors with deep pockets. That is because they would require to hold the short Bitcoin position during the GBTC lockup period — the overtime costs would risk offsetting the price differential that was arbitrage away.""And for the simple buyers of GBTC shares at a discount vs. BTC who didn't sell short BTC against, their profit depends on the price at which they bought GBTC: if they bought between $40K and $60K, they are in the red today... and may not want to sell just yet and lock-in their loss,"" he told Cointelegraph.Michael Sonnenshein, the chief executive of Grayscale, told Barron's that investors buy the GBTC shares with a medium- to long-term outlook. So they might not want to dump their holdings immediately upon its unlocking.Sonnenshein added:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-07-03,"  The ratio of Bitcoin price to hash rate presents bulls with a long wait, as hash rate is still migrating. Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded its biggest mining difficulty drop of nearly 28% on July 3, but one model suggests that the BTC price will not bottom until October.In a series of tweets on July 2, investment manager Timothy Peterson flagged the relationship between Bitcoin price and hash rate as arguable evidence that the dip is not over.Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped by an estimated 27.94% on Saturday at block height 689,472, the biggest in its history. As Cointelegraph previously explained, the drop is in response to the ongoing miner migration out of China and the subsequent loss of hash rate.For miners still at work, the decrease will be something of a profit boost — difficulty automatically accounts for changes in hash rate, making it more attractive to mine when it drops. Miners in flux are not expected to return to their craft completely for several months. In that time, difficulty will likely increase again as hash rate goes up — more competition and more power competing for the same set reward.It is a classic mantra among Bitcoiners that “price follows hash rate” — but if that is true, one model charting the phenomenon is painting a sobering picture of future price behavior.Peterson noted that the relationship between price and hash rate is “useful” when it comes to marking macro price tops.An accompanying chart shows spikes in 2013 and 2017, corresponding to tops which held for an entire four-year halving cycle. 2021 looks similar, but since the May capitulation, the relationship has been trending towards 1 — the point at which the Bitcoin price should have fully “corrected.”“Based on the current trend in P(h), this bubble would finish collapsing by 31 October,” Peterson summarized. In other words, the return of miners is likely to prevent further price dip episodes of the magnitude seen recently, but bulls may still need to wait longer than desirable to see higher levels return.An important caveat came from Peterson, who cautioned that there are “many things wrong” with such a simple model, and that he himself does not use it.The model is not the only source catering to a return to form for Bitcoin in the latter half of the year.

2021-07-02,"  Lawmakers seem to be attempting to establish a legal framework behind a Central Bank of Iran decision for people to only use crypto from state-licensed mining operations for payments. A new bill drafted by the Iranian Parliament Commission on Economy aims to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies within the country while providing a clearer legal framework for miners.According to a Friday report from the Tasnim News Agency, lawmakers drafted a bill titled “Support for cryptocurrency mining and organizing the domestic market for exchanges,” which the country’s parliament first announced on June 23. If passed, the legislation would make Iran’s central bank the regulatory authority for the exchange of cryptocurrencies in the country. Under the bill, all cryptocurrencies could be prohibited within Iran for payments except for a ""national"" one — purportedly a central bank digital currency or tokens minted in the private sector. However, the statement could refer to crypto mined by licensed entities within Iran, as the Central Bank of Iran has previously said it was attempting to ensure all digital currencies traded in the country are mined from local farms.The proposed bill would also officially place crypto mining under the regulatory purview of the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, allowing it to grant licenses for farms. Licensed mining companies with partial or full control of a power plant could apply with the country’s Energy Ministry to sell off any surplus electricity. Crypto mining as an industrial activity has been legal in Iran since 2019 as long as the miners are licensed and regulated accordingly. However, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced in May that mining operations would be prohibited until September. Authorities have seemingly been stepping up their raids on unlicensed miners tapping into the power grid as the country faces increasing demand for energy in the summer months.Related: Iran’s central bank says officially mined crypto can be used to pay for importsIn June, Rouhani said Iran needed to legalize cryptocurrency to preserve and protect national interests at a meeting of his cabinet’s Economic Coordination Board. The president called for a joint study between agencies in capital markets and news to establish a legal framework for cryptocurrencies."
2021-07-02,"  Ethereum flips Bitcoin by another metric as active addresses plummet.  The number of addresses active on the Bitcoin network has crashed roughly 60% in the past six weeks from 1.3 million to roughly 500,000.The collapse in activity has seen Ethereum overtake Bitcoin by the number of active addresses, with the Ethereum network hosting roughly 200,000 more active wallets than Bitcoin on Friday.It is the third time in a month that Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin by the metric, also happening on June 5, 2021, and June 6, 2021. The previous time Ethereum was in the lead was at the beginning of 2017.Twitter analyst Mr. Whale — known for his bearish takes — also noted that Bitcoin’s active addresses have fallen to their lowest level since April 2020 based on a weekly moving average.Bitcoin’s active addresses on the blockchain network just plunged to its lowest level since April 2020. This data is bearish. It shows demand for Bitcoin is drying up very quickly. pic.twitter.com/vdmwagbvtmSeveral factors may be contributing to the aggressive drop in active Bitcoin addresses, including the more-than-50% sell-off that followed Bitcoin’s (BTC) all-time highs in May and subsequent sideways market action and the massive crash in network hash rate amid China’s latest crackdown on local Bitcoin mining operations.Ethereum’s active addresses increased by more than 9% over the past week to tag 700,000 despite the price of Ether (ETH) falling more than 10%. However, active Ethereum addresses are still down 22% from their early April peak of 900,000.Active addresses is the latest metric by which Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin, with Blockchain Center’s Flippening Index estimating Ethereum’s transaction fee revenue leads by more than 300%, while total transaction count is ahead by nearly 500%.However, Bitcoin has also reclaimed a lead in both trading and transaction volumes after recently falling behind Ethereum.According to a June 23 report from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, the total number of unique addresses interacting with DeFi protocols has continued to climb since May, suggesting decentralized finance (DeFi) activity was rising despite the broader crypto meta-trend.Related: Almost twice as much ETH locked in DeFi as on exchanges: GlassnodeThe data shows a nearly 40% increase in the number of wallets that have interacted with DeFi protocols since the start of May, pushing the total user count up to more than 2.9 million. As such, persistent demand for DeFi from new users may explain Ethereum’s recent strength in network activity relative to Bitcoin’s."
2021-07-01,"  A test of support levels is on the cards after resistance takes control of Bitcoin’s latest attempt to hit $40,000. Bitcoin (BTC) faced fresh losses on Thursday as attention focused on an impending test of an important support zone. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked a 5% decline in BTC/USD overnight on Wednesday.As Cointelegraph reported, eyes are now on an area between $32,300 and $33,000 to provide a floor. On Thursday, popular trader Michaël van de Poppe reiterated the need for that zone to hold.The pair had reversed after reaching nearly $36,700, erasing most of the gains it had sealed in a run-up that began on the weekend.“Would be nice if Bitcoin creates a higher low here & flips $33K for support to sustain the momentum,” he said in his latest Twitter update.Exchange orderbook data broadly supported the thesis, with buyer interest lined up at an area around $32,000, while $37,000 seller resistance remained intact on Binance.At the time of writing, BTC/USD was falling steadily toward the zone of interest, circling $33,300.Current spot price weakness thus continues the “tale of two Bitcoins” scenario that has emerged over the past week or so.Specifically, on-chain indicators are broadly bullish and insisting that a recovery is already underway, while BTC price action has failed to comply.Related: Biggest-ever mining difficulty drop: 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekSummarizing comments from statistician Willy Woo on Tuesday, analyst William Clemente III pointed to a reaccumulation of BTC as being the main takeaway from the past month’s volatile price period.Woo had uploaded Bitcoin liquid supply ratio data showing strong hands adding to their positions while new investors panic sold.“Imo this chart is the easiest way to visualize what’s taken place over the last month under the hood,” Clemente III commented.

2021-06-30,"  Ethereum's EIP-1559 upgrade is fast approaching, but derivatives data shows traders are less than optimistic about ETH's short-term prospects.  Derivatives data shows that Ether (ETH) traders are feeling less bullish when compared to Bitcoin (BTC). Even though the altcoin captured a nearly 200% gain in the first half of 2021 versus Bitcoin's modest 22% price increase, traders seem to be more affected by Ether's recent underperformance.Institutional flow also backs the decreased optimism seen in Ether derivatives, as ETH investment vehicles suffered record outflows this past week while Bitcoin flows began to stabilize. According to data from CoinShares, Ether funds experienced a record outflow of $50 million this past week.Take notice of how Ether is underperforming Bitcoin by 16% in June. The London hard fork is scheduled for July, and its core proposal — dubbed as EIP-1559 — will cap Ethereum's gas fees. Therefore, the price action could be related to unsatisfied miners as the network migrates out of Proof-of-Work (PoW).For this reason, Ether investors have reason to fear because uncertainties abound. Perhaps miners supporting a competing smart-contract chain or some other unexpected turn of events could further negatively impact Ether price.Whatever the rationale for the current price action, derivatives indicators are now signaling less confidence when compared to Bitcoin.In healthy markets, the quarterly futures should trade at a premium to regular spot exchanges. In addition to the exchange risk, the seller is 'locking up' funds by deferring settlement. A 4% to 8% premium in the December contracts should be enough to compensate for those effects.A similar effect occurs in almost every derivatives market, although cryptocurrencies tend to present higher risks and have higher premiums. However, when futures are trading below this range, it signals that there is short-term bearish sentiment.The above chart shows the Bitcoin December futures premium recovering to 3.5% while Ethereum contracts failed to follow. While both assets displayed a neutral-to-bearish indicator, there's evidence that the altcoin investors are less optimistic about a short-term recovery.Related: Key Bitcoin price indicator flashes its 'fifth buy signal in BTC history.'Another thesis that could negatively impact Ether's premium is the impact of a potential negative 30% performance from Bitcoin. Filbfilb, an independent market analyst and the co-founder of the Decentrader trading suite, said that a 30% crash in the Bitcoin could prompt altcoins to drop twice as hard.Clem Chambers, the chief executive of the financial analytics website ADVFN, also predicted another potential leg down, which would repeat the late-2018 crypto winter period. Chambers claims Bitcoin could capitulate and fall back towards $20,000.While the overall market sentiment is neutral-to-bearish, it seems sensible to predict a more daunting scenario for Ether, including uncertainties from the transition to Proof-of-Stake (POS).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-30,"  The Puell multiple — and Bitcoin's price — can still dip further before a rebound takes hold, cautions analyst Rekt Capital. Bitcoin (BTC) kept traders guessing with rangebound action on June 30 after a push beyond the $37,000 resistance ended in rejection.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a day of reversal for BTC/USD on Wednesday, with the pair down 4.5% to hit $34,500.After accelerating upward the day before, Bitcoin ran out of steam at $36,630 and began a retracement that erased most of its gains.For popular trader Crypto Ed, even the run higher was lacking in substance, and after the subsequent correction, a bounce was sorely needed to preserve the bull case.""Stronger move down=start of move to green,"" he commented alongside a chart showing a downside target of $26,900.Others heralded the Wyckoff price analysis method, which is currently popular for Bitcoin, as providing key insights into what the short-term price direction could be.Fellow trader Michaël van de Poppe, in his Wyckoff depiction, highlighted an area just above $32,000 as the do-or-die support level for BTC bulls.""That would generate a higher low & strength towards further upwards momentum,"" he told Twitter followers.The Wyckoff method has not been as eagerly accepted by everyone, with Crypto Ed on June 30 criticizing the general lack of understanding of the method's principles and the potential for incorrect conclusions as a result.For on-chain indicators, the story was conversely still bullish, even as one particular indicator left room for another BTC price low.The Puell multiple, a classic indicator for catching undervalued periods in Bitcoin's lifespan, is currently sitting in its broad ""undervalued"" zone for just the fifth time ever.Related: Institutional investors aren't buying Bitcoin at 50% of all-time highs… for nowAs discussed by analyst Rekt Capital in a dedicated video on June 30, the Puell multiple suggests that miners have sold to cover costs, and given its descent to the ""undervalued"" zone, a price bottom could soon appear.The previous four bottoms in the indicator, nonetheless, did not exactly line up with price bottoms, as those generally came shortly after the indicator had reversed upward.""The fact that we're in this green P [Puell] multiple region doesn't necessarily mean to us that we're at the very bottom,"" he commented, referring to the latest chart."
2021-06-29,"  Double-figure returns not uncommon for altcoins on Tuesday, with Bitcoin facing major resistance on its way toward $40,000. Bitcoin (BTC) tackled resistance at $35,000 on Tuesday as upward momentum began to resurface throughout cryptocurrency.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting 24-hour highs of $35,780 on Bitstamp on Tuesday.The pair put in 4.5% gains on the day, restoring confidence to traders who were previously afraid of another major market correction.As Cointelegraph reported, the weekend was a rags-to-riches story for Bitcoin, which bounced at $30,000 to stage an impressive comeback going into the new week.For popular trader Crypto Ed, there was now little reason to hold a doomsday-style view on BTC’s price action.“Current BTC bears are the same who were convinced BTC would drop below $10k back in September 2020,” he argued in his latest update. For analyst Rekt Capital, the potential likewise remained for further upside on the back of the most recent weekly close.“Great price-strength stability at a key Weekly support level for BTC,” he summarized. A look at orderbook data from Binance, the largest exchange by volume, showed strong support remaining in place at $30,000 but less presence of buy interest between that level and spot price around $35,500.Sellers, on the other hand, remained at both $37,000 and $40,000.Altcoins, meanwhile, were keen to capitalize on Bitcoin’s newfound strength, broadly outperforming BTC gains on the day. Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, was up 9% at the time of writing, trading at nearly $2,200.Related: Active Bitcoin miners now 'unlikely' sellers thanks to profit boost — DataTraders were keenly eyeing the potential for a fresh installment of “alt season” should Bitcoin add to its losses or make more cautious gains. “Looking good so far,” Scott Melker told Twitter followers. Bitcoin’s market cap dominance stood at 46% on Tuesday, slightly down, while the overall cryptocurrency market cap was $1.455 trillion."
2021-06-28,"  The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency also surged in tandem with positively correlated Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset. Ether (ETH) prices reclaimed $2,000 on Monday, increasing expectations that the latest rebound would serve as a cue for further upside moves based on bullish fundamental and technical outlooks.The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surged up to 4.96% to $2,083 ahead of the London opening bell. Its gains appeared as a part of an overall upside correction that started late Saturday. At that time, bids for ETH/USD had fallen to as low as $1,717.41.On Sunday, the pair closed the session at $1,984.71, following it up with another spike above $2,000 on Monday, a level that traders consider as a backstop for further bullish momentum in the Ethereum market.“Ethereum targets $2,045 first,” noted Twitter-based independent market analyst Research 25/7, adding that the cryptocurrency is now surfing on the “recovery wave.”Market analyst Edward “Teddy” Cleps also highlighted a bullish scenario for Ether as he referred to his custom-made “secret EMA cloud.” The analyst refers to the said exponential moving average indicator periodically to identify potential entry and exit levels in a trade.Last week, ETH slipped below the EMA cloud’s lowermost wave support. This week, the cryptocurrency reclaimed it, prompting Cleps to predict an extended upside momentum.$ETH penetrating the cloud and 2000$ again - life iz gud. pic.twitter.com/1d2h1ejuw0Ether prices pushed higher also as it maintained its positive correlation with Bitcoin.Bulls took encouragement from Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its upside bias above a closely watched support level of $30,000. The flagship cryptocurrency climbed to an intraday high of $35,301 ahead of the London session Monday. Meanwhile, its latest move upside prompted other correlated assets to rise in tandem, including Ether.“We’re seeing the $30,000 level on Bitcoin being defended quite well with a number of tests at that level over the past month,” Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Luno, told Bloomberg. More upside tailwinds in the Ethereum market came in the wake of its major protocol upgrade in July. Dubbed as the London hard fork, the upgrade expects to transform Ethereum from an energy-intensive proof-work network to a speedier, “eco-friendly” proof-of-stake network.The fork will introduce new Ethereum Improvement Protocols (EIP) that propose to make its fee structure cheaper and its blockchain more scalable to handle a higher number of transactions. The two issues have acted as bottlenecks for Ethereum’s adoption even as it remains the highest-utilized blockchain across the booming stablecoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.In general, London hard fork’s core proposal — dubbed as EIP-1559 — will cap Ethereum’s gas fees while moderating the volatility of the network’s transaction fees.The #ethereum London hard fork consists of 5 EIPs :1.EIP-1559: Fee market change for $ETH 1.0 Chain2.EIP-3554: Difficulty Bomb Delay to December 20213.EIP-3529: Reduction in Refunds4.EIP-3541: Reject new contracts starting with the 0xEF byte5.EIP-3198: BASEFEE opcodeEIP-1559 also brings in the so-called “scarcity” feature to the Ethereum ecosystem, which is currently the primary bullish factor in the Bitcoin (BTC) markets. The cryptocurrency actively competes with the United States dollar to become the best hedge against inflation, thanks to its limited supply cap of 21 million units. Unlike Bitcoin, Ether does not have a supply limit, making it less appealing as a store-of-value asset against unlimitedly printable fiat currencies. Ether’s circulating supply was 116,471,411.37 ETH at the time of publication. EIP-1559 proposes to burn a portion of the fee collected from Ethereum users, thus introducing a mechanism to put active ETH tokens of supply for the first time since its launch. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to PoS means replacing miners with validators. To become a validator on the Ethereum network, a user needs to lock at least 32 ETH in the network’s official smart contracts; that also reduces ETH’s active supply. Therefore, analysts see it as a sign of another bull run providing the demand for ETH tokens increases against a decreasing supply.“Based on the scheduled London hardfork (EIP 1559) upgrade and the proposed migration to Ethereum 2.0, investors are bound to start backing the coin the more,” Domenic Carosa, founder and chairman of Banxa — a fiat-to-crypto gateway solution — said. The Ethereum 2.0 smart contract has attracted roughly 5.93 million ETH (worth around $11.9 billion) to this date.Carosa added that he expects Ether to have reached $4,000–$5,000 by the end of December 2022 while raising alarm about the cryptocurrency’s short-term bias conflict.We are neither bull nor bear, the executive told Cointelegraph, adding that more mature investors have started buying Ether near its sessional lows with a long-term holding perspective. Nevertheless, the accumulation is not aggressive enough to continue the upside run near term.Ether was fluctuating inside a historically relevant range defined by $2,153 as interim resistance and $1,964 as interim support. At the same time, the cryptocurrency watched its 200-day simple moving average (200-day SMA; the saffron wave) as its price floor for a potential rebound move to the upside.That puts Ether en route to $3,500 in the coming sessions, considering Wedge’s apex around $1,500 as the point of upside breakout. The pattern’s maximum height is shy of $1,800.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-06-27,"  Bitcoin’s consolidation in the current range could create trading opportunities for ADA, SOL, MATIC and KLAY over the coming days. The U.S. core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 0.5% in May, below market estimates of 0.6%. However, when compared year-over-year, the PCE index surged to 3.4% recording its largest gain since 1991.While the U.S. Federal Reserve expects inflation to be transitory, analysts at BofA differ in their estimation. The bank anticipates U.S. inflation to remain high, in the 2% to 4% range, for the next two to four years and believes the Fed will hike rates in the next six months, barring a financial market crash.If inflation remains elevated, investors are again likely to focus on Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge their portfolios. A CoinShares report published on June 21 said it was unsure of inflation in the next five years but believed ""adding Bitcoin and other real assets as a prudent measure to protect portfolios from the tail-risk of out-of-control inflation.""Although near-term risk remains, select cryptocurrencies could offer short-term trading opportunities to traders. During a bear phase, traders may focus on booking profits at regular intervals instead of waiting for windfall rallies. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may turn short-term bullish in the next few days.Bitcoin dropped to the $28,000 to $31,000 support zone on June 26 but the positive sign is that the bulls again bought this dip. This suggests that buyers are accumulating at lower levels.The bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($35,148). If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the selling pressure may be reducing. The positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) is also pointing to a possible relief rally.A break above the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a move to the stiff overhead resistance zone at $40,000 to $42,451.67. The 200-day simple moving average ($43,505) is just above this zone, hence the bulls may find it difficult to climb above it.This points to a possible consolidation between $28,000 and $42,451.67 for the next few days. The longer the price trades in this range, the stronger will be the next breakout from it. The trend will favor the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $28,000.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are attempting to form a higher bottom at $30,000. The 20-EMA has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the sellers are losing their grip.If the bulls sustain the price above the 20-EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the 200-SMA. A breakout of this resistance could attract further buying that may push the price to $40,527. This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $30,000.Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the $1 support on June 22, indicating strong accumulation near this level. However, the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.39) on June 24 and 25, suggesting that bears are defending the resistance.The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand. The ADA/USDT pair may witness a long liquidation if the bears sink and sustain the price below $1. That could pull the price down to $0.68 and then to $0.40. Conversely, if the bulls can thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term trend has tilted in favor of the bulls. The pair could then rise to $1.60 and then to the stiff overhead resistance at $1.94.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. If the bulls push the price above $1.40, it will indicate the possibility of a short-term bottom formation. The pair could then attempt to rally to $1.60 and then to $1.88.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or $1.40 and plummets below $1.20, it will suggest a lack of buyers at higher levels. The pair may then drop to the critical support at $1.The long tail on Solana’s (SOL) June 22 candlestick shows that traders are aggressively defending the 200-day SMA ($20). However, the relief rally could not scale above the 20-day EMA ($33), indicating that bears are selling on rallies.The buyers are currently attempting to form a higher low at $26.65. If they can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the SOL/USDT pair could pick up momentum and move up to the downtrend line and then to $44.However, the downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears will have other plans. They will try to defend the 20-day EMA and sink the price below $26.65. If this support cracks, the pair may drop to $21.10.A strong rebound off this support will suggest that bulls are accumulating on dips. The pair could then consolidate between $21.10 and $44 for the next few days.The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. This balance may tilt in favor of the bulls if they push and sustain the price above $33.Such a move could clear the path for a move to the downtrend line and then to $42. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level or $33, The bears will try to break the support at $26.65. If that happens, the advantage may tilt in favor of the bears.Polygon (MATIC) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($1.29) for the past few days but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip to the May 23 low at $0.74. This suggests a lack of sellers at current levels.If the bulls regroup and push the price above the downtrend line, it will indicate that the correction may be over. The MATIC/USDT pair could then rise to $1.71 and later to the psychological resistance at $2.However, the bears may have other plans. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that sellers have the upper hand. If they sink the price below $0.92, the pair may drop to the $0.74 to $0.68 support zone.The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively. A strong bounce will suggest accumulation at lower levels and the bulls may then try to push the price above the downtrend line.The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative zone indicate advantage to the bears. If they sink the price below $1, the pair may drop to $0.92.Conversely, if the price rebounds off $1, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will suggest that bulls are trying to make a comeback. The pair may pick up momentum on a breakout and close above $1.25.Related: 'Absolutely right' to think of Bitcoin as the new gold — Mexico's 3rd richest manKlaytn (KLAY) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($1.02) for the past many days but the RSI is showing a positive divergence. This indicates that the sellers may be losing their grip.If the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, it will be an indication that a trend change is possible. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the recovery in the $1.24 to $1.29 zone.If the price turns down from the overhead zone but does not dip below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls are trying to make a comeback. A breakout of the resistance zone could attract buyers who may then challenge the 200-day SMA ($1.51).A breakout and close above the 200-day SMA will indicate that the downtrend may be over in the short term. This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $0.72.The 4-hour chart shows the KLAY/USDT pair is trading inside a descending channel. The bulls had pushed the price above the channel and the 200-SMA but they could not sustain the higher levels. If the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-EMA, the pair may again try to rise above the channel and the 200-SMA. If that happens, the pair may start a new uptrend that could reach $1.62.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks below $0.86, the decline could extend to $0.72.

2021-06-26,"  According to an independent market analyst, altcoin holders face the risk of facing twice more losses if the Bitcoin price corrects by another 30%. Altcoin traders and investors should look for cover if Bitcoin (BTC) undergoes major price declines.So believes Filbfilb, an independent market analyst and co-founder of Decentrader trading suite. In a tweet published late Friday, the pseudonymous entity said a 30% crash in the Bitcoin market could prompt altcoins to drop twice as harder.When Bitcoin consolidated between $50,000 and $60,000 in the March-May period, altcoins exploded. Similarly, the recent correction in the Bitcoin market, which witnessed the flagship cryptocurrency falling from circa $65,000 to as low as $28,000, also had altcoins crash; still, to the levels, they held as support when Bitcoin was stuck in the $50K-$60K range.Filbfilb noted that altcoins have been facing a so-called ""catchup risk,"" hinting that even a small downside shift in the Bitcoin market could move altcoins twice lower. The statement appeared as Bitcoin prices plunged to $30,173 following a 15.58% week-to-date downside correction.""[Altcoins], therefore, carry significantly more downside risk than Bitcoin with [BTC/USD] threatening lows,"" tweeted Filbfilb. ""If bitcoin were to fall lower, losing another 30% worst case, I'd expect [altcoins] to correct to do 2x worse from here.""Bitcoin's declines across May and June pushed down its year-to-date performance to 5.71%. Meanwhile, while top-cap altcoins fell in tandem, their YTD returns fared far better.  For instance, Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, dropped by a little over 60% from its mid-April peak of $4,384. Nevertheless, its YTD returns came out to be 141% as of publishing time. Similarly, Dogecoin's YTD profits were 4,112% even after falling by almost 80% from its record high of $0.76.So it seems, altcoins provided better profit-taking opportunities to their holders than Bitcoin did. As a result, investors could offset their losses in the Bitcoin market by simply selling their altcoin profits for fiat and/or rotate the funds back into BTC.Of late, Bitcoin has been able to avoid a deeper pullback below $30,000 despite repeated attempts. Many analysts, including Mercuryo founder Alexander Vasiliev, sees Bitcoin's bullish resilience as a signal that it would eventually breakout above $40,000 and rise to its previous high levels near $64,000 in the mid to long term.However, some analysts who were previously bullish on Bitcoin have flipped their bias in the wake of the cryptocurrency's latest bearish correction.For instance, Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of the multi-billion dollar investment firm Guggenheim Partners, told CNBC on Friday that he expects Bitcoin to fall to $15,000.In February, just as Bitcoin was tearing through $30,000-resistance, Minerd has predicted its price to hit $600,000.Clem Chambers, the chief executive of financial analytics website ADVFN.com, also flipped bearish for Bitcoin, noting that Bitcoin could fall back towards $20,000 owing to capitulation sentiment. He wrote in his SeekingAlpha article:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-06-24,"  Bitcoin price briefly traded above $35,000 as the stock market hit new highs and Paraguay aims to become the second country to adopt BTC as legal tender.   Bitcoin (BTC)  price received a boost as news that lawmakers in Paraguay plan to present a bill to make BTC legal tender spread across Twitter. Shortly after the unconfirmed news surfaced on Twitter, Bitcoin price rallied to $35,289 before slightly pulling back below the key short-term resistance level. Congratulations Paraguay   • a bill has been submitted to make #BITCOIN legal tender • reading likely to occur on July 14th• they wish to be a crypto hub• promotion of green energy mining • some interest from Argentina & Brazil now tooWhile the cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index still indicates a sentiment of Extreme Fear, it’s worth noting that the measure has risen from 14 on June 23 to 22 on June 24 as traders begin to view the drop below $29,000 and Bitcoin's rising open interest as signs that the current corrective phase may have ended. While traders' sentiment may have improved slightly, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman suggested that investors could be waiting for the $6 billion in Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) quarterly futures and options to expire on June 25 before making a more decisive move. The crypto market wasn't the only market to rally today. Traditional markets also rose to new highs after U.S. President Joe Biden revealed that he had reached an agreement on a $953 billion bipartisan infrastructure spending plan with the Senate. Following the announcement, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each rallied to new record intraday highs and closed the day up 24.65 points and 97.98 points respectively, while the Dow gained more than 322 points on the day. As one would expect, altcoins also surged higher as Bitcoin price and traditional markets moved higher. Ether (ETH) rallied back above the psychologically important $2,000 level, while Tron (TRX) and Celo gained 26% and 28% respectively. CELO's move appears to be driven by the listing of its Celo Euro (cEUR) stablecoin on KuCoin exchange. Prior to the recent price rise, VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for CELO on June 22. The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for CELO climbed into the green and reached a high of 73 on June 22, one hour before its price began to spike 56% over the next day. The VORTECS™ Score turned green again on June 24, reaching a high of 74 as CELO began to rally another 25%.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.4 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 46.6%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-06-23,"  Bitcoin’s quick recovery to $34,800 ignited a rally in altcoins, boosting the total crypto market capitalization by $76 billion. Cryptocurrency traders received a reprieve from bearish market conditions on June 23 as Bitcoin’s (BTC) brief recovery to $34,880 triggered a rally in altcoins and hope that a wider market recovery will occur if the path laid out by the Wyckoff distribution model rings true. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by nearly $230 billion between June 20 and June 22 but it has managed to regain roughly $76 billion in value on June 23 and now sits at $1.365 trillion as some traders viewed the correction as a dip-buying opportunity.The market cap for Bitcoin fell by $68 billion, or roughly 11% of its total value, on June 22 but has since recovered all losses and is actually higher now than it was before yesterday’s flash crash, sitting at $630 billion at the time of writing. According to ""CL"", a pseudonymous trader on Twitter, further cause for optimism can be found in the record surge in futures open interest at Binance.hint onewe're seeing unprecedent pace of open interest growth on Binance, currently at 57,000 BTC it is at an all time high https://t.co/OuZX7YbukO pic.twitter.com/nSe7tq3KdXBitcoin's bounce off its swing lows was welcomed by altcoins and data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro shows the majority of tokens in the green today.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, the biggest gainer so far has been Cybervein (CVT), which at one point saw its price surge as much as 112% on the 24-hour chart but has since pulled back to $0.0187, representing a gain of 62% since June 22. The second-best intraday performer is ANKR, which rallied 72% from $0.047 to $0.082. According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for ANKR were favorable for some time prior to the market-wide pullback on June 22. The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for ANKR had been in the green in the week prior to June 2, and reached a high of 71 on June 21, around ten hours before the price rebounded from the sell-off and increased by 72%.Other notable performances identified by Cointelegraph Markets Pro include a pair of 25% gains from VeThor Token (VTHO) and Flow, while the market’s most popular meme token Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 20%.

2021-06-22,"  Downward selling pressure sees Bitcoin swiftly take out $30,000 support as Binance users report technical difficulties. Bitcoin (BTC) fell under $30,000 on Tuesday as the latest BTC price dip took the largest cryptocurrency below a significant “line in the sand.”Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD crashing through $30,000 support, shedding 6% in an hour and hitting its lowest levels since late January.After dropping from $41,000 a week ago, Bitcoin has seen multiple rapid bursts of downward volatility in recent days, culminating in Tuesday’s $30,000 breach. As Cointelegraph reported, the breakdown was widely anticipated by traders, some of whom were already calling for $25,000 and even lower.China and the associated media attention surrounding its mining purge appeared to be the main driver of bearishness despite widespread arguments that the shake-up would actually benefit Bitcoin in the long term. “How is more Bitcoin mining power moving to the  and the West a bad thing?” David Marcus, head of Facebook’s F2 project, queried on Monday.  At the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at around $29,000 amid heavy volatility, bouncing at $29,600 on Bitstamp. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, reportedly began experiencing technical problems as the price action unfolded.Binance orderbook data showed buyers lined up at $25,000, with events taking out the $30,000 positions visible in the latest representation from monitoring resource Material Indicators."
2021-06-21,"  Bitcoin is too slow when compared to Ethereum and other proof-of-stake networks, argued Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. IOHK CEO and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson has argued that Bitcoin (BTC) sits at a significant competitive disadvantage due to its slow speeds and will be usurped by proof-of-stake networks. In a five-hour podcast with computer scientist and AI researcher Lex Fridman the Cardano founder argued that proof-of-stake networks offering superior speed and functionality over the original cryptocurrency, stating:“You have to upgrade the damn thing!” Hoskinson exclaimed, regarding Bitcoin’s underlying proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and emphasizing that Bitcoin’s programmatic utility lags behind its competitors.Hoskinson also criticized the Bitcoin community for being reluctant to innovate beyond the cryptocurrency’s base layer, also describing Bitcoin’s second-layer scaling solutions as “highly fragile.”However, Cardano’s founder argued that Ethereum has grown to rival Bitcoin’s network but has a nimble development culture that embraces evolution.“What’s really cool is that Ethereum does not suffer that problem [...] It's getting to the point where it has the same network effect as Bitcoin, but the community has a completely different culture. They love evolving and upgrading,” he said, adding:Hoskinson, however, did acknowledge the battle for crypto dominance is a “much more complex game” than competition between Bitcoin and Ethereum, asserting that many other blockchains are now vying for major blockchain market share, unsurprisingly naming Cardano among others."
2021-06-20,"  The only way is (more or less) up for BTC price action, the analyst insists, offering a potential 2021 high of $450,000. Bitcoin (BTC) could trade at an eye-watering $450,000 by the end of 2021, while $135,000 would be the “worst-case scenario”That’s according to analyst PlanB, who on Sunday released his latest sentiment-busting bullish BTC price prognosis.Well known as the creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price forecasting models, PlanB has repeatedly bucked the overall market mood in recent weeks and months.Even as BTC/USD sees multiple retests of lows from months past, the analyst — and his models — remain firmly fixed on a far brighter mid-term goal for the largest cryptocurrency.Now, even the “worst-case scenario” for Bitcoin would still see it trade at $47,000 in August. A slight reversal in September places the minimum target at $43,000 for that month only to be followed by $63,000 in October — near current all-time highs. Things then heat up, with $98,000 on the cards in November and a giant $135,000 by the end of the year.As such, Bitcoin is still four months from rematching its all-time high — a prediction that nonetheless beats some bearish models currently circulating from traders. These include Josh Rager, who this week claimed that $64,500 may well have been this price cycle’s top — something PlanB has specifically renounced on multiple occasions.“Wait until you seen my base case and best case scenarios! OK, a hint: best case Dec $450K,” he added in comments about what Bitcoin could be capable of in 2021.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, the weekend is seeing problematic moves by Bitcoin.Sunday’s low stood at $33,337 on Bitstamp at the time of writing, with BTC/USD shedding 5% on the day and reversing most of the previous week’s gains.Calls for a further leg down are growing from various sources, with Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, being the latest high-profile voice going short.“Biggest bubble in world history getting bigger,” he warned about the overall macro market climate on Saturday. Such an event would echo March 2020, with commentators continuing to note the constant all-time highs on equities markets regardless of noise from central banks."
2021-06-19,"  Downside risks for BTC price are also heightened due to the recent dollar bounce. The ghost of stock market crash is back again to haunt Bitcoin (BTC).It happened last in March 2020. Back then, the prospect of the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic led to lockdowns across developed and emerging economies. In turn, global stocks crashed in tandem, and Bitcoin lost half of its value in just two days.Meanwhile, the U.S .dollar index, or DXY, which represents the greenback's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, has now climbed by 8.78% to 102.992, its highest level since January 2017. The huge inverse correlation showed that investors dumped their stocks and Bitcoin holdings and sought safety in what they thought was a better haven: the greenback. More than a year later, Bitcoin and stock markets again wrestle with a similar bearish sentiment, this time led by a renewed demand for the U.S. dollar following the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone. Namely, the U.S. central bank announced Wednesday it will start hiking its benchmark interest rates by the end of 2023, a year earlier than planned.Lower interest rates helped to pull Bitcoin and the U.S. stock market out of their bearish slumber. The benchmark cryptocurrency jumped from $3,858 in March 2020 to almost $65,000 in April 2021 as the Fed pushed lending rates to the 0%-0.25% range.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index rose more than 95% to 4,257.16 from its mid-March 2020 peak. Dow Jones and Nasdaq rallied similarly, as shown in the chart below.And this is what happened after the Federal Reserve's rate-hike announcement on Wednesday...Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index jumped to its two-month high, hinting at a renewed appetite for the greenback in global markets.Popular on-chain analyst Willy Woo said on Friday that a stock market crash coupled with a rising dollar could increase Bitcoin's bearish outlook. ""Some downside risk if stonks tank, a lot of rallying in the DXY (USD strength) which is typical of money moving to safety,"" he explained. Michael Burry, the head of Scion Asset Management, also sounded the alarm on an imminent Bitcoin and stock market crash, adding that when crypto markets fall from trillions, or when meme stocks fall from billions, the Main Street losses will approach the size of countries.""The problem with crypto, as in most things, is the leverage,"" he tweeted. ""If you don't know how much leverage is in crypto, you don't know anything about crypto.""Burry deleted his tweets later.Away from the price action, Bitcoin's adoption continues to grow, an upside catalyst that was missing during the March 2020 crash.On Friday, CNBC reported that Goldman Sachs has started trading Bitcoin Futures with Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank headed by former hedge fund tycoon Mike Novogratz. The financial news service claimed that Goldman's call to hire Galaxy as its liquidity provider came in response to increasing pressure from its wealthy clients.Related: Hawkish Fed comments push Bitcoin price and stocks lower againDamien Vanderwilt, co-president of Galaxy Digital, added that the mainstream adoption would help Bitcoin lower its infamous price volatility, paving the way for institutional players to join the crypto bandwagon. Excerpts from his interview with CNBC:Earlier, other major financial and banking services, including Morgan Stanley, PayPal, and Bank of New York Mellon, also launched crypto-enabled services for their clients.Referring to the question ""are we in a bear market?"" Woo said that Bitcoin adoption continues to look healthy despite the recent price drop. The analyst cited on-chain indicators to show an increasing user growth and capital injection in the Bitcoin market.Of primary interest is capital rotation from stablecoins back into the crypto markets (I'll say that's mainly BTC since alt coins are reducing in dominance).All of that dry powder sitting on the sidelines has started flowing back in. pic.twitter.com/v1jRDMD1smHe also noted that the recent Bitcoin sell-off merely transported BTC from weak hands to strong hands. Woo reminded:"
2021-06-14,"  Bitcoin price is still 38% away from its all-time high, but a handful of technical indicators suggest bulls are gathering strength. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price saw a bullish turn of events on Sunday as the price broke out to $39,252, but many analysts are still on the fence when it comes to determining whether the digital asset is ready to continue its uptrend. To date, the crypto market remains on edge and is two months removed from Bitcoin’s all-time high near $65,000. A market analysis from Delphi Digital identified a “major head and shoulders pattern” that could “spell more short term pain if BTC dives below $30,000.”With that in mind, now is a good time to review some key data points to gain a greater perspective on where Bitcoin’s price could go next. A 50% decrease in price over the past two months may seem extreme to those unfamiliar with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, but it comes as no surprise to the long-term hodlers who have seen multiple drawdowns of an even larger magnitude over the last decade. As seen in the chart above, a drawdown of 70% or greater is not uncommon for BTC, especially following a significant run-up in price, hinting that the possibility for further pain is still a threat as bulls battle bears in the mid-$30,000 range. The rapidly falling prices sent new and old Bitcoin holders running for the sidelines, resulting in traders selling at a loss according to Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) data highlighted by cryptocurrency analyst Filbfilb. In the past couple of days, signs of a SOPR reset have appeared, indicating that average wallets are now selling at a profit again. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index (CFGI) has also reached its lowest level since the March 2020 sell-off initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The high levels of fear currently being experienced by a majority of traders have many sitting on the sidelines as concerns of further losses remain a legitimate possibility.For the contrarian investors, however, low scores on the index are a signal to “be greedy when others are fearful,” as Warren Buffet would say, and the chart above shows that buying during high fear moments tends to be a good entry-level.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin’s impending death cross could be a contrarian buy signalWhile it’s true that Bitcoin has seen its price fall more than $30,000 over the past two months, it’s important to note that the amount it has fallen as well as its current price are nearly double the previous all-time high set in 2017, shining a light on just how significant the rally has been over the past six months. On-chain analysis from Decentrader shows that an “oversold” signal was recently triggered, “suggesting that BTC may soon be ready to turn around and move to the upside.”The active addresses sentiment indicator compares the 28-day change in price, shown by the orange line, with the 28-day change in on-chain active addresses, which is represented by the band of grey lines.The orange line moving from below the dotted green line back up into the active address change band is considered a bullish signal, and this most recently occurred on Thursday, indicating the possibility of a turnaround in the market. According to Rekt Capital, a popular analyst on Twitter, Bitcoin is still on a path to realize a new all-time high.The #BTC Halvings (blue) occur in the year prior to a new Candle 1And Candle 1 is where $BTC experiences the most explosive growthWhatever the FUD towards BTC is right now won't change the long-term effect that the BTC Halving has on Bitcoin's pricehttps://t.co/1NTrPs8wfW pic.twitter.com/F7C9P6ehMOFor now, perhaps it’s best to just take a break from staring at charts and worrying about which way Bitcoin will choose. The long-term outlook remains strong as countries like El Salvador have begun choosing BTC as legal tender and more people become interested in cryptocurrency.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-06-13,"  AAVE, KSM, ALGO and TFUEL are showing signs of strength while Bitcoin bulls attempt to push BTC price over $38,000.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price continues to be range-bound between $30,000 and $40,000 level for the past few days, which is not necessarily a bearish sign.Generally, after a sharp fall, the price tends to consolidate as the asset transfers from weaker hands to stronger hands. After the transition is complete, the asset breaks out and starts a new uptrend. Usually, the longer the price consolidates in a range, the stronger the next trending move will be. Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone said on Saturday that Bitcoin’s declining supply was a positive sign, which could act as a “bullish ace” for its move higher “if past patterns hold.” Yoni Assia, CEO of eToro, also told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could see a sharp rise “over the next three to five years, as there are still 5 billion people in the world that basically don't have good local currency.” Related: Bitcoin price could hit $85K in months as indicators flip bullish — report.Therefore, investors should not be discouraged by the muted price action in the short term. Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong and are likely to result in a new uptrend in the future.As crypto markets consolidate, let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.Bitcoin turned down from the resistance line of the descending triangle on Jan. 12 and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,586). This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance line.The longer the price stays below the 20-day EMA, the greater the chances of a drop to the lower levels. If bears sink the price below $34,600, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $33,400 and then to $31,000. A break and close below $31,000 will complete a descending triangle pattern, which has a target objective at $19,549. However, it is unlikely to be a straight drop to the lower levels because the bulls will attempt to stall the decline in the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone.This negative view will invalidate if the price continues to move up and rises above the resistance line of the triangle. Such a move could open the gates for a rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($44,709), which is again likely to act as a stiff resistance.A break above the 50-day SMA will suggest that the correction could be over and the bulls will gradually try to start a new up-move.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have been crossi each other and the relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint, indicating that bulls are trying to make a comeback. A breakout and close above the resistance line of the triangle will signal that demand exceeds supply. If the bulls sustain the price above the triangle, a new up-move could begin.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the resistance line and breaks below $34,000, it could signal a minor advantage to the bears. That could pull the price down to the critical support at $31,000. A bounce off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels and that could keep the pair inside the triangle for some more time.Aave is trading inside a large range between $280 and $581.67 for the past few months. The bulls have successfully defended the support of the range on five previous occasions, hence the buyers are likely to buy the dip once again.If the price rebounds off the current level with strength, it will suggest that the bulls continue to accumulate on dips. The buyers will then try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($344). If they succeed, the AAVE/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($414), which may act as a stiff hurdle.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the pair could consolidate between $280 and $414 for a few days. On the contrary, a break above the 50-day SMA will clear the path for a northward march toward $581.67.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the $280 support. That will embolden the bears who will then try to pull the price down to $208.09 and then to $160.The 4-hour chart shows the bears had pulled the price below $280 but they are struggling to sustain the lower levels. However, the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $266.68, the pair could start its downward journey. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line. Such a move will suggest the correction is over and the pair could then rise to $500.Kusama (KSM) has been witnessing volatile moves in the past few days. Although the bulls pushed the price above the $480 overhead resistance on June 9, they could not sustain the higher levels and the price dipped back below the level on June 10. This shows that bears are selling on rallies.However, the buyers have not allowed the price to break below the 20-day EMA ($388). This suggests that the sentiment is turning positive as the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day EMA. The rising 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a minor advantage to the bulls. The buyers will now make one more attempt to push the price above $480. If they succeed, the KSM/USD pair could rally to $537 and then retest the all-time high at 625.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below $360. That could pull the price down to $280.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are trying to defend the trendline support. However, the 20-EMA has turned down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating the bears have the upper hand.If the sellers sink the price below $380, the pair could drop to $342. A break below this support could result in a decline to $280. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push the price above $429. That could attract buying, pushing the pair to $480.Algorand (ALGO) bounced off the trendline on June 12 and rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.97), which suggests the bulls are buying on dips. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the selling pressure has reduced.The price action of the past few days has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $1.15. If the bulls manage to sustain the price above $1.15, the ALGO/USDT pair could rally to the target objective at $1.63.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $1.15, the pair may extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakdown and close below the trendline will nullify the bullish view and open the gates for a drop to $0.80 and then $0.67.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are attempting to push the price above the downtrend line. If they can sustain the breakout, the pair could rise to $1.15. A breakout and close above this resistance could start a new uptrend.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price below the trendline. If they succeed, it will signal the start of a deeper correction.Theta Fuel (TFUEL) soared to a new all-time high at $0.679 on June 9 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. That was followed by a sharp pullback to the 20-day EMA ($0.41) on June 12.The strong rebound off the 20-day EMA shows the sentiment is positive and traders are aggressively buying on dips. The bulls will now try to push the price to the all-time high where they are likely to encounter stiff resistance from the bears.If the price turns down from the all-time high, the bears will make one more attempt to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction.Alternatively, if buyers propel the price above the all-time high, the TFUEL/USDT pair could resume the uptrend, with the next target objective at $0.85 and then $1.The 4-hour chart shows the pair rebounded strongly off the $0.40 support, which suggests accumulation at lower levels. However, the relief rally is facing resistance just below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.57.This suggests that the bears have not given up yet and are selling on rallies. If the price dips below the 20-EMA, the bears will try to pull the price down to $0.40. If that happens, the pair may consolidate between these two levels for a few days.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will indicate the sentiment is positive and the bulls are not waiting for a deeper fall to buy. That will increase the possibility of a break above $0.57. The pair could then rise to retest the all-time high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-13,"  On-chain data suggests that Bitcoin is staging a recovery like in December 2018 and March 2020. Bitcoin (BTC) is still below a key moving average, and that is “not a bullish sign,” says a new report, but signs of a rebound have finally arrived.In its latest market update released on Friday, trading suite Decentrader highlighted three on-chain indicators calling for an imminent bullish continuation for BTC/USD.Bitcoin has now spent almost a month below its 200-day moving average (DMA). This is concerning, Decentrader warns, and external factors such as geopolitical sentiment continues to weigh on sentiment.“Bitcoin has kept the market on its toes as it continues to range between weekly support at $32,000 and near term resistance of the 200DMA currently at $42,000,” the update summarized.Bitcoin continued to range over the weekend, at the time of writing trading near $36,000 amid few signs of quashing resistance closer to $40,000.Fortunately, however, several measures of on-chain strength now suggest that the bounce from a bearish phase within an overall bull market is now underway.These are well-known — active addresses, sentiment, spent output profit ratio (SOPR) and stock-to-flow deviation. The two latter have been extensively covered by Cointelegraph.Active addresses, meanwhile, measures whether Bitcoin is overbought or oversold at a certain price point relative to the number of active addresses on the blockchain.Like SOPR, the indicator is currently in the same position as just after the bear market floor in December 2018 and the crash of March 2020. As such, if history repeats itself, the only way is up.“We received the same signal yesterday, suggesting that $BTC price was oversold relative to active addresses on-chain and could now be ready to bounce back over the coming weeks,” the update explained.Also on the cards is a rally back to the stock-to-flow trajectory line, something that its creator, PlanB, said would pose a “surprise” were it not to happen.Related: BTC price doesn’t care about El Salvador? 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekAmid hopes that BTC/USD will still hit $100,000 this year, Decentrader predicts that it may only be a matter of months before Bitcoin is back on track.“While we may not rally so hard and fast this time, fundamentally nothing has changed with how Bitcoin works, nothing is broken, we are just experiencing a lot of bad media coverage after a strong rally at the start of the year,” the company concluded."
2021-06-11,"  Bitcoin and most altcoins could be gearing up for a few days of range-bound action as bulls buy on dips and bears sell on rallies. Bitcoin’s (BTC) failure to rise above the critical $40,000 to $42,000 resistance zone is keeping crypto traders on tenterhooks. Some analysts view the sharp rebound from $31,000 level as a sign of accumulation at lower levels while others believe the failure to cross above the overhead resistance indicates that Bitcoin is still not out of the woods yet.JPMorgan’s cryptocurrency market analysts, led by global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, pointed out that after the recent fall, the Bitcoin futures market has shifted from contango to backwardation for the first time since 2018. The analysts believe this is a warning of a possible bear market, similar to the one seen in 2018.While Bitcoin’s price remains subdued, one of the fundamental reasons to own Bitcoin received a shot in the arm when the U.S. inflation numbers rose to their highest levels since 2008. If inflation remains high, institutional investors may consider investing in Bitcoin to hedge their portfolios.Related: Bitcoin traders eye ‘crucial’ $38K level as BTC price action consolidates higherWhat are the levels that may suggest the downtrend could be over? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin turned down from the resistance line on June 10 but the bears have not been able to sustain the price down below the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,604). This suggests that buyers are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA.If buyers propel the price above the resistance line, it will nullify the developing bearish descending triangle pattern. The failure of a bearish setup is a bullish sign as it traps several aggressive bears who are forced to close their short positions, resulting in a short squeeze.That could result in a rally to $42,451.67 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($45,271). Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $42,451.67, the BTC/USDT pair could correct to $31,000 and consolidate in this large range for a few days.The trend will shift in favor of the bears if the pair turns down from the current level and breaks below the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone.Ether (ETH) rose above the 20-day EMA ($2,581) on June 9 but the bulls could not build upon this strength. The price again turned down on June 10, suggesting that bears are selling on every minor rally.If bears sink and sustain the price below the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could witness renewed selling that could pull the price down to $2,079 and then to $1,728.74.However, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) has been taking support near 40, suggesting a range-bound action in the short term.If the price turns up from the current level, the pair may move up to the 20-day EMA and then extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA ($2,929) will suggest the downtrend could be over.Binance Coin (BNB) rose above the 20-day EMA ($358) on June 9 but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. The bears pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA on June 10. However, the positive thing is that the bulls successfully held on to the trendline support.The bulls will now try to propel the price above $378.77. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the stiff overhead resistance at $433. A breakout and close above this resistance could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($478).A breakout and close above this level will suggest the downtrend could be over. This positive view will be negated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the trendline. That could pull the price down to $291.06 and then to $211.70.Cardano (ADA) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($1.61) on June 10, indicating that the sentiment remains negative. The bears will now try to sink and sustain the price below the trendline support. If they succeed, the developing ascending triangle pattern will invalidate. This could result in a drop to $1.24 and then to the critical support at $1. A strong rebound off $1 could keep the ADA/USDT pair range-bound for a few days.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the current level and breaks above $1.63, the pair could rally to $1.94. A breakout and close above this resistance will signal that bulls are back in command. That could result in a retest of the all-time high at $2.47.Dogecoin’s (DOGE) rebound off the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.34) on June 10, suggesting that bears are selling on every minor relief rally.If bears sink the price below the neckline, it will complete the bearish head and shoulders pattern that could result in a drop to $0.21. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively. If the price rebounds strongly off this level, the DOGE/USDT could retest the neckline. If the price turns down from this resistance, the possibility of a break below $0.21 increases. That could result in a drop to $0.10.This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the moving averages. That could open the gates for a rally to $0.47.XRP turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.93) on June 10 but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This indicates that bulls are buying on every minor dip.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is trying to sustain above 40, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could rally to $1.10. A break above this resistance could challenge the 50-day SMA ($1.20). This view will invalidate if the price fails to break above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that bears are not willing to relent. That could result in a drop to the $0.75 to $0.65 support zone.The bulls tried to push Polkadot (DOT) back into the ascending channel on June 10 but failed. This shows that bears are selling at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink the price below $19.60. If they manage to do that, the DOT/USDT pair could start its decline to $17.50 and then to the critical support zone at $15 to $13.63. A bounce off this zone could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price bounces off the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA ($22.81), a retest of $26.50 is possible. A breakout and close above this overhead resistance could result in a rally to $31.28.The bulls tried to propel Uniswap (UNI) above the 20-day EMA ($25.58) on June 9 and 10 but failed. This shows the bears have not thrown in the towel yet. The sellers will now try to sink the price below the $21.50 to $20.46 support zone.If they succeed, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand and the UNI/USDT pair could be on its way to $16.49 and then $13.04. On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $21.50, the pair may again try to rise above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, a move to $30 is likely. If the pair turns down from this resistance, the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $30 to signal the end of the downtrend.Litecoin (LTC) has been trading close to the 20-day EMA ($176) for the past few days but the bulls have not been able to push the price above it. This suggests that bears are defending the 20-day EMA aggressively.The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. If buyers drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($241). The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is attempting to sustain above 40, suggesting the selling pressure is reducing.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the triangle. That could sink the pair to $118.03 and then to $100.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is witnessing a tough tussle between the bulls and the bears near the critical level at $616.04. The bulls are buying the dip below $616.04 but the bears are defending the 20-day EMA ($667).The 20-day EMA is flattening out but the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting the bulls are trying to make a comeback. A breakout and close above the downtrend line will indicate that demand exceeds supply. That may result in a rally to the 50-day SMA ($905).Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are selling on every minor rally. A break below $542.63 will open the gates for a further fall to $468.13.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-11,"  Sustained higher levels mean a retreat to $30,000 is looking less and less essential to preserve the bull market. Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a higher range on Friday, with analysts keen to see which critical levels would fall next.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD retaining $35,000 support overnight on Thursday while so far staying clear of $40,000.A push higher had taken the pair to $39,000 before the consolidation phase began, but overall, Bitcoin was yet to make a decisive move up or down on longer timeframes.For popular trader Rekt Capital, $38,000 needed to be flipped to support.“The ~$38,000 area for BTC is the one to watch right now,” he noted on Wednesday, noting its significance in the current consolidation cycle.Since then, volatility has waned, but broad calls for a significant market drop may ultimately go unanswered.As Cointelegraph reported, fellow trader Crypto Ed was among those forecasting a return to near $30,000 as Bitcoin’s next move. On Friday, however, this was looking increasingly unlikely.“Printed a couple of HL’s and starting to think we don’t complete that leg lower,” he told Twitter followers, with a chart likewise highlighting a crunch point at near $38,000.Related: Bitcoin price hits stock-to-flow rebound level not seen since 2017 all-time highA look at buy and sell positions on largest global exchange Binance confirmed resistance at $38,500 and $40,000, respectively. By comparison, little noticeable support was in place much above $30,000. On altcoins, the picture was more disheartening. Traders were faced with losses of around 4% across major tokens on Friday, with only Amp (AMP) positing noticeable daily gains of 17%.Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance thus improved as it drifted higher, hitting 44% from under 42% earlier in the week."
2021-06-09,"  Bitcoin’s sharp rebound from its recent swing low suggests traders are aggressively accumulating BTC and altcoins on major dips. Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is more likely to rally to $40,000 than slump to $20,000. This bullish outlook seems to be shared by traders as Bitcoin initiated a sharp recovery today.On-chain data also suggests that long-term holders (LTH) have again started accumulating Bitcoin after booking profits during the rally from $10,000 to $64,000. The total number of Bitcoin held by these long-term holders is 2.3 million more than what they held at the peak of the 2017 bull market. This shows the veteran traders remain bullish about the future prospects of Bitcoin.  CoinShares' Monday “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report shows institutional investors pulled out $141 million from Bitcoin investment products last week. However, Ether (ETH), XRP and Cardano (ADA) products witnessed net inflows, suggesting money is exiting Bitcoin and entering select altcoins.However, the outflow from Bitcoin products is minuscule compared to the massive $4.2 billion that was pumped into them in 2021. This shows that most investors have held their positions despite the recent fall.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine whether the correction is over or if the prices could fall further.Bitcoin broke below the trendline of the symmetrical triangle on June 7, indicating the uncertainty resolved in favor of the bears. However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.The bulls continued their purchase today, which seems to have trapped the aggressive bears who may have sold on June 7. However, the BTC/USDT pair is still not out of the woods yet because the relief rally is likely to face resistance at the 20-day exponential moving average ($37,925).If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The next leg of the downtrend could begin after the bears sink the price below the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone. Such a move may open the doors for a decline to $20,000.However, the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a bullish divergence, indicating the bearish momentum is weakening. The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the 20-day EMA, which could extend the relief rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($45,896).Ether once again turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 7, indicating the bears are aggressively defending the zone between the resistance line and the 50-day SMA ($2,927).However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick shows the bulls are buying on dips to the support line of the symmetrical triangle. This suggests the ETH/USDT pair could remain stuck inside the triangle for a few more days.The next trending move could start after the price breaks above or below the triangle. The buyers will have to propel the price above the 50-day SMA to gain the upper hand. Alternatively, a break below $2,079.94 could signal advantage to the bears.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the trendline on June 8 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The long tail on the daily candlestick suggests that bulls are attempting to defend the trendline.If buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA ($389), the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $433. A breakout and close above this level will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective at $608.60.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the trendline, it will suggest that bears have overpowered the bulls. That could result in a drop to $257.40 and then to $211.70.Cardano dropped below the 50-day SMA ($1.57) on June 8 but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. The long tail on the June 8 and June 9 candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.The flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This balance will shift in favor of the bears if the price breaks below the trendline. The ADA/USDT pair could then drop to $1.24 and then to $1.On the contrary, if the buyers propel the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.64), the pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $1.94. A breakout and close above this level could push the pair to the all-time high at $2.47.Dogecoin (DOGE) broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.36) on June 7 and fell to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. The bulls are trying to defend this level as seen from the long tail on the June 8 candlestick and the strong rebound today.However, unless the bulls push the price above the moving averages quickly, the bears will once again try to sink the DOGE/USDT pair below the neckline. If they succeed, the pair could decline to $0.21 and then to $0.10.The marginally downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.39). The pair could then move up to $0.47.XRP broke below the $0.88 support on June 7, suggesting supply exceeds demand. However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick indicates that bulls are trying to defend the $0.75 to $0.65 support zone.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.99) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears are in control. The relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, the possibility of a break below the support zone increases.If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to $0.45 and then to $0.39. Conversely, if the bulls push the price above $1.10, it will suggest the buyers are back in the game and a rally to the downtrend line is possible. Polkadot (DOT) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($24.99) on June 7 and broke below the trendline of the ascending channel. This suggests that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.If the bulls fail to push the price back into the channel within the next few days, further selling could be expected. The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.If the DOT/USDT pair breaks below $19.60, the next stop could be the critical support at $15. Conversely, if the pair re-enters the channel, it will suggest strong accumulation at lower levels. A breakout and close above the resistance line of the ascending channel will signal that bulls are back in the game.Uniswap (UNI) dipped below the $21.50 support on June 8 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The long tail on the day’s candlestick shows the bulls are defending the $21.50 level aggressively.The buyers will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($26.81). If they succeed, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $30. This level may act as a stiff resistance and if the price turns down from it, the pair could remain range-bound between $21.50 and $30 for a few days.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment is negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. That will increase the possibility of a break below $21.50. If that happens, the pair could start its journey toward $16.49 and then $13.04. Solana (SOL) turned down from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $43.38 on June 7 but the bears could not pull the price below the trendline. The altcoin rebounded off the trendline on June 8, indicating strong buying on dips.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If buyers thrust and sustain the price above $43.38, the SOL/USDT pair could move up to the 78.6% retracement level at $49.97. Such a move will suggest the recent correction is over. A break above $49.97 could clear the path for a retest of the all-time high at $58.38.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down and plummets below the trendline. A break below $33.60 could result in a decline to $25.70.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke below the $616.04 support on June 7, suggesting the bears are in command. However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick indicates that bulls are trying to defend the $500 to $468.13 support zone.If the bulls can sustain the price above $616.04, the BCH/USDT pair could make one more attempt to rise above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($917).On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level or the downtrend line, then the bears may challenge the critical $468.13 support. A break below this level could extend the decline to the next support at $400.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-09,"  The odds are on for a continuation to $40,000, Mike McGlone argues, but not everyone is so sure. Bitcoin (BTC) is “more likely” to hit $40,000 than $20,000, Bloomberg argues, as the largest cryptocurrency gains 6% in a day.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reclaiming the $35,000 mark amid new bullish forecasts from analysts.In a tweet on Wednesday, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, argued that Bitcoin would sooner see a return to $40,000 than its 2017 all-time highs of $20,000.“Bitcoin Capitulation? $40,000 Appears More Likely Than $20,000,” he wrote. McGlone highlighted Bitcoin meeting its 20-week moving average as providing similar bottom signals to March 2020 — the height of the coronavirus-induced market crash.Moving averages continue to play a key part in concerns over where the BTC price is headed next.Bitcoin has been gaining on the back of news that El Salvador will be the first country in history to make it legal tender.The move is a major counterpoint to the sea of “bad news” triggers that have come from various sources in recent days and weeks, including former United States President Donald Trump calling it a “scam.”As Cointelegraph reported, many market participants still favor a return to bearish price action, such as a further retest of $30,000 or even lower.#BTC update0.5fib level from the latest leg down is crucial imo.Current bounce could be corrective to that 0.5fib level and down from there again.In case the ABC turns into a 1-5, it is opening the gates for more upside towards $42k pic.twitter.com/VweyziWnwyFor McGlone, however, the El Salvador announcement, which first surfaced at last week’s Miami conference, marks an unequivocal turning point.“Woodstock-Like Bitcoin 2021 Miami Backs Mainstream-Adoption View: The June 3–5 Bitcoin 2021 conference further validated our view that Bitcoin has transitioned to a global digital-reserve asset and away from being a speculative crypto,” he tweeted on Tuesday.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $35,000 still while so far not turning the level into reliable support. "
2021-06-09,"  Reduced network activity is resulting in lower fees for Bitcoin and Ethereum as both recede heavily from their all-time highs. The cost of using the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains is on the rapid decline, as evidenced by a 93%–95% reduction in average transaction fees over the past couple of months.Fees are paid to the miners who process transactions on a typical proof-of-work blockchain. The size of the fee depends on the size of the transaction in bytes and how many transactions a coin has gone through in the past (as these need to be checked every time a coin is moved). Supply and demand for space also dictate the size of a transaction fee since blockchains have limited capacity.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum saw their transaction costs surge to all-time highs in 2021 in April and May, respectively, coinciding with their rising coin valuations and price peaks.Bitcoin’s average transaction fee hit $62.77 on April 24 — a figure that exceeded the $55 all-time high from December 2017, which stood for more than three years. By Sunday, fees had fallen as low as $4.38. That marked a 93% reduction and sent Bitcoin’s average fee back to levels not seen since December 2020, prior to 2021’s market pump.The same general pattern was witnessed on Ethereum, where average transaction fees rose as high as $69.92 on May 12. That was another all-time high for the cost of using Ethereum and was undoubtedly fuelled in part by the flurry of activity that accompanied the launch of decentralized finance and the Uniswap exchange, which has long been the biggest consumer of resources on Ethereum.On Sunday, Ethereum’s average fees were as low as $3.44 — a figure not seen since the first day of January 2021 — amounting to a 95% reduction. Fees on both blockchains tend to jump whenever there is a sudden increase to the coin’s price or a new application that increases network usage. As reported previously by Cointelegraph, the transaction count on both Bitcoin and Ethereum is also on the decline. Between January and June, the daily number of Bitcoin transactions fell from around 400,000, to just 175,000. Likewise, the number of daily Ethereum transactions fell from 1.6 million to 1 million between May and June alone, marking a 37.5% drop."
2021-06-09,"  Bitcoin is now officially legal tender in a sovereign state for the first time, but can it exit its bearish price phase? Bitcoin (BTC) headed toward $35,000 on Wednesday, boosted by historic news that El Salvador had made it legal tender. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a swift uptick in BTC/USD on Wednesday as Bitcoin saw its first adoption move by an official state.The #BitcoinLaw has been approved by a supermajority in the Salvadoran Congress.62 out of 84 votes!History! #BtcWhile some celebrated the decision by El Salvador’s parliament, traders remained edgy. As Cointelegraph reported, expectations call for a short-term return to $35,000 before a reversal and deeper BTC price dip takes hold. “Bitcoin printing a higher low, expecting some more bounce today,” popular trader Crypto Ed summarized on Twitter.A starker warning had come from trader Crypto Cobra, who this week repeated forecasts of a significant write-down across cryptocurrency. This, he said, could cost tokens 20%, meaning that Bitcoin would target $25,000.Crypto Ed nonetheless added that a declining United States dollar, which as recently as Monday was on the up, could yet create the conditions for a “miracle” growth spurt in Bitcoin.“All we need for a bullish BTC,” he commented on the latest readings from the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY). Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s renewed upward trajectory had a generally positive knock-on effect for altcoins.A look at the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization showed gains typically reaching 3% on the day, with some exceptions up or down.Ether (ETH) was above $2,500, yet like Bitcoin, still over 5% lower versus its position a week ago. The overall crypto market cap stood at just under $1.54 trillion, with Bitcoin’s dominance at 41.6%."
2021-06-08,"  Breaking $19,000 will be ""very hard"" for bears, say analysts at Whalemap, with this still allowing Bitcoin to dive below the $20,000 highs from 2017. Bitcoin (BTC) edged closer to the significant $30,000 support on June 8 amid predictions that a major crypto correction was imminent.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD making repeated lower lows on short timeframes during June 8.A previous dip took the pair to $32,000 before a brief rebound, with that level subsequently giving way.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was plumbing to levels not seen since May's initial $30,000 correction, with BTC focusing in on $31,500.As Cointelegraph reported, traders have gone on record to predict a fresh capitulation event across cryptocurrencies, something that could shave around 20% off the total crypto market capitalization. Under such circumstances, Bitcoin could trade at $25,000 in the short term.""From a technical point of view its difficult not to see $30k being tested and probably break,"" Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, told Cointelegraph. A look at buy and sell positions on largest global exchange, Binance, shows support lining up at $30,500, with resistance curiously thin below $40,000.For on-chain monitoring service Whalemap, meanwhile, essential support areas for BTC/USD more broadly begin at $28,000.Analysts used the ""cohort-based realized price,"" a metric that extends realized price according to how large a wallet is, along with the prices at which current hodlers bought while Bitcoin was running to its $64,500 all-time highs.""To conclude, there is massive confluence at the 19k level which makes it super hard for BTC to go lower than that,"" the analysts tweeted. Nonetheless, should Bitcoin go below $20,000, it would be the first time in history that the high from a previous bull cycle has been broken."
2021-06-07,"  Bitcoin and altcoins are likely to remain under pressure for a few days but lower levels could attract buying. United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen defended President Joe Biden’s latest massive spending package while speaking to Bloomberg. Yellen said it would be “a plus” for society even if it resulted in a higher interest rate environment.If rates inch higher, traders will explore the best possible options to hedge their portfolios. While gold is down about 2.5% year-to-date, Bitcoin (BTC) is still up 22% during the same period, even after the massive plunge in May.Bitcoin’s outperformance may not go unnoticed and several institutional investors are likely to make it a part of their portfolio along with gold.  London-based asset management firm Ruffer booked a profit of more than $1 billion on an investment of $600 million in Bitcoin. Ruffer’s investment director Hamish Baillie in an interview with The Times said the company bought in November and sold its “last tranche in April.” Baillie said institutional investors, including Ruffer, are likely to continue buying Bitcoin.This suggests that Bitcoin is likely to attract huge institutional interest at lower levels, which may act as a strong floor. The larger the purchases by institutions at lower levels, the higher the price is likely to rally during the next bull phase.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine their next possible trending move.Bitcoin dropped to the trendline of the symmetrical triangle on June 5 but the bears could not break this support. The bulls successfully defended the trendline for the past two days and are attempting a rebound off it today.The buyers will have to push the price above the resistance line of the triangle to gain the upper hand. If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could extend the relief rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($46,784).A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will be the first indication that the downtrend could be ending.However, the downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory suggest advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the triangle, the pair could witness panic selling. That may pull the price down to the critical support zone at $30,000 to $28,000.Ether (ETH) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 4 but the shallow correction shows the bulls are buying on dips. The price has risen back above the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,743) and the bulls are challenging the resistance line of the triangle.If buyers propel the price above the triangle and the 50-day SMA ($2,918), it will suggest the start of a rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72. This level may act as stiff resistance but if the bulls arrest the next decline above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the downtrend could be over.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and slides below $2,550, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to the support line of the triangle. A bounce off this support could extend the stay of the pair inside the triangle.The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the support line of the triangle. Such a move could clear the path for a decline to $2,180.53 and then $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from $433 on June 4 and the bears thwarted another attempt by the bulls to clear the resistance on June 5. This suggests the bears are aggressively defending the $433 level.Although the price traded below the 20-day EMA ($398) for the past two days, the bears could not sink the BNB/USDT pair to the trendline. This suggests that bulls may be regrouping to make another assault at the $433 level.If buyers succeed in driving the price above this resistance, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($492) and then to the 78.6% retracement level at $589.04.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and drops below $365, the pair may correct to the trendline. A break below this support will suggest the bears are back in the game.Cardano (ADA) turned down from $1.88 on June 3 but the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA (1.67). This suggests the sentiment is turning positive and the bulls are buying on dips to the 20-day EMA.The buyers will now have to push the price above $1.94 to gain the upper hand. If that happens, the ADA/UDST pair could rally to the all-time high at $2.47. A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest aggressive selling at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound between the 50-day SMA ($1.56) and $1.94 for a few days.The first sign of weakness will be a break below $1.33. That could open the doors for a further slide to $1.Dogecoin (DOGE) had formed a Doji candlestick pattern on June 5 and 6 near the 20-day EMA ($0.37), indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.If bears sink the price below $0.35, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the neckline of a large head and shoulders pattern. A breakdown and close below the neckline will be a huge negative as that could increase the possibility of a drop to $0.10.However, the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a few days of range-bound action. If the price turns up from the neckline, the pair could rise to $0.47 and remain stuck between these levels for a few days.A breakout and close above $0.47 will be the first sign of strength. It will clear the path for a northward march toward $0.59.XRP’s price is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($1.03) and $0.88 for the past few days. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 44 indicate advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA and breaks below $0.88, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to $0.79 and then to the May 23 low at $0.65.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls propel the price above $1.10. If that happens, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.23) and then to the downtrend line. This is an important resistance to watch out for because a break above it will suggest the downtrend is over.Polkadot (DOT) has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. The altcoin is attempting to bounce off the trendline of the channel and rise above the overhead resistance at $26.50.If that happens, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($31.68) and then to the resistance line of the channel. If the price turns down from the resistance line, the pair may continue to trade inside the channel.However, if the bulls thrust the price above the channel, the momentum could pick up. That will also suggest an end to the downtrend. Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA or the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies to the moving averages. A break below the trendline of the channel will increase the possibility of a drop to $18.41 and then to $15. Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($27.64) on June 4 but the bulls did not allow the price to drop below $25. This suggests a positive sentiment because traders are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.If buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $30, the UNI/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($32.79). This level may again act as a stiff resistance.However, if the bulls arrest the next decline at the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment has turned positive. That will enhance the prospects of a rally to the 78.6% retracement level at $38.15.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below $21.50. Such a move will suggest the bears have overpowered the bulls.Internet Computer (ICP) is struggling to rebound off the $103.71 support for the past two days, which indicates a lack of buyers even at these levels. This increases the likelihood of a break below the support.If that happens, the ICP/USDT pair could drop to the all-time low at $86.01. This is an important support to watch out for because if this level cracks, the pair could extend its decline to $60.The negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $120. That will indicate strong buying at lower levels. A break above $136.60 could open the door for a rally to $168.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading between the downtrend line and the support at $616.04. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($747) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest bears have the upper hand.If the price dips below the $616.04 support, the bears will try to pull the price down to the May 23 support at $468.13. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the decline could extend to $400.Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buyers are attempting to make a comeback. The BCH/USDT pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($930).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-07,"  The latest rally in BTC shorts is similar to what appeared ahead of the Elon Musk-led May 19 market crash. Bitcoin (BTC) bulls should brace for a potential onslaught from bears as the number of margined short positions on Bitfinex jumps by a little over 378%.Known to most by the ticker BTCUSD Shorts, the dataset records the number of bearish positions in the Bitcoin market. In simple terms, traders borrow funds from Bitfinex — their broker — to trade bet on bearish outcomes for the instrument BTC/USD. Meanwhile, the value of opened short positions is measured in BTC.The number of short margined positions on Bitfinex reached an intraday high of 6,468.2202 BTC this Monday, up more than 378% from its previous session’s low at 1,351.72 BTC. The spike prompted some analysts to alarm about a potential price crash in the Bitcoin spot market primarily because a similar wild BTCUSD Shorts uptrend at the beginning of last month had led the BTC/USD exchange rate down by almost $13,000 on May 19.For instance, independent market researcher Fomocap tweeted a chart that showed a visible correlation between Bitcoin spot rates and its margined short positions. The analyst highlighted two instances to note that two metrics moved inversely with some lag. His first example showed that on May 25, BTCUSD Shorts dropped lower, which was later led to a price rally in Bitcoin spot markets.The second example showed Bitcoin spot prices crashing after a spike in BTCUSD Shorts.EBlockChain, a TradingView contributor, said earlier on Monday that BTCUSD Shorts exceeding 200% and above is a “strong indication” of an imminent dump in Bitcoin spot markets. The analyst added:The boldly bearish statements for Bitcoin also came as its margin-longed positions rose steadily.BTCUSD Longs, another Bitfinex dataset that records the number of bullish margin positions, surged to as high as 44,538.6579 BTC on Monday. So, it appears, Bitcoin’s long exposure remained higher than short exposure in totality, illustrating that, to traders, the direction of the least risk was to the upside.But a sudden drop in Bitcoin spot prices could also lead leveraged long holders to dump their BTCUSD positions, which, in turn, incites further selling. Such an event is called “long squeeze.” May 19’s price crash, for example, had liquidated about $7.5 billion of long-leveraged positions across the cryptocurrency derivatives market.Jacob Canfield, a crypto trader, provided an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin following the May crash. Last week, the analyst stated that Bitcoin has already dropped by more than 40% following its May long squeeze — and now there is a lesser probability of facing another significant bearish move.After a long squeeze and liquidity is taken to the downside. Liquidity is usually engineered to the upside and shorts get trapped thinking more downside is coming. We already got 40% drop. Now it’s bears turn to get rekt again.Meanwhile, the cost to fund long positions in the Bitcoin derivatives market remained mostly below zero following the May 19 crash. Negative funding rates cause bearish traders to pay fees every eight hours. The situation encourages market makers and arbitrage desks to buy inverse swaps — or perpetual contracts — as they simultaneously unload their futures monthly contracts.Analysts typically interpret negative funding rates as a buy indicator because they create incentives for buyers and squeeze short-sellers. Meanwhile, the funding rates become neutral as soon as shorts close their positions.Bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation move has many traders point out the possible formation of a bearish pennant structure.Not a big fan of this structure. $BTC pic.twitter.com/yO8bG66ZzrIn retrospect, bearish pennants are downside continuation indicators — i.e., their setup typically involves the asset breaking out of the range and continuing in the direction of its previous trend. For example, Bitcoin dropped from around $65,000 to $30,000 before forming the pennant. Therefore, its likelihood of continuing lower appears higher based on technical structures alone.Meanwhile, one bullish backstop for Bitcoin remains fears of higher inflation. This week, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics will release May’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The data will set the future tone for the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policies, including near-zero lending rates and infinite bond-buying programs.Economists forecast that the CPI will rise to 4.7% for May compared to 4.2% in April.More evidence dropped in about investors’ intention to hold Bitcoin than to trade/liquidate it for other assets. For example, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported a decline in net exchange flows involving Bitcoin. Meanwhile, its rival CryptoQuant highlighted a significant drop in volume across the Bitcoin blockchain, hinting at a similar holding outlook via its “BTC: Active Address Count” metric.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-06,"  Bitcoin is on the verge of a trend defining move and if bulls succeed, ETH, ADA, SOL and THETA could rally higher. When the sentiment in the market turns bearish, every bit of negative news, however insignificant, pulls the price down as traders panic sell. This is what happened after China’s social media giant, Weibo, suspended a number of crypto-related accounts and triggered fears that a wider crackdown could occur.In other news, a note from Goldman Sachs said their meetings with 25 chief investment officers of long-only and hedge funds revealed Bitcoin (BTC) as the least favorite asset for investment.While the news may be negative in the short term, it is unlikely to change the long-term story of Bitcoin. As the price corrects, several institutional investors are likely to consider crypto investments to hedge their portfolio against the possible surge in inflation in the United States.From the perspective of most traders, Bitcoin's current decline continues to represent a buying opportunity for the longer term.  Let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.Bitcoin turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average ($39,127) on June 3 but is finding support near the trendline of the triangle. This shows that bulls are buying on dips, and bears are selling on rallies.The next trending move is likely to start after the price escapes from the triangle. If the bulls propel and sustain the price above the resistance line, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($47,198) and then to the pattern target at $52,622.90.On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the trendline of the triangle, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could result in a drop to the $30,000 to $28,000 support zone. If this zone cracks, the selling could intensify as several traders who bought recently may exit their positions. That may pull the price down to $20,000.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is oscillating roughly between 40 and 60, indicating an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. However, this state of uncertainty is unlikely to continue for long and the price is likely to break above or below the triangle in the next few days. If the price breaks out and sustains above the triangle, it will suggest the setup acted as a reversal pattern. Conversely, if the price breaks below the triangle, it will suggest that the current consolidation was a temporary halt in a strong downtrend. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, hence traders may wait for the break to happen before considering fresh positions.Ether (ETH) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($2.908) on June 4 and re-entered the symmetrical triangle. However, the positive thing is that bulls did not give up much ground, indicating strong buying near $2,550.If the buyers drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair may again challenge the 50-day SMA. A breakout and close above this resistance could clear the path for a move to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA once again, it will suggest that bears are defending the resistance aggressively. A break below $2,550 could pull the price down to the support line of the triangle. A break below the triangle will be the first indication that the bears are back in the driver’s seat.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $2,906. If that happens, the pair could rally to $3,600 and then to the pattern target at $4,083.26.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the trendline of the triangle. The bears will then try to pull the price down to $2,200 and then to the critical support at $1,728.74.Cardano (ADA) has been stuck in a large range between $1.94 and $1 for the past few days. The altcoin turned down from the resistance on the range on June 4 and has dropped to the moving averages. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the zone between the 20-day EMA ($1.66) and the 50-day SMA ($1.55). If the price rebounds off the current levels, it will suggest the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying the dips to the moving averages.A breakout and close above $1.94 will indicate the bulls are back in the driver’s seat. If the price sustains above this level, the ADA/USDT pair could retest the all-time high at $2.47. A break above this resistance will indicate the start of the next leg of the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA. The bears will then try to pull the price down to the $1.33 to $1.22 support zone. The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $1.94. This bullish setup has a target objective at $2.88. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash to the target because the bears may mount a stiff resistance at the current all-time high at $2.47.The 20-EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a possible drop to the trendline of the triangle. A break below this support will invalidate the bullish setup and that may result in a drop to $1.36 and then to $1.The bears are attempting to stall Solana’s (SOL) relief rally at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $43.38. However, the sellers haven’t been able to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($36.39), which indicates the sentiment has turned positive.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for SOL on June 1, before the rally picked up momentum..The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen from the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for SOL flipped green on June 1 when the price was close to $32.10.The VORTECS™ Score has consistently remained in the green since then and the price of SOL has rallied to $43.33 today, recording a 35% gain in five days. This shows how the VORTECS™ Score gave an early indication of a counter trend rally even as other tools would have been bearish.The SOL/USDT pair rebounded off the 20-day EMA on June 4 and has bounced off the 50-day SMA ($39.42) today. This suggests the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.If buyers drive the price above $43.38, it will indicate the downtrend is over. The pair could then rally to the 78.6% retracement level at $49.97 and then to the all-time high at $58.38. The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting the buyers have the upper hand.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and slumps below the trendline. The pair could then decline to $25.58 and later to $21.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have turned up and the RSI is trading in the positive territory, suggesting the bulls are making a comeback. The up-move may pick up momentum if buyers thrust the price above $43.38.Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks the 20-EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. The pair could then drop to the 50-SMA and then to the trendline. A break below the trendline will indicate that bears are back in the game. THETA is trading inside a descending channel. The bulls attempted to push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the channel on June 4 and 5 but failed. This suggests the bears are defending this resistance aggressively. However, the 20-day EMA ($8.19) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating the bulls have a slight advantage. If the THETA/USDT pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the buyers will make one more attempt to propel the price above the channel.If they succeed, it will suggest the downtrend could be over. The pair could then start an up-move to $13 and later to the all-time high at $15.88. This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could result in a decline to $6.The 4-hour chart shows the pair has turned down from the resistance line of the channel on two occasions. However, the bears have not been able to sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA, indicating demand at lower levels.If the pair rebounds off the current level, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the channel. If they manage to do that, the next leg of the uptrend may begin.On the other hand, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, the pair could slide down to the 50-SMA. A break below this support will suggest the start of a deeper correction.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-05,"  A push to $40,000-$42,000 won't protect Bitcoin from risks of undergoing a major price decline later, suggests a century-old price prediction model created by technical analyst titan Richard Wyckoff. Overconfident Bitcoin (BTC) bulls would need to battle more than just Elon Musk as a price prediction model — created by technical analyst pioneer Richard Wyckoff more than 100 years ago — also goes against their wild upside predictions.Dubbed as Wyckoff Method, the model involves a five-phase approach to determine price trends that majorly involve investors' psychological reaction to an asset's supply and demand. For example, in the case of accumulation, when an asset tends to bottom out following sharp price moves downhill, the five phases in order include Selling Climax (SC), Successful Secondary Test (ST), Last Point of Support (LPS), Sign of Strength (SOS), and ""stepping stones"" — that signifies more demand for the asset.On the other hand, the Distribution case appears like a 180-degree version of the Accumulation case, consisting of five phases that follow a strong price trend upward.The Preliminary Supply (PSY) signals a strong demand shift upward as price trends higher while accompanying increasing volumes. However, the uptrend ultimately exhausts, leading to an even called buying climax (BC). It follows a sell-off caused by a lack of demand near the asset's price stop against abundant supply. Wyckoff called the correction as Automatic Reaction (AR).Together, PSY, BC, and AR make Phase A.Meanwhile, Phase B involves a fake rebound towards BC, called Secondary Test (SET), followed by another drop that shows the asset's Sign of Weakness (SOW). Phase B also typically sees weak rebound attempts from SOW towards Upthrust (UT). Later, the transition to Phase C witnesses a terminal shakeout in distribution, known as Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD).Phase D involves an alarming lapse of demand against supply, also known as the Last Point of Supply (LPSY), leading to an all-and-all price crash in Phase E.Tempting Beef, an independent market analyst, alerted his followers that Bitcoin has entered the Accumulation cycle of the classic Wyckoff model. The pseudonymous entity flashed recent rebounds in the Bitcoin market, apprehensibly pointing at BTC/USD's potential to sustain a bullish trend above $40,000 on weakening supply and rising demand.But Tempting Beef presented a conflicting scenario by reimagining Phase A per Wyckoff Distribution schematics. The analyst marked the Bitcoin rebound from $30,000-low as a sign of PSY, leading up to BC, AR, ST, SOW, and other successive events mentioned across the Distribution phases.Bitcoin again landed itself in Phase C, which alarmed about demand exhaustion in the case of Wyckoff Distribution Events. It would mean that the cryptocurrency's point of least risk is to the downside — a price crash. Bitcoin's latest correction in the spot market surfaced following a yearlong rally. Between March 2020 and April 2021, the BTC/USD exchange rate ballooned by as much as 1,582%, logging an all-time high near $65,000.However, the pair wiped more than 50% of its price rally. The prices crashed, recovered, and they now consolidate sideways without hinting at a specific short-term bias for direction. Therefore, it now appears more like a Wyckoff Distribution model, since the phases follow a yearlong move upward, not downward.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle structure following its sharp downside correction after mid-May, hinting that the pattern is — in fact — a bearish pennant. Technically, bearish pennants send the prices lower by as much as the scale of the previous move lower.BTC/USD is trading at around $36,000, or 44.59% below its $65,000-top as of this time of writing."
2021-06-04,"  Data shows traders are buying $400 protective puts while also holding $7,000 call options, a signal that traders either have mixed emotions or are just cashing in on the upfront premium. After reviewing Ether (ETH) options for June 25, one might think that traders either became overly optimistic or ultra-bearish. Currently, there are large bets for prices below $1,000 while others aim for $3,800 and higher.A recent report from Coinshares shows that multiple crypto funds have begun seeing net inflows after weeks of record outflows. The report notes that Ether vehicles saw a total of $47 million in inflows, bringing its market dominance up to 27%.Another positive factor is that DeFi protocols maintain a $48 billion total value locked (TVL) even though the sector took a substantial hit after the recent Ether price crash.The 57% increase over the past three months should please even the most optimistic investors, but crypto traders notoriously exaggerate whatever situation took place over the most recent weeks. Therefore, as Ether dropped from the $4,380 all-time high on May 12, traders quickly scrambled to set up protective puts down to $400.On the other hand, the much-anticipated transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model could be the root of the positive expectations. The EIP-1559 improvement proposal set for next month is another significant stepping stone, and some traders have price targets ranging from $4,000 to $10,000.There are currently 623,800 Ether option contracts expiring on June 25, totaling a $1.75 billion open interest. The neutral-to-bullish call (buy) options are currently 29% more represented, although this call-to-put ratio uses an equal weight for every strike regardless of its probabilities.The ultra-bearish put (sell) options at $1,600 and lower amount to 170,000 Ether contracts, amounting to a $476 million open interest. However, considering the roughly three weeks left until the June 25 expiry, those contracts are trading below $32 each. The market value for those bearish options stands at $1.2 million.On the other hand, bulls likely have exaggerated by buying call options at $3,800 and higher. These 160,000 Ether contracts amount to a $450 million open interest but considering that their current face value is below $80 each, their market value stands at $5 million.Therefore, bulls spent more money setting up their position despite the similar open interest placed on both sides. These out-of-the-money options are an excellent way for options sellers to cash in the premium in advance. The same methodology can be applied for $2,100 put options and $3,800 call options.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-04,"  Continued selling at overhead resistance levels suggests that Bitcoin and altcoins could remain range-bound in the short term. Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone believes Bitcoin (BTC) is more likely to turn up and rally to $100,000 rather than correct to $20,000. In the June edition of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index report, McGlone said that Bitcoin’s correction had not dented its foundation and it was ""stronger, greener and less extended"" than in April.While Bitcoin has yet to witness a surge in demand, data from Coinshares show crypto funds have turned the corner and after two weeks of outflows, investors have pumped $74 million into cryptocurrency. Ether (ETH) products were leading the inflows with $47 million being pumped into them. Altcoins such as Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT) each experienced more than $3 million in inflows.Novice traders seem to be in a hurry for the next leg of the bull move to begin. However, that is unlikely to happen quickly because after the recent market reset, the transfer of assets from weaker hands to stronger hands will take time. The reactions to Elon Musk’s tweets show some froth still remains. The crypto market may remain volatile as long-term investors are accumulating on lower levels but stopping their purchases at higher levels. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies and determine the critical support and resistance levels to watch out for.Bitcoin rose above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 3 but the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($39,856). This suggests the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on relief rallies.The bears have pulled the price back into the triangle and they will now try to sink the price below the support line of the triangle. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the critical support zone at $30,000 to $28,000.If this zone cracks, panic selling may set in and that could result in a drop to the next major support at $20,000. Such a deep fall could delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the 20-day EMA. That will suggest the sentiment has improved and bulls are buying at higher levels. The rally could then extend to the 50-day simple moving average ($48,192).Ether broke above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 3 but the bulls could not push the price above the 50-day SMA ($2,895). This may have attracted selling from short-term traders and the price dipped back into the triangle today.The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a few days of consolidation. The pair could remain stuck inside the triangle for a few more days.A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will signal the start of an up-move that could reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72. Conversely, a break below the triangle may result in a retest of the critical support at $1,728.74.Binance Coin’s (BNB) relief rally hit a wall near the overhead resistance at $423.83 on June 3. This suggests the bears are defending this level and the bulls will have to push the price above it to gain the upper hand.If the BNB/USDT pair rebounds off the trendline, it will suggest the formation of an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $433. This bullish setup has a target objective at $586.The flattening 20-day EMA ($400) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action. This view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the trendline. That could open the doors for a drop to $211.70.Cardano turned down from just under the $1.94 resistance today, suggesting the bears are defending this level aggressively. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls are buying on dips to the moving averages.The buyers will now make one more attempt to drive the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and challenge the all-time high at $2.47. Alternatively, if bears sink the price below the trendline, the ADA/USDT pair could slide to $1.59 and then to $1. A strong rebound off this support will suggest the pair could trade inside the large range between $1 and $1.94 for a few days.The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a few days of consolidation.Dogecoin (DOGE) turned down from $0.44 on June 2, suggesting that traders are closing their positions on rallies. The bears have pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.37) today, indicating weakness.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the DOGE/USDT pair continues its slide and breaks below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, the selling could intensify. The bulls may try to arrest the decline at $0.21 but if they fail to do so, the pair may drop to $0.10.This negative view will nullify if the price bounces off the neckline and rises above $0.47. Such a move will indicate the bulls are back in the driver’s seat and the pair could then rally to $0.59. XRP’s failure to rally above the 20-day EMA ($1.06) suggests the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. If the bears sink the price below the trendline, the decline could extend to $0.79 and then to $0.65.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 suggest the bears have the upper hand. A break below $0.65 could clear the path for a drop to $0.56 and then to $0.45.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the trendline, it will signal strength. If the bulls push and sustain the price above $1.10, the XRP/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.27) and then to the downtrend line.Although Polkadot rose above $26.50 on June 3, the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggested selling by traders at higher levels. The altcoin has turned down today and broken below the $26.50 level.The bears will now try to pull the price down to the trendline. If this support holds, the DOT/USDT pair could again rally to $26.50. If the bulls sustain the price above this resistance, the pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($32.64).Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, the pair could drop to the $15 support. If the price rebounds off this support, the pair could remain range-bound between $15 and $26.50 for a few days.The flat 20-day EMA ($26.45) and the RSI below 46 also point to a few days of consolidation.Uniswap (UNI) has again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($28.14) today, indicating the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. The sellers will now try to pull the price down to the support at $21.50.The bulls are likely to defend $21.50 aggressively as they had done on May 30. A strong rebound off this support will confirm the formation of a higher low. The UNI/USDT pair could then remain range-bound between $21.50 and $30 for a few days.This neutral view will be negated if the bears sink the price below $21.50. That will suggest the sellers have overpowered the buyers, resulting in a drop to $16 and then to $13.04. On the contrary, a break above $30 could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($33.27) and then to the 78.6% retracement level at $38.15.After trading in a tight range between $103.71 and $120 for a few days, Internet Computer (ICP) broke above the overhead resistance on June 3. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears used this rally to sell and trap the aggressive bulls.The ICP/USDT pair turned down sharply today and the bears are now trying to pull the price below the $103.71 support. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the all-time low at $86.01. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the pair could decline to $60.However, if the bulls defend the $103.71 support, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The buyers will have to sustain the price above $120 to signal the possibility of a consolidation between $103.71 and $168.The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the downtrend line today, indicating the bears are defending this level aggressively. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($780) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the bears are in control.If bears sink the price below $616.04, the altcoin could drop to $468.13. This level may act as a strong support. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the price above the downtrend line.If they succeed, the BCH/USDT pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $919.60. A break above this resistance could open the doors for a rally to the 50% retracement at $1,059.07.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-04,"  A decade to hyperbitcoinization is ""most likely,"" says Kraken executive Dan Held, a forecast echoed by Unchained Capital's Parker Lewis. Bitcoin (BTC) may be just 10 years away from seeing mass adoption in an event known as ""hyperbitcoinization.""That's according to participants of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, who on June 4 delivered surprisingly optimistic verdicts on when hyperbitcoinization will come.Speaking on a panel, The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous, Unchained Capital head of business development Parker Lewis and Kraken growth lead Dan Held all gave their deadlines for when Bitcoin will effectively take over global finance.""I'd say a decade,"" Lewis began.That would involve the Bitcoin network onboarding billions of new users by 2031, but as the panel noted, the rate of adoption since 2011 has already produced hundreds of millions of Bitcoiners.""I'm going to be a little more conservative than Parker and say maybe 15 years to 16 years — you know, four more halving cycles,"" Ammous continued.His perspective is similar to that of PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models, who previously estimated that after several halving cycles, it will become impossible to measure Bitcoin's price in dollars. This is because as a currency with no bottom, the potential for Bitcoin to grow in U.S. dollar terms is infinite.""I would say at least a decade for hyperbitcoinization would be the most likely and actually conservative estimate,"" Held concluded.As Cointelegraph reported, the stock-to-flow model predicts an average BTC/USD price of either $100,000 or $288,000 this halving cycle, depending on which type of model is used.So far, PlanB has remained unfazed by the recent rout that took over 50% of Bitcoin's value off its latest all-time highs of $64,500."
2021-06-04,"  Exciting action for the historically accurate metric lays the foundation for a new cycle to a price peak. Bitcoin (BTC) losing over 50% in a month may have a big silver lining as lower prices set up a classic bull flag.On Thursday, Philip Swift, creator of the Pi Cycle Top indicator, said that this year could still see a major Bitcoin price high. Pi Cycle Top uses two moving averages — the 111-day and the 350-day multiplied by 2 — to determine likely market tops with an error range of just three days. It has proven extremely accurate, and current conditions are setting up a crossover from the two averages which suggests a return to bullishness.“The 111dma (orange line) continues to rapidly drop below the 350dma x 2 (green line),” Swift commented on Twitter. This provides a firm counterpoint to short-term price action amid fears that a so-called “death cross” of two other moving averages may cause pain in the coming weeks. Last week, analyst Filbfilb, who together with Swift heads trading suite DecenTrader, laid out the potential for significant moves up or down for BTC/USD.“Price action is some way from the 20 Week Moving Average (WMA) which is typically the line between Bitcoin being either in a bull or bear market and as such remains a bearish scenario for Bitcoin,” he wrote.As Cointelegraph reported, however, a consensus is building that a local bottom has formed at $36,000 for BTC/USD. This was predicted even before the latest drama involving Elon Musk."
2021-06-04,"  Elon Musk continues playing with the crypto Twitter, causing more rage in the community. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has brought more stress to the cryptocurrency markets by posting another series of cryptocurrency-related tweets on Thursday.Bitcoin lost around $2,000 in a matter of hours after Musk took to Twitter to post about Bitcoin (BTC) again.The Bitcoin price reacted immediately, dropping from around $38,700 to $37,500 in an hour. Bitcoin continued falling as Musk kept tweeting more cryptic posts in the thread including another breakup-themed tweet on falling crypto prices as well as a post on Dogecoin (DOGE).pic.twitter.com/MLhu6oOwgcBitcoin subsequently dipped to as low as $36,400, dropping over 6% over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $36,322, according to data from CoinMarketCap.The price action comes shortly after Bitcoin attempted to retest $40,000 yesterday, with some traders suggesting that BTC could face a correction before continuing an upward trend.Musk’s new Bitcoin tweets spurred another wave of outrage in the crypto community. Some questioned the credibility of Musk’s tweets regarding Bitcoin.For anyone thinking @elonmusk 's tweets have any credibility and you sold your #BitcoinHe just tweeted ""CUM"" ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/Z4x4yUeBw7Musk has been widely criticized in the community since he announced the suspension of Tesla's BTC payment option amid environmental concerns about Bitcoin mining, causing BTC to drop nearly $30,000 in mid-May.Musk has emerged as a major Bitcoin price influencer on Twitter, previously causing major optimism on the market by announcing a $1.5 billion worth Bitcoin purchase in February. Following BTC payment suspension at Tesla, Musk hinted that the company could dump its Bitcoin holdings from its balance sheet.Musk’s latest tweets come right before the Miami Bitcoin 2021 event that is set to kick off this morning, touted as the “largest Bitcoin event in history.”"
2021-06-03,"  Ether price has outperformed Bitcoin by 32% since May, but derivatives data shows pro traders are feeling less bullish about the top altcoin. Ether (ETH) has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 32% since May, and even though there has been a steady flow of bullish reports from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, derivatives metrics show elements of bearishness in both assets. Bitcoin is trading 41% below its $64,900 all-time high, and that move has driven the ""Crypto Fear and Greed Index"" to its lowest level since March 2020. While retail traders fear the dip, global investment firm Guggenheim Investments has filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for a new fund that may seek exposure to Bitcoin.Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin when he said:Ethereum overtook Bitcoin in terms of miner revenue and network value transacted right as a report from Goldman Sachs revealed that the global investment bank believes Ether has a ""high chance of overtaking Bitcoin as a dominant store of value."" The report noted the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and the nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystems being built on Ethereum.Notice how Ethereum miners' revenue significantly outpaced revenue for Bitcoin miners in May, reaching a $76 million daily average. This figure leapfrogged Bitcoin's $45 million in miners' revenue, including the 6.25 BTC subsidy per block, plus transaction fees.A similar situation happened with the amount transacted and transferred on each network. For the first time, Ethereum presented a significant advantage, according to this metric.The chart above shows the Ethereum network settling $25 billion per day on average, which is 85% higher than Bitcoin. Stablecoins certainly played an important role, but so did the $50 billion net value locked in decentralized finance applications.When measuring the futures contract premium, both Bitcoin and Ether display similar levels of bearishness. The basis rate measures the difference between longer-term futures contracts and the current spot market levels.The one-month futures contract usually trades with 10%–20% premium versus regular spot exchanges to justify locking the funds instead of immediately cashing out.As depicted above, the futures premium has been below 10% since the May 19 crash for both Bitcoin and Ether. This indicates a slight bearishness, although far from a negative indicator, known as backwardation.To assess Ether traders' optimism, one should look at the 25% delta skew. The metric will turn positive when the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. This situation is usually considered a ""fear"" scenario. On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of upside protection and points toward bullishness.Similar to the futures premium, Ether options' 25% delta skew has been ranging above 10% since May 19. This indicates that market makers and whales are unwilling to offer downside protection, indicating ""fear.""Albeit distant from a highly adverse situation, both Ether derivatives indicators point to a complete lack of bullishness, despite the altcoin's 270% gain year-to-date. In the face of this disappointing data, some analysts will find the ""glass half full,"" as it leaves room for a positive surprise. Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, or EIP-1559, which is expected for July, will create a base network fee that would fluctuate based on network demand. The update also proposes to burn transaction fees, thereby introducing deflation to the Ethereum ecosystem. OKEx analyst Rick Delaney stated that it ""may enhance the asset's appeal among the planet's wealthiest investors.""The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
2021-06-03,"  “Bitcoin $20,000 or $100,000 in 2021? Crypto Trend Is Upward,” wrote Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone.    Despite a massive drawdown in May, the Bitcoin (BTC) bull market appears to be intact, with a $100,000 price target more likely than a retrace to $20,000, according to Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist. The June edition of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index report described Bitcoin as ""stronger, greener and less extended"" than during the height of the rally in April. For that reason, the flagship digital currency is more likely to reach the coveted six-figure mark this year than incur a deeper correction back down to 2017 highs. McGlone cited an overextended rally, Chinese restrictions and unwarranted focus on Bitcoin’s energy use as the primary catalysts for the May correction, which included a more than 50% drawdown peak-to-trough. “Bitcoin’s 2021 Foundation Is Firm,” McGlone wrote, adding:He continued:Still, analysts are divided about BTC’s trajectory in the short to intermediate timeframes. Several theorists are forecasting a retest of its 2017 high, with at least one classic indicator predicting a bottom of around $16,000. Others, such as on-chain analyst Willy Woo, have said the bottom is likely in thanks to improving network fundamentals and higher adoption rates.Veteran trader Peter Brandt has speculated that the worst of the BTC price correction may not be over, but he told his Twitter followers that it’s not wise to bail if they’re holding spot positions:Big picture perspective on owning $BTC in appropriate size with money you can afford to loseMarket topped $64,7kfMarket corrected to $30,0kWorst I can envision is $21,0kWhy would someone bail out of non-leveraged longs when the market already had 80% of worst case drop?Cycle theorist Bob Loukas believes there’s a good chance that BTC's price bottomed last month, but he did warn of an intermediate downtrend over the next 60 days. “Intermediate trend is now down,” Loukas tweeted on May 27. “But secular bull trend providing counter balance.” Nevertheless, he acknowledged the potential for downside risk exposing the $20,000 handle, noting the difficulty of trading without a clear trend in place.Still looking at chopping 60day cycle #bitcoin. Difficult to trade for most. Everyone with off the map price predictions confirms.  Mostly observing personally for now (trades).There is downside risk to $20k (trend is down) so a have plan just in case.https://t.co/13vdALGfSX"
2021-06-03,"  Another price dip is required before continuation, one trader says, giving a short-term target of $36,000 for BTC/USD. Bitcoin (BTC) edged closer to $40,000 on Thursday as bulls gathered increasing signals that the bottom is in.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD retaining levels it reclaimed a day before, including the critical $37,500.Now, eyes were on the coming days for confirmation of a breakout or rejection — volatility was already forecast to enter by the weekend.For popular trader Crypto Ed, the market might need another bearish test in the short term before coming back with a vengeance. In the meantime, it may be a case of grinning and bearing familiar moves.“I think we’re close to a reversal and a correction during the day before up again,” he told Twitter followers on Thursday. He added that he assumed that BTC/USD is going to correct rather than continue upward.Meanwhile, two new metrics that specifically try to catch Bitcoin price bottoms went live on monitoring resource Glassnode this week in a timely release for traders.Created by David Puell, well known for his famous Puell Multiple indicator, delta cap and balanced price both provided cues that Bitcoin may already be in recovery. “Watch out for confluence on these in the next bear,” Puell added. As Cointelegraph reported, opinions continue to focus on this year seeing a double top pattern on Bitcoin similar to 2013. In both previous bull markets, major retracements from local highs were standard on the way to ultimate peaks; and as such, there is nothing unusual about current behavior. That was the opinion of stock-to-flow creator PlanB this week in conversation with podcast host Preston Pysh."
2021-06-02,"  Investors like the looks of proof-of-stake coins, while Ethereum leads the way.  A new report from analytics firm Coinshares shows that while the market dip may not have ended, prices are now at levels where stock market investors are once again showing signs of interest in digital asset funds. A report published yesterday from Coinshares shows that multiple funds have begun seeing net inflows after weeks of record outflows in the wake of a crippling, market-wide crypto dip. In totally, legacy markets poured in $74 million into crypto investment vehicles, though not all products showed signs of strength. Cryptocurrencies show inflows after record outflows in previous two weeks. Ethereum investment product market share at record high 27%.https://t.co/xhzVCkBjM9 pic.twitter.com/Dw2WrdA2RsWhile some analysts are calling for Bitcoin as low as $16,000 per BTC, Bitcoin products were among the weakest performers, with $4 million in net outflows. The report notes that altcoins — particularly more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake altcoins — were strong performers, with Cardano, Ripple, and Polkadot funds each seeing above $3 million in inflows. The true star of the report is Ethereum, however. ETH vehicles saw a total of $47 million in inflows, making up the majority of net digital asset fund investments and bringing ETH vehicle market dominance up to 27%. The bullish outlook from investors on the asset comes after a string of bullish reports from academic and institutional finance research desks. Last week both the University of Pennsylvania and Goldman Sachs wrote research arguing for Ethereum as a store of value, in part due to its importance to the DeFi ecosystem. The world’s largest layer one smart contract platform also has a number of technical advancements and headwinds on the horizon. Layer two scaling solution Arbitrum recently went live with a guarded launch, and the long-awaited gas fee overhaul of EIP-1559 is set for later this year, as well as a likewise much-anticipated transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model. "
2021-06-02,"  Bitcoin bulls fell short of flipping the $38,000 level to support, and one analyst said on-chain data signals that BTC could see “a smaller drawdown.” The cryptocurrency faithful got a reprieve from recent market struggles thanks to a rally in decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens and Dogecoin (DOGE) on June 2. A bit of a breakout in the price of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) may have also lifted sentiment, but at the moment, the top-ranked digital assets are still meeting pushback at key overhead resistance levels. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin rallied 7.3% from a low of $35,645 on June 1 to an intraday high at $38,250 on June 2, and Ether saw a similar-sized gain of 7.7% to briefly regain the $2,800 support level.While the uptick in prices has many calling for a continuation of the 2021 bull market, some analysts have highlighted a possible bearish pennant formation on the Bitcoin chart, which could result in a price breakdown to as low as $16,000.Bitcoin’s volatile price action over the past month has led many to speculate on whether the top is in for BTC or the current correction is just a mid-cycle breather that will prepare the asset for continuation once the rally resumes. Deeper insight into the matter was provided in a recent Delphi Digital report that discussed the MVRV ratio, an on-chain metric that measures Bitcoin’s market value (MV) against its realized value (RV) as an indicator that can help traders determine market tops and bottoms. The chart above shows that the MVRV ratio became overextended in early 2011, late 2013 and early 2018, “all of which represented cycle tops,” as highlighted by Delphi Digital. The researchers also suggested that “May 2021’s reading could very well indicate the top for this cycle.”While it is possible that the top may be in for the current cycle, Delphi Digital also noted that there is the potential for the market to “see an outcome that resembles 2013’s 'double bubble' where BTC made an ATH [all-time high], price fell hard, and then recovered well past the ATH in the same year.”The report further highlighted the fact that the threshold for determining Bitcoin’s bottom has increased over time, which could change the landscape of bull markets in the years ahead. According to Delphi Digital:As a note of caution, the report did point out that while “There’s a lot of conflicting data and sentiment” in the market currently, there is likely to be “an episode of mean reversion in coming weeks as price deviated far from its 50 day moving average.”Altcoins notched double-digit gains during June 2’s price action, led by a 53% gain in the price of Kyber Network's KNC token, which is now back above $2.50. KAVA also secured a 37% rally and currently trades near $4.70. Dogecoin, Kusama's KSM token and Curve DAO's CRV token also helped lead the altcoin charge, with price rallies around 25%, while OKB put on a 33% gain and trades near $17.70. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.709 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 41.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-02,"  Bears' misplaced belief that Bitcoin's price would drop to $32,000 allowed Friday's BTC options expiry to become unexpectedly balanced.  On June 4, a total of 15,530 Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expire, which represents $575 million in open interest. At the moment, bulls are still heavily impacted by May's 37% BTC price correction, and this has led most call (buy) options to be underwater.Despite the crash, Bitcoin's active supply reached a five-month low, as 45% of the coins have not been moved over the past two years. This indicator shows that investors who purchased up until the 2019 bull run are unwilling to sell at the current prices.Miners are also avoiding sales below $40,000, as their outflows recently reached a seven-month low relative to the historical average.In the meantime, technical analysts pointed to the 50-week exponential moving average as a strong support level close to $34,000. Still, the price chart has been forming a pattern of sideways trading that is culminating in a narrowing wedge and breakout — known as ""compression"" — and indicating higher volatility toward the end of the week.What is clear is that the market is a mixed bag right now, and everyone is grasping at various signals as an attempt to pinpoint the direction of the next trending move. While bears could have easily dominated Friday's expiry, it seems they became overconfident by focusing primarily on sub-$32,000 put (sell) options.The initial picture favors bears, as the call-to-put ratio stands at 0.84, although this indicator values every option the same. However, the right to acquire Bitcoin at $46,000 in less than 42 hours is currently worthless, so this call option is trading below $20 each.A similar effect is in place for the neutral-to-bearish put options at $28,000 and lower. Holders have no benefit in rolling it over for the upcoming weeks, as these contracts also became worthless. Therefore, to better assess how traders are positioned for Friday's options expiry, one needs to concentrate on the $32,000–$42,000 range.The neutral-to-bull call options up to $42,000 amount to 3,080 Bitcoin contracts, representing $114 million in open interest. On the other hand, put (sell) options down to $32,000 encompass 4,680 Bitcoin contracts, currently worth $173 million.As expected, the $60 million difference favoring bears is not enough to cause any disturbance. This situation was caused by excessively bearish bets that did not pay off, potentially leading to the first balanced options expiry in three weeks.The 25% delta skew provides a reliable, instant ""fear and greed"" analysis. This indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side by side and will turn positive when the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. This situation is usually considered a ""fear"" scenario, although it's frequent after solid rallies.On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of upside protection and points toward bullishness.Since May 17, the indicator has flipped to the ""fear"" range on multiple occasions and peaked at 20%, signaling a lack of interest to offer protective puts.There is no doubt that bulls are frightened, but historically, those are the best opportunities to buy the dip. At least for the June 4 options expiry, bears no longer dominate the trade. Huobi, OKEx and Deribit expiries take place on June 4 at 8:00 am UTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-02,"  Altcoins are picking up steam as the relief rally in Bitcoin and Ether gains traction.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) active supply — coins that have moved in the past two years or earlier — dropped to a five-month low of 44.5% on June 2, according to data from Glassnode. This indicates that investors who had purchased Bitcoin more than two years ago are not keen to sell after the 40% drop.Even miners, who sold during the May correction have since reversed their decision. The outflows from miner addresses are at the lowest level in seven months, which suggests that miners are holding on to their Bitcoin. Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that Bitcoin’s correction could extend below $30,000. Brandt said that every 50% fall in Bitcoin’s history has stretched to 70%. He also highlighted that according to past precedence, Bitcoin is unlikely to hit a new all-time high within seven months of a 50% correction.However, PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow-based Bitcoin price models, believes a further sharp fall below $30,000 is unlikely. He also remains positive on the prospects of Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high this year.At the moment, analysts are divided in their opinion on Bitcoin’s short-term price action. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance.Bitcoin continues to trade inside a symmetrical triangle pattern as the bulls and the bears battle it out to establish their supremacy. Although the symmetrical triangle generally acts as a continuation pattern, it is difficult to predict with certainty until the price breaks out of the triangle.The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the negative territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. If the BTC/USDT pair breaks below the triangle, the bearish momentum could pick up. There is a minor support at $28,000 but if that also cracks, the pair could retest the $20,000 level.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the triangle. If that happens, it will suggest that bulls have overpowered the bears. The pair could then attempt a rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($49,201). This level may again act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls propel the price above it, the pair will signal that the downtrend could be over.Ether (ETH) turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,762) on June 1 but the positive sign is that the bulls did not give up much ground. This suggests that the buyers did not hurry to close their positions.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has risen near the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure has reduced.If buyers drive and sustain the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could start a relief rally that may reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72 and then the 78.6% retracement level at $3,806.91.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the triangle, the pair may consolidate inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakdown and close below the triangle will indicate advantage to the bears.Binance Coin (BNB) has risen above the 20-day EMA ($399) but it could face stiff resistance at $423.83. If the price turns down from this overhead resistance, the bulls will try to arrest the decline at the trendline. If they succeed, it will suggest the bulls are attempting to form a higher low. This will increase the possibility of a break above $423.83. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($505). A breakout of this resistance will suggest the downtrend may be over. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below the trendline, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The pair could then retest the critical support at $211.70.Cardano (ADA) broke above the downtrend line on June 1 and the bulls are trying to extend the relief rally above $2 today. The 20-day EMA ($1.64) has started to turn up and the RSI is trading above 54, suggesting that the bulls have the upper hand.If buyers succeed in pushing the price above $2, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to the all-time high at $2.47.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $2, the bears will try to pull the price back below the downtrend line. If that happens, it will suggest that buying dries up at higher levels. The pair could then drop to the 50-day SMA ($1.52).A breakdown and close below the 50-day SMA could attract further selling and the pair may drop to $1.33 and later to $1. Dogecoin (DOGE) broke above the downtrend line on May 31 and cleared the 20-day EMA ($0.37) hurdle today. The RSI has jumped into the positive territory and the 20-day EMA has started to turn up, suggesting the bulls are making a comeback.If buyers propel the price above $0.47, the DOGE/USDT pair could pick up further momentum and rise to $0.59. Conversely, if the price turns down from $0.47, the pair could correct to the 20-day EMA. If this support holds, it will suggest the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price above $0.47.However, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $0.28 and then to $0.21.The bulls tried to push XRP above the 20-day EMA ($1.07) on June 1 but met with stiff resistance from the bears. However, the buyers did not give up much ground, indicating strength.The bulls will again try to thrust and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair could start its relief rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.30) and then to the downtrend line.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair could again drop to the $0.88 to $0.80 support zone. A break below this zone could result in a retest of the May 23 low at $0.65.Polkadot (DOT) is inching towards the overhead resistance at $26.50. The price had turned down from this resistance on May 28, hence the bears are again likely to defend this level aggressively.If the DOT/USDT pair turns down from $26.50 but bounces off the trendline, it will suggest that bulls are accumulating on dips. That could result in the formation of a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $26.50. The pattern target of this setup is $35.91.Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, the pair could drop to the support at $15. A strong rebound off this support will suggest a few days of range-bound action between $15 and $26.50.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($28.41) on June 1 but the positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to drift down. The buyers are again trying to push the price above the 20-day EMA today.The repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has risen above 48, indicating the selling pressure has reduced.If buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA and $30, the UNI/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($33.67). A breakout of this resistance could signal an end of the downtrend.Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plunges below $25.94, the bears will attempt to pull the pair down to $21.50. A breakdown and close below this support will suggest that the bears have reasserted their supremacy.Internet Computer (ICP) remains weak as the bulls have not been able to push the price back above $120 in the past five days. This suggests a lack of aggressive buying even at the current levels.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the $103.71 support, the ICP/USDT pair could resume its downtrend and challenge the May 19 low at $86. If this support cracks, the pair may drop to $60.On the contrary, if bulls propel and sustain the price above $120, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. That may clear the path for an up-move to $168. If the price turns down from this resistance, a few days of range-bound action is likely. The pair could pick up bullish momentum on a breakout and close above $168.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose above $685.36 on May 31. The bears tried to pull the price back below the level on June 1 but they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests buyers are trying to form a higher low.The relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($801). If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the BCH/USDT pair below the $685 to $600 support zone. If they succeed, the pair could retest the May 23 low at $468.13. Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the momentum could pick up and the pair may rally to the 50-day SMA ($958). This level may again act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the rally may extend to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,198.53.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-06-02,"  Bitcoin is forming a textbook downside continuation structure called a bearish pennant whose ultimate breakout target lurks near $16,000. Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded by more than 25% after bottoming out at $30,000 during the May 19 crash. But the cryptocurrency continues to tread ahead under the possibility of facing another period of strong sell-offs owing to a classic technical indicator pattern.Dubbed a “bearish pennant,” the pattern forms when an asset consolidates after a strong move downward and forms a small symmetrical triangle-like price range. It breaks below the range support and continues moving lower. Traders usually estimate the size of the negative breakout move by measuring the height of the earlier move.Bitcoin is currently trading inside a similar bearish pennant structure, fluctuating sideways as it forms a sequence of lower highs and higher lows. Meanwhile, its consolidation structure precedes a massive move downhill to around $20,000. Therefore, if the BTC/USD exchange rate breaks below the pennant structure and is accompanied by rising trade volumes, its likelihood of crashing by almost $20,000 is high.The bearish outlook also borrows cues from Bitcoin's recent bounce. It is worthy to take notice that the cost to purchase 1 BTC fell from almost $65,000 to $30,000 on May 19 — or by over 50% — followed by a considerable 30% bounce.Meanwhile, market analytics service Income Machine is warning of a ""dead cat bounce"" scenario emerging in the Bitcoin market, noting that upcoming rallies in BTC/USD could face limitations by further selling pressure near the May 26 highs (the $39,000–$41,000 area). It recommended traders exit their bullish positions near $40,000.What's more, Income Machine also noted that a failure to hold $30,000 as support would risk crashing Bitcoin prices to $16,200 — a level that coincides with the bearish pennant target. The analytics firm selected $16,200 because of its historical relevance as support during the November–December 2020 session.""Conversely, an upside break of the May 26 highs would cause us to reverse our analysis and adopt a more bullish outlook for BTC-USD,"" added Income Machine analysts.Pankaj Balani, chief executive and co-founder of crypto derivatives exchange Delta, also anticipated an extended bearish breakdown should Bitcoin’s price close below $34,000. Nevertheless, the former UBS official limited his downside target to $28,000, 2021's lowest level. He told Cointelegraph:Balani also noted that the current price action signifies demand in the $30,000–$35,000 range. Therefore, an upward swing from the said area could end up breaking the bearish pennant — which Balani referred to as a symmetrical triangle — to the upside.""BTC is forming a classic symmetric triangle and any breakout/breakdown will lead to a significant price move,"" he said, adding:"
2021-06-02,"  All eyes are on whether Bitcoin can flip $37,500 to support for a continuation of bullish momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) hit $38,000 on June 2 as a long-awaited bout of volatility saw a critical bull level return.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD finally beating resistance at $37,500 on June 2, going on to hit local highs of $38,090.Questions were even being asked as to whether $30,000 would stay as support, with a potential further price dip set to take BTC to $20,000 — or worse.With the latest gains, however, the mood noticeably lifted.""Important update: past week I showed the bearish pennant and what are the possible scenarios... We just made a new high, meaning BTC is doing 5 legs up in this current move and opening the gates for more upside,"" popular trader Crypto Ed tweeted in his latest update. Crypto Ed was one of a number of traders calling for a bullish continuation for Bitcoin rather than a breakdown should $37,500 resistance be firmly quashed.That level represents a ""line in the sand"" for bulls, Cointelegraph reported, and flipping it to support would open up the path to higher crux levels at $40,000 and $42,000.Fellow trader Rekt Capital was cautious, arguing that the recovery needed ""sustained"" bullish activity to avoid defeat.He highlighted a so-called ""death cross"" pattern looming on the weekly chart, which signals downside in the form of two moving averages — the 50-week and the 200-week — crossing over one another.""A BTC Death Cross may or may not happen in the coming weeks. But that doesn't mean BTC can't rebound from current levels before then,"" he told Twitter followers. The move was significant for hodlers, who had watched as momentum failed to take Bitcoin higher than the lower end of its broad trading range with $30,000 as support.At the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at around $37,800, up 3.5% in the past 24 hours."
2021-06-02,"  Regulators don't want to stifle the growth of crypto industry, CoinShares' Meltem Demirors said. The $2.6 trillion market cap peak compelled regulators worldwide to take a serious look at cryptocurrencies, but they also don’t want to stifle a growing industry, CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors said.Stating that “uncertainty is the name of the game for the industry,” Meltem Demirors noted that it took over the macro environment for the last few weeks. “Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, has indicated he wants to get more serious about regulating crypto exchanges,” she added, “Across the world, we are seeing regulators starting to take note.”Cryptocurrencies started this year with under $1 trillion total market cap, peaking at $2.6 trillion a few weeks ago. Demirors said regulators are starting to take the asset class seriously. ""We will continue to see uncertainty why the industry, investors, and speculators alike wait to see how regulation shapes up,"" she added.Speaking on regulators’ perception of the market, Demirors said that regulators want to ensure Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering compliance and ensure market oversight without stifling the growing crypto industry.Demirors stressed the central bankers’ warnings on crypto have an impact on sentiment. “Sentiment informs demand, and demand informs what takes place in the market,” she explained. The exec described what we’ve seen over the last weeks as the biggest deleveraging event. Following the May 19 sell-off, which saw the largest daily wick in Bitcoin (BTC) history, nearly 60% of total leverages have been unwound from the crypto derivatives market, she noted.Commenting on the price actions of crypto, Demirors doesn’t believe the crypto prices will stay flat for too long, stating, “There’s over $3 trillion of dry powder on the sidelines in the US institutions alone. It is going to get deployed, and I can’t help but believe some of that will find its way into this market.”"
2021-06-02,"  Institutional investors continue to exit BTC in favor of ETH, with Ether investment products now representing more than one-quarter of institutional crypto AUM. Institutional demand for Ethereum continues to surge, with Ether products now representing more than one quarter of the assets under management (AUM) of crypto investment products.According to CoinShares’ June 1 Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report, the past week saw significant institutional inflows of $74 million as investors sought to capitalize on the fall out from the recent crash in which many crypto assets lost more than 50% of their value.More than 63% of institutional inflows were injected into Ether products, or $46.8 million of the total. Ether products now represent 27% of the combined AUM for crypto investment products — the highest share yet.Significant inflows were also made to products offering exposure to multiple crypto assets ($11.1 million) as well as funds targeting Cardano ($5.2 million), XRP ($4.5 million), and Polkadot ($3.8 million).Outflows from Bitcoin products have slowed, with roughly $4 million in capital exiting the markets — down from last week’s $110.9 million in outflows. Over the past three weeks, $246 million has exited BTC investment products.Despite Bitcoin’s 30-day inflows of $47.9 million currently equating to roughly one-third of Ether’s $147.7 million, Bitcoin still dominates year-to-date inflows with nearly $4.4 billion compared to Ether’s $973 million.However, Ether’s recent momentum has given rise to renewed speculation as to whether Ethereum is gearing up to flip Bitcoin, with Ethereum currently beating out crypto’s honeybadger by transaction count, volume, and fees, and trade volume.According to CoinGecko, Ether is currently the second-most traded crypto asset with $38.8 billion in daily volume, ranking behind only Tether’s $103 billion. Roughly $32.9 worth of BTC changed hands over the past 24 hours."
2021-06-01,"  Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction fees have declined down to $7.20 and 4.80, respectively. The transaction fees of Bitcoin and Ethereum have slumped to six-month lows as the markets cool after the recent crypto downturn.According to BitInfoCharts, the average price of performing a transaction using Bitcoin has fallen from an early-April all-time high of $62.77 to around $7.20 — an 88% drop over just six weeks. The falling Bitcoin transaction fees appear to have been driven by a decline in overall market activity, with daily volumes evaporating from more than $67 billion on May 10 to $30 billion as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. The meteoric 2021 crypto bull run has seen the average transaction fees associated with using Bitcoin or the Ethereum mainnet frequently skyrocket to unprecedented levels in recent months.In February 2021, Bitcoin’s fees nearly tripled in two weeks following a Feb. 8 announcement that Tesla added $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to its balance sheet.The news sparked a surge in crypto speculation, with the price breaking its former high of $40,000 before topping out at $54,410. Data from CoinGecko shows that 24-hour volume for Bitcoin (BTC) increased by nearly double from $57 billion on Feb. 7 — the day before Tesla’s announcement — to $101 billion on Feb. 23.The average price of Bitcoin fees again surged to a record high of $62.77 on April 21 after the price of BTC spiked to tag a local top of $64,804 on April 14. Bitcoin’s fees peaked on April 21, sparked by an increase in market activity as the markets began showing weakness as traders raced each other to cash out near the highs.Data from YCharts also shows that average Ethereum fees have dropped from May 20’s record high of $72.21 to just $4.80 — a 93% reduction in less than two weeks. Increasing adoption of Ethereum-powered decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens saw average fees increase from $3.50 at the beginning of the year to new highs of nearly $40 by the end of February.  While developers sought to discipline the fee markets through April’s Berlin hard fork, a speculative frenzy surrounding Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other ERC-20 dog tokens drove further congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, again pushing fees to record highs last month. Ethereum’s transaction fees last established a new all-time high of $71.21 on May 19, with Cointelegraph reporting that a rush of traders racing to exit leveraged positions on-chain amid plummeting crypto prices was responsible for the hike. Complex smart contract transactions incurred fees of more than 10 times the average at the peak of the market turmoil, with CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors claiming to have paid more than $1,000 for a single transaction."
2021-05-31,"  As Bitcoin's price shows new signs of bullish momentum, data from various on-chain indicators suggests that the current sell-off is reaching an end. Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase following its May 19 crash from $42,600 to $30,000 on Coinbase. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered its losses quickly and reclaimed $40,000, but it failed to log a clear bullish breakout above this resistance level, and at the time of writing, the price remains pinned below $40,000.The latest price action in the Bitcoin (BTC) market has been, at best, choppy, with traders showing no clear indication of their short-term bias. Some analysts have predicted that if the BTC/USD price does not break above $40,000, it may very well fall to as low as $20,000 in the coming days.Interestingly, a handful of on-chain indicators tell a different story. One of the most interesting themes holding Bitcoin's bullish bias intact is witnessing long-term holders and accumulation addresses stacking more BTC during the recent price dip. Furthermore, a metric known as the ""Bitcoin Entity-Adjusted SOPR"" (spent output profit ratio) shows that the market is no longer selling Bitcoin at a loss on aggregate.Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that exchanges saw a decline in their reserves, a signal that traders have been withdrawing their digital assets to cold wallets or depositing them into decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pools for more lucrative returns.While the short-term perspective may be tilted toward bears, the following three on-chain indicators hint that Bitcoin's price could be in the process of bottoming out.The correction in Bitcoin's price resulted in three kinds of reactions in the spot market. The first involved panic-selling by short-term traders who sold Bitcoin to minimize their losses, probably because they bought the cryptocurrency near its top. The second reaction involved HODLERs who decided to hold on to their exiting Bitcoin supply. They showed a long-term conviction in Bitcoin's bullish bias against supportive macroeconomic fundamentals — such as ultra-low interest rates, poor yields on government bonds, inflation fears and a declining U.S. dollar — that made hedging assets like Bitcoin look attractive to HODL.The best way to build wealth with #Bitcoin is to be boring. 2 fast, quick, simple, steps:1. Buy 2. HODLIt's really that simple.The third reaction was a mix of HODLers and accumulators, with traders utilizing the Bitcoin price dip to buy more of the cryptocurrency at a ""discount.""Various on-chain indicators show a huge contrast between the Bitcoin reserves held by short-term holders and long-term holders during the price crash. For example, the ""Bitcoin: Spent Output Age Bands"" chart below saw a greater amount of selling last week coming from coins that were between one day and one week old. These coins kept moving in and out of the market, accurately reflecting the state of higher price volatility in the market last week.Meanwhile, coins that remained unspent for one to three months and three to six months also changed addresses in the wake of the recent price crash.Another Glassnode metric dubbed ""Bitcoin: Total Supply Held By Long-Term Holders"" shows that long-term holders — entities that hold Bitcoin for more than six months — became the largest beneficiaries of the tokens sold by the short-term holders.In a weekly note to clients, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital and founder of Pomp Investments, said:This divergence pointed to long-term stability in Bitcoin's price as more and more serious holders took positions against the ongoing macroeconomic crisis.The net Bitcoin reserves held by cryptocurrency exchanges have also declined in the past seven days, showing that fewer and fewer traders now want to sell their Bitcoin holdings.The metric points to a typical trading behavior. Traders only deposit Bitcoin to their exchange wallets when they want to either sell it for fiat or trade it for other digital assets. As a result, the BTC reserves on trading platforms rise.Conversely, a higher degree of BTC withdrawals reflects traders' decision to hold the cryptocurrency. It means that Bitcoin will not face immediate sell-off pressure in the spot market, which is what the latest Glassnode readings show.The total number of accumulation addresses and the balance within these wallets are rising. An accumulation address is the one that has received at least two BTC transactions but has never moved the assets out of the address.In the last seven days, the number of these accumulation addresses has climbed, adding 7,430 new wallets to the list.Another metric dubbed ""Bitcoin: Supply Held by Entities with Balance 0.01 – 0.1"" shows that new users entered the Bitcoin network during the price dip. Additionally, the supply held by addresses that have between 0.001 BTC and 1 BTC in them increased in tandem, showing steady growth in retail interest."
2021-05-31,"  Bitcoin and altcoins are attempting to start a relief rally, suggesting traders have decided to start buying at lower levels.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) massive drop in May 2021 is among its worst monthly performances, according to data from Bybt. The decline has divided the crypto community, with long-term investors considering the fall as a buying opportunity while short-term traders are dumping their positions out of fear.Glassnode data suggests that long-term HODLers and miners are using the current weakness to accumulate Bitcoin. This transfer of Bitcoin from weaker hands to stronger hands is a positive sign because long-term investors are unlikely to panic and dump their holdings on every bear market correction.In April, the U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index soared by 3.1% compared to a year ago, the biggest increase over 12 months since July 1992. This indicates that inflation is knocking on the doors. Several institutional investors may use the current correction to add Bitcoin to their portfolios as it is an uncorrelated asset and many consider it as a good hedge against inflation.Therefore, a sharp plunge below $30,000 looks unlikely. However, that does not mean a new bull market will start in a hurry. The price is likely to remain volatile and range-bound before the start of a sustained uptrend. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels.Bitcoin is in a downtrend. The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in negative territory suggest the bears have the upper hand. However, the bulls have other plans as they are trying to start a relief rally.The BTC/USDT pair has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. If the bulls push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could start a move to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $44,750 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($50,161). Such a move will suggest that the downtrend could be over.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakdown and close below the support line of the triangle will indicate the resumption of the downtrend. The bears could then pull the price down to $30,000 and if this level cracks, the selling may intensify and the pair could drop to $28,000 and then $20,000.Ether (ETH) has rebounded sharply off the support line of the symmetrical triangle as traders attempt to put a higher low. The price could now challenge the resistance line of the triangle where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance.If the bulls push the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 61.8% retracement level at $3,362.72. Such a move will suggest strong buying at lower levels. A break above $3,362.72 may signal an end of the downtrend.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($2,756) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest the sellers have a minor advantage.If the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the bears will try to sink the price below the support line of the triangle. If they succeed, the pair may retest the May 23 panic low at $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) slipped below the $306.61 support on May 29 but the bears could not sustain the selling pressure at lower levels. The altcoin quickly bounced back above $306.61 on May 30, suggesting accumulation on dips.The bulls will now try to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($400), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.The bears will then try to pull the price down to $211.70. On the contrary, if the bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA and the $428 resistance, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($512).Cardano (ADA) dipped below the 50-day SMA ($1.51) on May 29 but the bears could not capitalize on the breakdown. The altcoin bounced back above the 50-day SMA on May 30, indicating buying at lower levels.The flat 20-day EMA ($1.61) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This balance will tilt in favor of the buyers if they can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. The ADA/USDT pair could then rally to $1.94 and if this level is crossed, the next stop could be a retest of the all-time high at $2.47.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will once again try to break the $1.33 support. If they succeed, the pair could drop to $1.24 and then $1. The bears pulled XRP below the $0.88 support on May 29 but they could not sustain the lower levels. The altcoin bounced back above $0.88 on May 30, indicating strong buying by the bulls.If the buyers can propel the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.08), it will suggest that a short-term bottom has been made at $0.65. The XRP/USDT pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.32) and later to the downtrend line.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the bears will try to pull the price back below $0.80. If they manage to do that, the pair may challenge the $0.65 support.The volatility in Dogecoin (DOGE) has reduced due to lack of aggressive buying or selling by traders. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating the bears have the upper hand.If the price turns down from the 20day EMA ($0.36), the bears will try to pull the price below the critical support at $0.21. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern. The pair could then correct to $0.10 and then $0.05.Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $0.47. A breakout of this resistance could result in a rally to $0.59.Polkadot (DOT) is trying to rebound off the support at $17.50. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not waiting for a dip to $15 to buy. The altcoin could rise to the $26.50 level, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 40 suggest the bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from $26.50, the DOT/USDT pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The next bullish move could start if the buyers push the price above $26.50. That could result in a rally to $31.28 and then to the 50-day SMA ($33). Alternatively, the next leg of the downtrend could start if the bears sink the price below $15.Uniswap (UNI) is in a downtrend but the bulls are trying to form a higher low at $21.50. The price rebounded off this support on May 30 and the bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($28.27) and the overhead resistance at $30.If they succeed, it will suggest the downtrend could be over in the short term. The UNI/USDT pair may then rally to the 50-day SMA ($33.94). This level may act as stiff resistance but if the bulls can clear the hurdle, the pair could rise to $38.15.The downsloping 20-day EMA suggests the bears have the upper hand but the RSI above 44 suggests the bulls are making a comeback.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $21.50. Such a move could result in a decline to the May 23 low at $13.04. Internet Computer (ICP) broke below the $120 to $168 range on May 28 but the bears have not been able to pull the price below the immediate support at $103.71. The price is stuck between $103.71 and $120 for the past three days.This tight-range trading indicates indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the ICP/USDT pair could challenge the May 19 low at $86.01. A break below this support could pull the price down to $60.On the other hand, if the bulls push and sustain the price above $120, it will suggest a lack of sellers at lower levels. The pair could then gradually move up to $168. A breakout and close above $168 could start a relief rally that may reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $243.08.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is attempting to rise above $685.36. If bulls sustain the price above this overhead resistance, the altcoin could rise to the 20-day EMA ($821), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. If the bears sink the price below $600, the BCH/USDT pair could fall to $468.13.On the contrary, if the bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that demand exceeds supply. That could start a rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $919.60 and then to the 50% retracement level at $1,059.07.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-30,"  Traders are using a variety of strategies to determine whether Bitcoin’s price has bottomed, but on-chain activity and derivatives data hint that the situation remains precarious. Traders are using various strategies to determine whether Bitcoin’s price has bottomed, but on-chain activity and derivatives data hint that the situation remains precarious.Has Bitcoin’s price bottomed yet? According to Twitter user Noshitcoins, derivatives and on-chain data signal that further downside could be in store.Traders have been trying to time the much-anticipated trend reversal ever since Bitcoin (BTC) initiated its 48% correction to $30,000 on May 12. The move culminated with $12 billion worth of futures long positions being liquidated, and to date, trader confidence remains somewhat dampened.The community started looking everywhere for trend reversal signs, including technical patterns, United States CPI inflation data and Bitcoin exchange deposits. For example, some analysts have stated that a higher high, followed by a move above $40,000, would be enough.We need to make a new Higher High to confirm a local bottom.Reclaim 40k and we can start talking about a sustained move back to 50k.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/myeWXIYWppHowever, two days later, Bitcoin managed to break the $40,000 level, although the move didn’t last for more than six hours. Meanwhile, other traders inferred that a retest of the $30,000 bottom is needed before a bounce.#Bitcoin $BTC #BTC is forming a Descending Broadening wedge here. It's bullish but there are two possible scenarios.Green: breaking the resistance and maintain the uptrend.Red: retest the bottom of the wedge (~30k) and bounce from there. pic.twitter.com/8L26kQvf7XAlthough there could be empirical evidence or even logic backing those statements, market prices don’t always react to external news or previous chart formations. Unlike stocks, Bitcoin investors can’t rely on commonly used valuation multiples or even comparables.Sure, a digital store of value is one use case, but at the same time, it is uncensorable and easily transferable. Furthermore, some users value Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer fiat convertibility outside of Know Your Customer-regulated exchanges. Another factor to consider is the investors who are increasing their Bitcoin portfolio due to the lack of correlation with traditional financial assets.This panacea of diverse and sometimes conflicting narratives creates barriers for modeling the market’s potential, adoption status and even measuring the effectiveness of recent developments. Some will cheer for Tesla and large companies building up Bitcoin reserves, while others couldn’t care less about who’s holding BTC and instead focus on the challenges of scalability and fungibility.Call options allow the buyer to acquire Bitcoin at a fixed price when the contract expires. Put options, on the other hand, provide insurance for buyers and protect against price drops.Whenever market makers and professional traders lean bullish, they will demand a higher premium on call (buy) options. This trend will cause a negative 25% delta skew indicator. On the other hand, if downside protection is more costly, the skew indicator will become positive.A 25% delta skew oscillating between a negative 10% and a positive 10% is usually deemed neutral. This balanced situation held until May 16, as Bitcoin lost the critical $47,000 support, which had held for 76 days.As the markets deteriorated, so did the 25% delta skew indicator, and the cost of protective options spiked. Therefore, until the metric establishes a more neutral pattern nearer to the 5% level, it seems premature to call the market bottom.Traders also monitor the number of BTC that has been active lately. This indicator can’t be deemed bullish or bearish by itself, as it does not provide information on how old the involved addresses are.The 500% price rally from Oct. 1, 2020, and the $64,900 peak on April 14, 2021, caused a major increase in the supply moved in the months before the rally. When this metric presents a sharp decrease, it indicates that investors are no longer interested in participating at the current price level.There are currently 2.2 million BTC active over the past 30 days, and this is significantly higher than levels seen before October 2020. As things currently stand, traders should not be so that Bitcoin has bottomed, at least until the market no longer has relevant activity surrounding the sub-$40,000 level.

2021-05-30,"  MATIC, EOS, XMR and AAVE could rally higher over the coming days if Bitcoin price can sustain within the $30,000 to $33,000 support zone. Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to sustain any price level during the current pullback, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels. Does this mean that the bull trend is over and the institutional investors are abandoning the crypto markets?No! It is the other way around. Glassnode’s weekly newsletter pointed out that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium is rising, suggesting that institutional investors are accumulating at lower levels.GBTC is not alone, another popular vehicle for institutional investors, the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has also witnessed strong capital inflows. According to analysts at Glassnode, this shows “early signs of renewed institutional interest.""Another metric that may be signaling a possible bottom in Bitcoin is its dominance chart, which looks similar to the early part of 2017. If Bitcoin’s dominance follows a similar trajectory to 2017, it will indicate that Bitcoin is still some distance away from its peak and altcoin season still has room to run.Now that the monthly options and futures expiry has passed, investors are likely wondering if Bitcoin could start a sharp recovery next week and which altcoins will rally if that happens. Let's look at 5 cryptocurrencies that could start trending moves this week.Bitcoin’s brief breakout could not clear the hurdle at the 200-day simple moving average ($41,014) on May 26 and 27, indicating the bears are defending this level aggressively. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($41,327) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the oversold zone suggest the bears are in control.If the BTC/USDT pair breaks the $33,000 support, the next stop could be the $30,000 to $28,000 support zone. If this zone also gives way, the pair may witness panic selling and a drop to $20,000 is possible. The longer the price stays below the 200-day SMA, the more difficult it will become for the bulls to start the next leg of the uptrend.However, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 200-day SMA, it will suggest strong buying at lower levels. That could clear the path for a possible rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $48,231.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. If bears sink the price below the triangle, the pair could drop to $30,000 and then to the pattern target at $20,316.On the other hand, the setup may act as a reversal pattern if bulls push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the triangle. Such a move will suggest the downtrend is over and the pair could rally to the target objective at $51,951.Polygon (MATIC) has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($1.58) today, indicating that bulls are buying on dips to this support. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.However, the MATIC/USDT pair has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. If bulls push the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could rise to $2.70 and then start its journey to the pattern target at $4.20.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could extend its stay inside the triangle. A break and close below the triangle will signal weakness and could result in a drop to $0.80.The 4-hour chart shows the relief rally is facing resistance at the downtrend line. If the bears sink the price below the $1.51 support, the pair will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern that could result in a drop to $0.68.Conversely, if buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the bullish momentum could pick up and the pair could challenge the $2.43 resistance. A break above this level could result in a rally to $2.70.EOS attempted a recovery, which fizzled out at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.89 on May 27. However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the $5.60 support. This indicates that traders are not waiting for a deeper fall to buy. If bulls can push and close the price above the 20-day EMA ($6.95), it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could open the doors for a rally to the 50% retracement level at $9.23 and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $10.57.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears stall the next pullback attempt at the 20-day EMA or at $7.89. Such a move will increase the possibility of a break below $5.60. If that happens, the EOS/USDT pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($4.52) and then to $3.57.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are defending the $5.60 support, indicating that the selling pressure has reduced. The flat 20-EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If bulls push the price above $6.81, the pair could rally to the 200-SMA and then to $8.69. A breakout and close above this resistance will signal that bulls are back in the game. Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below the $5.60 to $5 support zone, the pair could drop to $3.57.Repeated attempts by the bears to sink Monero (XMR) below the 200-day SMA ($222) have failed in the past few days. This suggests that bulls are accumulating at the current levels.The buyers attempted to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($294) on May 29 but the long wick on the candlestick shows strong selling at higher levels. However, the bulls are again likely to attempt to clear the hurdle at the 20-day EMA.If they succeed, the XMR/USDT pair could start a relief rally that may reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $368.45. This level may act as a stiff resistance because traders who had bought at higher levels may close their positions.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down and plummets below the 200-day SMA. In such a case, the pair may drop to $175 and then to $124.69.The 4-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle formation, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. The flattish 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.This advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above the triangle. The price could then rally to the 200-SMA, which may act as a stiff resistance.On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the triangle, the pair could drop to $175 and then to $124.69.AAVE is attempting to rebound off the strong support at $280. This level has not been broken on a closing basis since Jan. 26, hence the bulls are likely to defend it aggressively. The 200-day SMA ($290) just above the level is an added advantage. However, the downsloping 20-day EMA ($398) and the RSI below 43 suggest the short-term trend favors the bears. The sellers will try to stall any relief rally at the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the AAVE/USDT pair may again correct to $280. A break and close below this support could start a downtrend and the decline could extend to $160. Conversely, if the bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to $489, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls bought the dip to $280. The 20-EMA is flattening out, indicating the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rally to $418. A breakout and close above this resistance could result in a rally to $480.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the 20-EMA or the downtrend line and plummets below $280. If that happens, the bears will try to pull the price below the May 23 low at $208.09 and start the downtrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-29,"  Bitcoin dominance patterns are showing similar lows and an eerie resemblance to 2017. So what does this suggest for BTC price? For the purposes of historical comparison, it’s also worth noting that the pattern of the dominance chart currently looks much like it did during the earlier part of 2017.As the markets have gone into meltdown since May 12, Bitcoin (BTC) dominance has fluctuated dramatically, bucking 2021’s prevailing trend. Before the sell-off started in earnest, BTC dominance had been falling pretty steadily from around 70% in January to a low of under 40% by the time the crash was underway. At that point, BTC dominance was at its lowest since the summer of 2018. It has since recovered to above 43%.If the same pattern is underway this time around, then the market is likely to be at the equivalent of summer 2017 when the alt season was just ramping up, and still some months away from Bitcoin’s price peak of around $20,000 in December 2017.Of course, while the patterns draw some interesting parallels, BTC dominance doesn’t necessarily tell that much about price. But it does offer insights into how the flagship asset is performing in relation to the rest of the markets, underpinning certain trends. So, what are the likely scenarios for BTC dominance, and what would it mean for the markets?The money flow model is one potential predictor of where the markets could go. The model states that money flows from fiat into Bitcoin, and then down from large caps, through mid-caps to small-cap altcoins before redirecting back to BTC and, ultimately, back to fiat.This model is interesting because it pretty much sums up what happened in 2017, except that the cycle played out twice as BTC surged toward the end of the year. So, if the 2017 scenario repeats itself, BTC dominance could continue to rise until the flagship asset sees another price peak, then fall as alt season accelerates once again.Along with the eerie similarities of the dominance charts, the behavior of the alt markets also offers some indication that they could be performing according to historical cycles. In early May, Cointelegraph reported that altcoins had flipped their previous cycle high to support — a move that last happened in 2017.If the cycle repeats, it could still launch the alt markets to stratospheric new heights in 2021. While the performance observed during May may not offer much reassurance in this regard, there’s also nothing yet to indicate that BTC and the broader markets won’t perform according to long-term trends. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of exchange FTX and Alameda Research, told Cointelegraph:For individual investors looking to follow the money flow, there is one big consideration. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Robert W. Wood, managing partner at Wood LLP, warned: “The elephant in the room for diversification is taxes.” He added: “Up until 2018, many investors could claim that a swap of one crypto for another was nontaxable under section 1031 of the tax code. But the law was changed at the end of 2017.”Indeed, Omri Marian, director of the Graduate Tax Program at University of California, Irvine School of Law, confirmed that crypto-to-crypto transactions are likely to trigger tax obligations, explaining to Cointelegraph:Shane Brunette, CEO of CryptoTaxCalculator, put it into practical terms, telling Cointelegraph: “If an investor switches between BTC and altcoins, the capital gain/loss would be realized in this financial year, regardless of whether or not they’ve ‘cashed out’ to fiat.” Furthermore, he clarified that “The activity would reset the length of time the investor has been holding the asset which would impact the eligibility to claim a long-term capital gains discount.”So, be mindful that following the money flow may come with its own set of costs, and as a result, there are no guarantees that the pattern may repeat, as new variables may have an effect.The most critical difference between 2017 and now is the presence of institutions in the markets. At least, that’s true for Bitcoin and, to some extent, large-cap altcoins such as Ether (ETH). Large swathes of the alt markets, including almost all low-cap coins and memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), are dominated by retail traders and investors.Examining the dominance charts, BTC seemed to get a boost at the end of 2020 as institutional interest in cryptocurrencies started to pique. Its dominance continued to rise until around January. But there’s some evidence that institutions could be behind the recent boost to BTC dominance. On May 21, it emerged that whales had bought $5.5 billion worth of BTC while prices were below $36,000; two days later, crypto hedge funds MVPQ Capital, ByteTree Asset Management and Three Arrows Capital all confirmed they were dip buyers. So, there’s a chance that Bitcoin’s sudden dominance recovery may not come down to regular market cycles but instead be influenced by institutional whales scooping up discounted BTC. The question is: To what extent will the involvement of institutions make a difference to BTC dominance patterns compared with what was seen in 2017? Perhaps the most critical difference between institutions and retail investors is that institutions are far more likely to follow prevailing market conditions and go risk-off accordingly. Therefore, BTC dominance is rising as investors choose to step away from risk-on alts.Related: For the long haul? When Bitcoin nosedived, institutions held fastHowever, based on the “buying the dip” reports, it seems there’s no reason to assume that investors are going as far as going risk-off from crypto itself — at least for now. Furthermore, bullish sentiments continue to swirl around, undeterred by the market chaos of recent weeks as seen by the reports that interest in BTC appears to still be on the rise.Therefore, there’s still every chance that if interest in BTC continues to hold, and no major bad news comes in to destroy the sentiment around crypto, the money flow model may still play out once again. For now, if history holds firm, some further increases in BTC dominance will take place before investors once again start to expand into large-cap altcoins."
2021-05-28,"  Bitcoin price hangs slightly above $35,000 while traders simply watch the dip from the sidelines. The cryptocurrency market faced a new wave of selling pressure on May 28 as Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to $35,100 and traders seem generally disinterested in buy the dip ahead of the weekend.Despite the downside moves seen across the market over the past couple 2 weeks, institutional investors have for the most part held firm in their resolve to stay committed to cryptocurrencies but the absence of 'we bought the dip' announcements have retail traders wondering if Bitcoin price is in for further downside.While some analysts see the possibility of Bitcoin falling as low as $20,000 as the worst case scenario, the overall price trajectory of BTC remains skewed to the upside with the weekly trend of higher lows still intact. #BTC has already set in a Higher Low on the WeeklyNow $BTC is fighting to preserve its series of Higher Lows on the Daily#Crypto #BitcoinAltcoins also pulled back sharply on Friday as market uncertainty ahead of the Memorial Day weekend led to a low volume and the current risk-averse environment diminished the impact of significant announcements like Polygon (MATIC) integrating its datasets into Google Cloud technology. 1/ We are extremely thrilled to share that we have completed an integration of Polygon datasets into @GoogleCloudTech #BigQuery!This means that you can query Polygon’s datasets, run analytics and extract insights using Google’s #BigQuery platform.https://t.co/lKNcv7ru2D pic.twitter.com/U1HGDTqo8LDespite the market-wide pullback, there were a few tokens that managed to rally.

2021-05-28,"  Each breakout from Bitcoin and altcoins is being met by selling near the 20-day moving average, a signal that the market could be in for more downside. Earlier this week billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s told Bloomberg that he is considering entering crypto in a big way but this hardly made any difference to crypto prices. This is just another hint that the underlying sentiment is bearish and that crypto markets are not reacting positively to favorable news.However, this does not mean that the bulls have stopped buying. While speaking to Cointelegraph, S2F Capital managing partner and chief investment officer Micah Spruill said that on-chain data shows Bitcoin whales, owning between 1,000 and 10,000 (BTC), and retail traders holding between 0.1 and 1 Bitcoin, are accumulating at lower levels. Accumulation by large players near the lows is a positive sign as it indicates they are bullish for the long term.While speaking at Consensus 2021, ARK Investments CEO Cathie Wood said that emerging market central banks may buy Bitcoin to protect their balance sheets “because they know their currencies are going down and that they will be under attack as reserves go down.”Traders should keep a close watch on the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the crypto sector because that will drive long-term price action. In the short term, traders' sentiment plays a major role in deciding the trend. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine whether crypto prices have bottomed out or not.Bitcoin’s pullback could not even reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $41,269, which suggests that traders are closing their positions on minor rallies. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($42,780) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory suggest that bears are in control.If the BTC/USDT pair plummets below $34,000, the decline could extend to the critical support at $30,000. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively. If the price turns up from the current level, the buyers will again try to push the price above the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. If they succeed, the pair could rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $48,231. Such a move will suggest that the pair may have bottomed at $30,000.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $30,000, the selling could intensify as the stops of the dip buyers are likely to get hit. There is a minor support at $28,000 but if that cracks, the next stop could be $20,000.Ether (ETH) broke above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,738.74 on May 26 but the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,888). This suggests traders are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA.The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside.If bears sink the price below $2,378.54, the ETH/USDT pair could decline to $2,079.94. A break below this support could result in a retest of the May 23 low at $1,728.74.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level or the support and breaks above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest a change in sentiment and the pair could then rally to the 61.8% retracement level at $3,362.72.Binance Coin’s (BNB) relief rally hit a wall at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $395.09. A shallow pullback after a sharp decline suggests the bears are unrelenting and they are shorting even on minor rallies.The bears are currently trying to pull the price below the $306.61 support. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could drop to $257.40 and then to $211.70. A strong bounce off this support may keep the pair range-bound between $211.70 and $395.09 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($427), the relief rally could extend to the 50-day SMA ($521). This level may act as a resistance but if the bulls arrest the next decline above $428, it will suggest the downtrend could be over.Cardano (ADA) rose above the 20-day EMA ($1.63) on May 26 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The price turned down from $1.83 and the bears have pulled the altcoin below the $1.55 support today.If the bears sustain the price below $1.43, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $1.24 and then to the critical support at $1. If the price rebounds off $1 once again, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.Alternatively, if the price turns up and rises above $1.58, it will suggest strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price above $2. If they manage to do that, the pair could challenge the all-time high at $2.47.The failure of the bulls to build upon the breakout from the downtrend line suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears resumed their selling on May 27 and have pulled Dogecoin (DOGE) below the 50-day SMA ($0.35).If the price breaks below $0.29, the DOT/USDT pair could drop to $0.25 and then to $0.21. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the selling could intensify and the pair may drop to $0.15 and then $0.10.The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating the bears are in control. This negative view will invalidate if the price reverses direction and breaks above the $0.43 to $0.47 overhead resistance. XRP’s relief rally hit a wall at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.05. This suggests the sentiment is negative and traders are in a hurry to close their long positions on a shallow pullback. If the price breaks and sustains below $0.88, the bears will try to pull the price down to $0.65. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1.14) and the RSI below 40 suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside.A break below $0.65 could open the doors for a further decline to $0.56. On the contrary, if the bulls defend the $0.88 support, the XRP/USDT pair may rise to the 20-day EMA. A breakout of this resistance could result in a rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.34) and the downtrend line.Polkadot (DOT) reached the critical overhead resistance at $26.50 today but the bulls could not drive the price above it. This suggests the bears are defending this level aggressively. If bears pull the price below $19.65, the altcoin could drop to $15. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 39 suggest the bears are in command. A break below $15 will suggest the start of a new downtrend. Conversely, if the bulls defend the $15 level, the DOT/USDT pair may consolidate in a range for a few days.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level or $15 and breaks above $26.50. Such a move could push the pair to $31.28. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the bulls are back in the game.Internet Computer (ICP) has been trading inside the tight range of $120 and $168 for the past few days. Today, the bears are attempting to sink the price below the support of the range at $120.If they succeed, the ICP/USDT pair could drop to the all-time low at $86.01. If this support also cracks, the pair could decline to the next target objective at $60.On the contrary, if the bulls defend the $120 support, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. A breakout and close above $168 will be the first indication that the bulls are back in the game.On a breakout and close above $168, the pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $243.08.Uniswap (UNI) reached the 20-day EMA ($29.58) on May 26 but the bulls could not propel the price above it. This shows the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls have not given up yet. They will make one more attempt to thrust the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($34.27).Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to pull the price down. If the sellers sink the price below $24.40, the pair could drop to $21.50 and then to $18. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had been trading above the $685.36 support for the past three days but the bulls could not push the price to the 20-day EMA ($876). This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.If the price sustains below $685.36, the bears will try to sink the price to the May 23 low at $468.13. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate advantage to the bears.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $802, the bulls will try to propel the price to the 20-day EMA. A breakout and close above the moving averages will suggest the downtrend could be over.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-28,"  A majority of Bitcoin investors that held the cryptocurrency during its turbulent periods stand profitable. Unloading Bitcoin (BTC) spot positions when it starts crashing violently upon forming its all-time highs is a bad investment call, at least according to its historical price action.The flagship cryptocurrency's eleven-year lifetime has seen it undergoing many bullish and bearish cycles. The BTC/USD exchange rate typically rises parabolically. It later trims more than half of those gains down as profitable traders sell the top. But, at the same time, traders who buy bitcoin around its local top suffer longer periods of losses.However, the overall historic price trajectory of Bitcoin remains skewed to the upside. The cryptocurrency bottoms out after every bullish-to-bearish cycle and rebounds all over again to seek new all-time highs. Its weekly timeframe chart shows the price forming consecutive higher highs separated by years — $500 in November 2015, $768 in June 2016, $2,998 in June 2017, $19,891 in December 2017, $41,986 in January 2021, and $64,899 in April 2021.PlanB, the brain behind the widely-circulated Stock to Flow model, which predicts the Bitcoin price at $288,000 by 2024, referred to the cryptocurrency's ability to return profits to patient investors in a tweet Friday morning. The pseudonymous analyst noted that not a single investor who held Bitcoin for more than four years ever suffered losses.He cited the 200-weekly moving average curve as an invisible price floor that held the bitcoin market's bullish bias higher during bearish corrections. The BTC/USD exchange rate tested the said support wave on its downside moves, only to rebound later to newer highs.The statement appeared as the Bitcoin price showed signs of waning bullish momentum. The BTC/USD exchange rate topped near $65,000 in mid-April and corrected to as low as $30,000 on Coinbase almost a month later. As of May 28, the pair's bid among traders was near $37,000.Yes, if you buy bitcoin you buy to hold for a long term or forever. That is how the game is played. Now todays sellers are April buyers, that is unusual, that is weak hands.Meanwhile, PlanB's long-term projects make Bitcoin appears like an asset that would keeping siphoning capital out of traditional markets. The analyst wrote earlier that he anticipates people to buy the cryptocurrency for its underlying scarcity — there can be only 21 million BTC in existence.""Silver, gold, countries with [a] negative interest rate (Europe, Japan, US soon), countries with predatory governments (Venezuela, China, Iran, Turkey, etc.), billionaires and millionaires hedging against quantitative easing (QE), and institutional investors discovering the best performing asset of last 10 yrs"" will influence people to seek safety in bitcoin, wrote PlanB in his 2019 paper, ""Modeling Bitcoin Value with Scarcity,"" as he envisioned a trillion-dollar market cap for the cryptocurrency.The model prompts investors who bought Bitcoin at around $65,000 to hold the asset even if it takes more than four years for them to make their investments even. That is applicable only if Bitcoin continues to follow the stock-to-flow price model trajectory.A stock-to-flow model is commonly used to measure commodity scarcity but may also be applied to #Bitcoin to generate actionable insights around $BTC's supply. Learn more here:  https://t.co/xZHtx86y0R pic.twitter.com/wF3c1JEB6HA logarithmic curve chart based on the same bullish model anticipates the BTC/USD rates to fall to $20,000 or lower. The downside target appears after sketching a Fibonacci graph between the curve's upper and lower bands. Its uppermost deviation sits near $111,590, while the lowest one is around $17,150.The logarithmic curve's historical significance in predicting price bottoms and tops makes it relevant enough for investors to realize their potential long and short targets.Despite their accuracy, the stock-to-flow model and its derivatives have attracted criticism for its unrealistic bullish portrayals of scarcer assets. Charlie Morris, co-founder, and CIO of crypto data firm ByteTree, told CoinTelegraph in November last year that bitcoin's lower supply against higher demand does not guarantee higher prices.People will still be able to sell bitcoin from existing active supply to meet the market's demand, argued Morris.Nico Cordeiro, the chief investment officer and fund manager at Strix Leviathan, also criticized the core assertion of scarcity-based Bitcoin pricing models, noting that no evidence suggests that supply dictates the U.S. dollar market valuation of monetary goods (gold, silver, or Bitcoin).The past performance is not a guarantee of future results. But with Bitcoin gaining momentum among institutional circles in the wake of lower-yield investment safe-haven alternatives (government bonds, the U.S. dollar, etc.), it looks appealing to many to just “hodl” the token until further notice. Fortune favors the HODL.Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-27,"  The money printer is going brrr in the United States. Bitcoin (BTC) may get a boost to finally clear $40,000 at the expense of the U.S. dollar as United States President Joe Biden's new $6 trillion federal spending budget proposal is unveiled.On May 28, the United States president will announce the massive fiscal policy, the largest since the Second World War, to ensure investments in major infrastructure, education and healthcare projects, reported The New York Times on May 27. Biden reportedly wants the federal government to spend $6 trillion in 2022. He also plans to raise the total spending to $8.2 trillion by 2031.Biden had earlier proposed significant tax hikes on America's richest companies and individuals to fund his massive spending program. But it would take the government at least until 2030 to shrink its budget deficits, the Times reported. That means the United States would face a monumental debt burden as it borrows money to finance Biden's record proposal.The scenario, per recent history, serves as an ideal bullish backstop for Bitcoin. The decentralized cryptocurrency rallied 1,582% from its $3,858 low in March 2020 as the U.S. government ramped up spending to unprecedented levels to combat the coronavirus pandemic. On the other hand, the U.S. dollar strength index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, crashed by up to 13.38% after topping out in March 2020 amid the global market crash.Meanwhile, Anthony ""Pomp"" Pompliano, a well-renowned Bitcoin lobbyist and founder of Pomp Investments, predicts further declines in dollar bids.""The government is proposing to push our country further into debt while simultaneously destroying the value of our currency,"" Pompliano said. ""Historians will write that the government accelerated the destruction of the world reserve currency as the citizens cheered them on.""Other analysts also jumped in to propose Bitcoin — with its fixed supply — as a remedy against a steepening U.S. debt curve.US President Joe Biden set to announce $6 Trillion budget.  Debt as a % of GDP will rise to highest levels since World War II.  Buy #Bitcoin#bitcoin has no top because fiat has no bottom pic.twitter.com/Zl3AygwVsBThe New York Times' coverage caused jitters during the early morning U.S. trading session, with the DXY falling by a modest 0.01% at the New York opening bell while Bitcoin reclaimed $40,000.The BTC/USD exchange rate tested its 200-day simple moving average (the orange wave in the chart above) — which sits at around $40,756 — for a breakout move to the upside. If achieved, the pair would eye a close above its 20-day exponential moving average (the green wave) — near $43,655 — to confirm its short-term bullish bias."
2021-05-26,"  Altcoins moved higher, while a lack of buy volume prevented Bitcoin and Ether price from breaking out after the completion of a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. On Wednesday, the bullish momentum that had propelled Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins into a relief rally was somewhat subdued, as traders remain unsure of what may happen next. After an early morning attempt by Bitcoin bulls to drive BTC’s price above $40,000 was met with stiff resistance, the digital asset lost momentum and slumped back to the $38,000 support level. Despite the continued struggle, a few positive signs such as a decline in BTC exchange deposits and an uptrend in addresses accumulating Bitcoin suggest that bears have stopped selling and the worst of the downturn may have passed. Earlier in the day, Ether (ETH) also rallied close to the $3,000 level, but the pullback in BTC price saw the top altcoin fall below $2,800. While a majority of the cryptocurrencies are well below recently established highs, Polygon’s (MATIC) price bucked the trend by seeking out a clear V-shaped recovery. The altcoin rallied higher today as the project announced the launch of its SDK stack that will allow developers to easily deploy their own Ethereum-connected blockchains.Since Tuesday, MATIC has rallied 50% from a low of $1.51 to an intraday high at $2.44 on Wednesday.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for MATIC have been favorable for some time. The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for MATIC has been in the green zone for most of the past week, and it registered a high of 94 several times on Tuesday, around seven hours before the price increased 50% over the next day.Other notable altcoin performances include an 89% gain for Skale Network (SKL) and a 67% rally from Enjin Coin (ENJ). Origin Protocol also gained 53%. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.7 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-05-26,"  Bitcoin price is struggling to regain the $42,000 support as bears hold a $585-million advantage ahead of Friday’s $2.1-billion BTC options expiry. A total of 53,400 Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expiry on Friday. At first sight, bulls appear to lead as the $2.1-billion open interest call (buy) to put (sell) options ratio stands at 1.32, favoring the neutral-to-bullish derivatives.However, after Bitcoin dropped 33% in May, the right to acquire BTC at $46,000 and above is essentially worthless since there is less than 38 hours left before expiry. On May 20, Cointelegraph reported that “May 28 will be no different with $1.95 billion open interest. While it seems premature to call it, bears will likely continue to pressure markets, considering there are almost no call options at $38,000 or lower for next week.”After a brief retrace above $42,000 on May 20, Bitcoin entered another correction after a government statement from China revealed plans to “crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risk.”On Sunday, the Huobi exchange reportedly suspended futures trading in mainland China, causing further havoc and pushing Bitcoin below $32,000.As expected, bears continued to have the advantage from the previous week and have still been able to pin Bitcoin’s price below $42,000. For the neutral-to-bullish call options, there is not much gain in rolling over a losing position to the following week, so bulls will face an uphill battle going into Friday’s expiry.The previous week’s expiry gains created room for the bears to further place bets on Bitcoin’s price remaining below $45,000 or $50,000.Take notice of how there are only 2,550 BTC call options at $42,000 or lower, representing a mere 8% of the outstanding. This notional is equivalent to a $100-million open interest. As explained earlier, the call (buy) options at $46,000 and higher are already worthless.Meanwhile, bears hit another home run as most bets were placed at $36,000 and higher. The 17,600 BTC put (sell) options above such a level represent a $685-million open interest, giving the neutral-to-bearish derivatives a $585-million advantage.It is worth noting that BTC’s regular spot exchange volumes have been trading over $10 billion per day. However, the fact that the futures and options expiry happens simultaneously can accentuate volatility. Keep in mind that futures contract buyers and sellers are matched at all times. Thus, trying to predict which side will exert more pressure is a futile effort.Deribit, OKEx and Bit.com expiries take place on Friday at 8:00 am UTC. The CME futures and options happen a little later on the day at 3:00 pm UTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-26,"  Dip-buyers catalyzed a strong relief rally in Bitcoin and altcoins but decreasing volumes and overhead resistance suggest the market is losing momentum. A strong bull market tends to attract speculators and newbie traders who hop on to the rally with an aim to get rich quickly. In their eagerness to earn huge profits, traders throw caution out of the window and take on excessive leverage. While this strategy is fruitful during the asset’s up-move, sharp corrections wipe out most accounts due to the use of massive leverage.Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent market drop below $30,000 caused the Bitcoin futures open interest to plummet from $27 billion to $11 billion. This suggests that several leveraged traders would have taken a huge hit. Although painful, these corrections reduce greed and the asset transfers from weak hands to strong hands who venture out to buy when the sentiment is negative.While many investors are watching the price behavior of Bitcoin to gauge whether the downtrend is over, Ether (ETH) has gradually been covering ground quickly. According to CoinGecko, Ether’s 24-hour trade volume at $60 billion overtook Bitcoin’s at $50 billion. Another positive sign in favor of Ether is that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust’s price is trading at an 11% premium to Ether's spot price, indicating strong demand from institutional investors. In comparison, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust price still trades at a discount to Bitcoin.This suggests that traders should keep an eye on both Bitcoin and Ether to confirm that a bottom is in place. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot any signs of a bottoming formation.Bitcoin broke above the downtrend line on May 24, which suggests strong buying at lower levels. The bears tried to pull the price back below the downtrend line on May 25 but failed. The relief rally rose to $40,841 today but the long wick on the candlestick suggests selling at higher levels. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($43,967) and the relative strength index (RSI) below 38 suggest advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to pull the price down to $34,000. This is an important support to watch because if it cracks, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the critical support at $30,000.On the upside, the bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA to gain the upper hand. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $50,000.Ether’s pullback has risen above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,738.74 today, indicating aggressive buying at lower levels. However, the bears are trying to stall the relief rally near the moving averages. If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to resume the downtrend. The first support on the downside is $2,378.54 and then $2,079.94. If the price rebounds off this support, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.But if the bears sink and sustain the price below $2,000, the ETH/USDT pair could retest the critical support at $1,728.74.Contrary to this assumption, if buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,936), the pair could rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72. Such a move will indicate the short-term downtrend is over.After hesitating near the $348.70 resistance on May 25, Binance Coin (BNB) cleared the hurdle today. This has opened the gates for a move to $428. However, the bears may not give up easily and they are likely to mount a stiff resistance between $428 and the 20-day EMA ($444).If the price turns down from $428 but does not break the $348.70 support, the BNB/USDT pair could start an up-move that could reach the 50-day simple moving average ($523) and then to $600.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and slips below $348.70, the pair could correct to $257.40. Such a move will suggest that bears continue to sell at higher levels and that could delay the confirmation of a bottom. Cardano (ADA) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on May 25 as the bears defended the 20-day EMA ($1.64). The uncertainty resolved to the upside today and buyers have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA.The bulls will now try to push the ADA/USDT pair to $2 and then to the all-time high at $2.47. A break above this resistance could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action.If the price turns down from $2, the pair could drop to $1.55. A strong rebound off this level could keep the pair range-bound between $1.55 and $2 for a few days. A wider range could develop if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($1.47).A tough battle is waging between the bulls and the bears near the downtrend line. Although the bulls had pushed Dogecoin (DOGE) above the downtrend line on May 25, they could not sustain the higher levels. If the bears pull the price back below the downtrend line, it will suggest selling on every minor rally. The bears will then try to sink the price to $0.25 and then retest the panic low formed on May 19 at $0.21.The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.40) and the RSI below 46 suggest the bears are in control. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $0.47. The bulls pushed XRP above the $0.88 resistance on May 24, suggesting the start of the relief rally. The bears tried to sink the price back below $0.88 on May 25 but failed. This indicates the bulls are trying to flip $0.88 to support. The XRP/USDT pair could rally to the 20-day EMA ($1.19), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will again try to break the $0.88 support.If they manage to do that, the pair could retest the May 23 low at $0.65. If this support also cracks, the pair could extend the decline to $0.56.Conversely, if the bulls successfully defend the $0.88 support during the next dip, the pair could rise above the moving averages and rally to the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the up-move.The bulls are attempting to push Polkadot (DOT) to the overhead resistance at $26.50. This level may act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can scale this wall, the altcoin could rally to the 20-day EMA ($30.42).The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest bears are in command. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to pull the price back below $26.50.If they succeed, the DOT/USDT pair could drop to $20 and then to $15. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $15 and $26.50 for a few days. A break below $15 will favor the bears while a break above $31.28 will indicate the downtrend could be over.After the initial slide, Internet Computer (ICP) has been consolidating in a tight range for the past few days. This suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside and the bears sink the price below $103, the ICP/USDT pair could retest the all-time low at $86.01. A break below this level could resume the downtrend with the next target at $60.Conversely, if the bulls propel the price above $168.57, the pair may rally to $186.06 and then to $222.34. A break above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $243.08 could signal that the downtrend could be over.Uniswap (UNI) rebounded sharply on May 24, suggesting strong buying by the bulls at lower levels. The relief rally could now reach the 20-day EMA ($29.59), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the UNI/USDT pair could drop to $21.50. A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment has turned bullish and traders are buying on dips. That will increase the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA.If that happens, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($34.25). This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $21.50. The next support on the downside is $16.49 and then $13.04. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose above the $685.36 resistance on May 24 and the bulls flipped the level into support on May 25, which is a positive sign. If the bulls push the price above $800, the altcoin could rally to the moving averages. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($908) and the RSI below 43 suggest advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USDT pair could drop to $685.36. A bounce off this support will suggest the sentiment has turned positive and the traders are buying on dips. That will enhance the prospects of a break above the moving averages. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $685.36, the pair could drop to $538.11 and then retest the May 23 low at $468.13.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-26,"  BTC price rebounding back to $40,000 is just one of the few signs that the bears may be exhausted. The price of Bitcoin surged higher on May 26, breaching the $40,000 level for the first time in five days as traders brushed aside concerns about China's crypto ban and the United States' crypto tax proposal.The benchmark cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $40,855 before turning lower owing to profit-taking sentiment. In the meantime, analysts such as Cheds and Korous AK expect BTC/USD to hit $42,000 in the short term but advised caution on extended upside positions unless the spot market confirms a clear bullish breakout.Cheds, particularly, showed a bullish conviction if Bitcoin reclaims its 200-day simple moving average (200-day SMA), which is currently around $40,600. The wave has historically served as a strong price floor against long-term bearish trends.Be careful getting too bullish until $BTC #Bitcoin turns both the 42k area and MA 200 back into support on dailyMore support for a bullish Bitcoin outlook came from on-chain data. At least three blockchain-focused metrics showed that the cryptocurrency bottomed out after crashing to $30,000 on May 19.On-chain analytics platform Glassnode revealed earlier on May 26 that the total number of crypto addresses sending Bitcoin to cryptocurrency exchanges declined on a seven-day average timeframe.The metric, dubbed ""Number of Addresses Depositing to Exchanges,"" illustrates the number of unique addresses that appear as a sender in a transaction sending funds to exchanges. Simply put, it shows a decline in the number of new Bitcoin traders who might want to transfer BTC to exchanges to sell it or trade it for other assets.New traders/investors are prone to react more emotionally to wild crypto price swings. But with the Glassnode metric showing a plunge in unique Bitcoin depositors to exchanges, it signals a downtrend in potential selling pressure.Meanwhile, the seven-day average output on Bitcoin's network value-to-transaction (NVT) signal has dropped to a 14-month low, Glassnode data shows.Bitcoin's price reacted bullishly when the NVT signal touched 500 on the hourly chart, as the chart above shows. Based on fractal sentiment alone, the metric now suggests a sharp bullish reversal in the Bitcoin market as it trades 36% above its previous bottom level of $30,000.Another Glassnode metric shows that the latest Bitcoin price dip has done very little in shaking investors' long-term bullish sentiment. The ""Number of Accumulation Addresses"" claimed a record high just as the BTC/USD exchange rate hit $30,000 on May 19, taking the total to above 545,000.#Bitcoin HODL Army is growing through this dip. pic.twitter.com/L8q6vO0rZlGlassnode defines accumulation addresses as those that have at least two incoming Bitcoin transactions and that have never spent funds. The analytics service considers these addresses as long-term holders.A spike in accumulation addresses during the BTC price crash that destroyed billions in leveraged positions shows that bulls with long-term setup absorbed the selling pressure. That marks another sign of bearish exhaustion as Bitcoin attempts to flip $40,000 into a new support level."
2021-05-26,"  Wild price fluctuations are likely in the top two cryptocurrencies as both record a dramatic spike in their 30-day realized volatility charts. The current cryptocurrency market scenario is only for traders who have an extremely high appetite for risks. But for the faint of heart, analysts advise patience and caution ahead.The outlook stands tall for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization that more or less behave as locomotives for the rest of the crypto market. As of Wednesday, the ETH/USD Realized Volatility on a 30-day timeframe has reached near its 2017 peak levels, according to data provided by Skew.Meanwhile, Bybt.com shows Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility at its yearly high, suggesting that the benchmark asset remains at risk of wild price fluctuations in the sessions ahead. Simply put, the top two crypto assets show a likelihood of moving in either direction with a higher degree of volatility. All in all, that could mean both aggressive gains and losses for daytraders.The volatility alarm rings at the time when both Bitcoin and Ether have posted incredible recovery rallies, following their recent price declines. In retrospect, the BTC/USD exchange rate plunged more than 50% after topping near $65,000 in April — a correction partially driven by Elon Musk’s anti-Bitcoin tweets and China’s crypto ban reiteration last week.Ether, whose positive correlation efficiency with Bitcoin currently sits near 0.88, tailed the benchmark digital asset’s bearish correction. The second-largest cryptocurrency experienced a maximum of 60% decline in its market valuation — compared to its record high of $4,380 from mid-April.But bulls saw opportunities in the said price dips, insomuch that they helped Bitcoin and Ether prices recover by up to 36.12% and 68.52% from their local price bottoms, respectively. Some analysts anticipated that the upside retracement would extend further based on supportive macroeconomic catalysts, mainly inflation fears.Tech bull Cathie Wood, who heads Ark Investment Management, reiterated her $500,000 Bitcoin price target after last week’s crash, calling the dip “a really great time to buy.”Ark's Cathie Wood is sticking with her $500,000 target for Bitcoin #TheBusinessweek https://t.co/9eBp5M39Zi pic.twitter.com/VeSRF5fplmNevertheless, many also cautioned traders against buying during a bearish correction phase, especially after a year-long price rally that increases the risks of profit-taking by long-term investors. Analysts at BiotechValley Insights Consulting Group noted that Bitcoin dropped hard even after the United States Consumer Price Index rose to 4.2%, stating that the crypto market is now going through an “anxiety stage.”“I believe Bitcoin has a long way to fall from here,” one of the BiotechValley analysts wrote in a note. “I think it will slowly grind down the slope of hope with a periodic dead cat bounce.”The group called for a $15,000–$16,000 price target for Bitcoin.Koroush AK, an independent market analyst, took a rather middle approach. He advised traders to wait for a clear bounce above short-term resistance levels before determining their market bias, tweeting:The recent rebound has coincided with an increase in the number of outstanding Bitcoin Futures contracts from $11 billion to $11.88 billion, showcasing a steady climb in leveraged positions in the derivatives market. Meanwhile, more than $12 billion worth of long positions has been liquidated since the May 19 price crash."
2021-05-26,"  Bitcoin has surged past $40,000, and the cryptocurrency market is rapidly recovering. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed $40,000 on Wednesda, breaking above a key sell area for the first time in five days.Traders expect a broader rally to come and a bullish market structure to form if Bitcoin continues to rise above $42,000 and Ether (ETH) reclaims $3,000. Bitcoin has been recovering over the past week due to three major factors.First, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor have been encouraging Bitcoin miners to use cleaner energy.Musk and Saylor have gone further since, speaking with Bitcoin miners in the United States about reliable energy consumption.Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.Second, the Bitcoin futures market has reset to a large extent. According to data from Bybt.com, when BTC crashed to below $30,000, the futures market open interest dropped from $27 billion to $11 billion.This means that the futures market is not overcrowded, which raises the probability of a more sustainable and gradual rally.Third, Ether has been rising rapidly over the past few days, which also benefits Bitcoin and altcoins because ETH saw a deeper correction than BTC.Major cryptocurrencies rebounding as a whole is improving the sentiment around Bitcoin, leading to the gradual recovery of the crypto market.In the near term, traders say that $42,000 is the important short-term resistance area, and after that, $49,000 is the macro sell area.A pseudonymous trader known as Pentoshi wrote:In the foreseeable future, the two key things to observe for Bitcoin traders are exchange outflows and the $42,000 level.Ideally, if the $42,000 level holds and Bitcoin exchange outflows increase in tandem, that would mean that the confidence of investors in BTC and whales at above $42,000 is rising.There are concerns that a “dead cat bounce” might form, which is a short-lasting recovery, but if BTC holds $42,000, the chance of a fakeout rally would substantially decrease."
2021-05-26,"  Roughly $60 billion worth of ETH changed hands over the past 24 hours while BTC saw $50 billion in trade. Ethereum is seeing renewed interest in the aftermath of Bitcoin's travails this week, with Ether’s 24-hour trade volume topping BTC’s by a significant margin.However it's still a long way from doubling Bitcoin's volume as some ETH proponents suggested. On May 25, a screenshot of CoinGecko data circulated across Crypto Twitter showing the daily volume of Ether had surpassed $115 billion while Bitcoin’s sat at nearly $53 billion.Speaking to Cointelegraph, CoinGecko’s co-founder and COO, Bobby Ong, revealed the data depicted in the screenshot was not accurate due to either an API error, or wash-trading, resulting in inflated ETH volumes reported by the EXX exchange. Ong stated that Coingecko has since disabled its data feed from EXX. The platform now shows Ether has driven 20% more volume than BTC over the past 24 hours with roughly $60 billion trade compared to Bitcoin’s $50.2 billion. While CoinGecko's Bitcoin page has seen about 75% more traffic than its Ethereum page over the past seven days, the gap has narrowed significantly in the past 24 hours. Ong noted:The surging trade activity and interest has also coincided with institutional fund manager Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) seeing its premium over spot Ether prices bounce up to 11%. while the firm’s Bitcoin Trust has traded at a discount since March. The data suggests that some institutions have turned their focus to Ethereum rather than Bitcoin.This is what I mean, $ETH both on spot exchanges and institutional (grayscale) is flippening $BTC in volume macro Market structure on $ETH is more bullish than BTC tooLook at Goldman's comments as well as other institutional investors, you can see where the money is flowing https://t.co/v7vZoWNkSkEthereum’s volume surged to overtake Bitcoin just days after segments of a leaked report from Goldman Sachs revealed the global investment bank believes Ether has a “high chance of overtaking Bitcoin as a dominant store of value.”The report noted the growth of the burgeoning decentralized finance and nonfungible token ecosystems being built on Ethereum, as well as ETH’s dominance over Bitcoin by total transaction volume. “Ether beats bitcoin as a store of value. The Ethereum ecosystem...provides developers a way to create new apps. Most of DeFi apps are being built on Ethereum. The greater number of transactions in ether vs bitcoin reflects this dominance” - Goldman Sachs Global Macro Research pic.twitter.com/vNkQ1HlDYM"
2021-05-25,"  Will $37,000 hold for more upside in the near term for Bitcoin?  Bitcoin (BTC) prices pulled back on May 25, wiping a small portion of the gains it had made during the previous session amid another day of volatile trading.The BTC/USD exchange rate fell up to 6.11% after opening the Asia-Pacific session at $38,856. The pair met a strong resistance force near its 200-day simple moving average (20-day SMA) that prompted a majority of traders to secure their intraday profits.As a result, the bids for the BTC/USD pair started dropping while heading into the early London session, eventually finding support at a level that was instrumental in limiting the market's bearish trend during the last week's price crash.Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader, called the blacked horizontal line in the chart above — roughly $37,000 — a ""key retest"" level, noting its significance in determining Bitcoin's short-term market bias. The analyst put a blue arrow above the support level that pointed north, stating that he anticipated BTC/USD to bounce back in the coming sessions. ""Bitcoin turns $37,000 into support in the short-term,"" tweeted Rekt Capital. ""But might need to retest that area once again given how strong yesterday's Daily Close was Still on track for following the blue path.""The statement appeared as Bitcoin continued its whipsaw trend, logging sudden intraday reversals of high percentage margins. The choppy price movements reflected an absence of clear directional bias among traders, especially as analysts weighed equally convincing bearish and bullish catalysts against one another.Victor Dergunov, the founder of Albright Investment Group, admitted that he was buying the Bitcoin price dip, adding that he expects the cryptocurrency to at least reach the $40,000-$42,000 area in the near term.""There was enormous volume leading up to and right around $30K, which is what we want to see at the epicenter of the correction process,"" Dergunov explained in his note. Offsetting Dergunov's bullish opinion was portfolio management and analytics firm, the Income Generator. It said the Bitcoin market risked facing the ""worst crypto winter"" in its twelve-year lifetime, citing the U.S. dollar's bullish response to rising inflation figures that could sap investors' appetite for the cryptocurrency.""It now seems as though rising inflation levels might actually work in the opposite direction and bring renewed buying activity back into the U.S. dollar,"" Income Generator said in a note.Meanwhile, Mike McGlone, the senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, noting that he still sees the BTC/USD exchange rate hitting $100,000 on the prospects of a declining supply rate.""Bitcoin has backed up for reasons that support an extended bull market and a path to $100K,"" he said. With ""greener,"" McGlone cited Elon Musk's proposal to create a mining council in North America that could track and subsidize Bitcoin's carbon emissions. The Tesla CEO was instrumental in crashing the bitcoin prices from $59,000 to as low as $30,000 over the past few weeks. He criticized the cryptocurrency for its potential environmental impact and discontinued accepting it as payment for Tesla's electric vehicles."
2021-05-24,"  Bitcoin price briefly tops $40,000 and Ether climbs above $2,600 as traders gain their composure following last week's ""historic deleveraging event."" Crypto traders were greeted by green markets on May 24 as the majority of altcoins saw their prices bounce back following last week's downturn that was the “largest deleveraging event since the March 2020 sell-off,” according to an on-chain report from Glassnode. After suffering the biggest monthly price drop in Bitcoin (BTC) history, bulls now look to stage a comeback with a significant amount of support forming near the $37,000 level, and within the last hour, Bitcoin's price pushed up back to the $40,000 level.The capitulation experienced last week was “one for the history books,” with data from Glassnode showing that the magnitude of realized losses on-chain “eclipsed all previous capitulation events” with a new all-time high of $4.53 billion in losses recorded on May 19 and $14.2 billion recorded for the week as a whole.The $2.56 billion in net on-chain losses seen on May 19 was 185% larger than the March 2020 COVID-19 sell-off, with data indicating that:Not all traders were caught off guard by the move, however, as BTC holders with coins 1 to 3 years old managed to spend their coins earlier in the cycle, “likely rotating capital to capture the price out-performance of ETH at that time.” These entities then stopped selling during the capitulation, while newer hands were seen panic-selling as they sprinted for the exits.Overall, last week's “historical capitulation event” resulted in roughly 9% to 9.5% of the current market capitalization registering as unrealized losses, which is actually quite small when compared with previous losses seen in March 2020 and November 2018.Short-term holders have borne the brunt of the market turndown and “currently hold aggregate unrealized loss of -33.8% of the Market Cap on their coins.”May 24’s price turnaround was a welcome sight for the altcoin market, which was hit especially hard during last week's sell-off.One of the biggest gainers on the day has been Polygon's MATIC, which continues to receive extra attention from the cryptocurrency community as it emerges as the preferred layer-two solution for the Ethereum network.The added focus led to a 100% increase in the price of MATIC on May 24 from a low of $0.837 on May 23 to an intraday high at $1.67, while the Maker's MKR token likewise saw its price rally more than 100% to a high of $4,174.May 24's market turnaround also resulted in a 30% gain in the price of Ether (ETH) back to the $2,500 support level, while Binance Coin (BNB) managed to gain 39% and now trades near $320.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.68 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 44.2%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-24,"  The current relief rally in Bitcoin and altcoins could be a sign that the market is reaching a bottoming phase. The sentiment in the crypto sector is extremely bearish. On May 23, several altcoins dipped below the May 19 panic low, suggesting that traders continue to sell at every opportunity. However, Bitcoin (BTC) did not violate its May 19 panic low at $29,257.95, indicating buying at lower levels.John Bollinger, the creator of the Bollinger Bands indicator, believes Bitcoin could be forming a W-shaped bottom, which may have a good risk to reward ratio.In another positive sign, PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price model, said that a large part of the selling has been done by traders who had purchased in the $55,000 to $60,000 zone in April. These traders dumped about 1 million Bitcoin in the $30,000 to $35,000 zone in May. According to PlanB, the whales have bought aggressively during the current dip, which is a positive sign as “1 million Bitcoin are in strong hands now.”Another insight about Bitcoin whale purchases was shared by Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony Pompliano who referenced data from Glassnode. During the crash on May 19, Bitcoin whales owning between 10,000 and 100,000 Bitcoin bought 122,588 Bitcoin. Several crypto hedge funds interviewed by Bloomberg also said they had been buyers at lower levels.What is clear is that whales have been buying the dips. Does this suggest that a bottom may be in place or could crypto prices fall further? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin broke below the $33,496.82 support on May 23 but the bears could not pull the price down to the May 19 low at $29,257.95. The long tail on the May 23 candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dips aggressively.The buyers are attempting to build upon the recovery today and have pushed the price above the downtrend line. If the bulls can sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to $42,000 and then to the 20-day exponential moving average ($44,965).If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That could keep the pair range-bound between $28,850 and $45,000 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to sustain above the downtrend line, it will suggest that traders are selling on minor rallies. That will increase the possibility of a retest of $28,850. A break below this level could result in a fall to $20,000.Ether (ETH) dipped below the May 19 intraday low at $1,801.60 on May 23 but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively bought at lower levels. The buyers have extended the recovery today, which is a positive sign.The ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,724.05, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from $2,724.05, the bears will make one more attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below $1,703.77 could open the doors for a further decline to $1,547.46 and then $1,289.The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the 20-day EMA ($2,959). Such a move will suggest that the downtrend could be over.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below $233.81 on May 23, completing a 100% retracement of the entire leg of the rally that had started on March 26. However, the long tail on the May 23 candlestick suggests the bulls have not given up yet.The buyers are trying to start a relief rally that may face resistance at $348.70 and then again at $428. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is near the oversold territory, suggesting advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will make another attempt to resume the downtrend. If the sellers break the $211.70 to $200 support zone, the selling could intensify further and the BNB/USDT pair could decline to $120.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls defend the $211.70 support during the next decline, it will suggest that the correction may be over and the pair could then start a bottoming process.Cardano (ADA) again dropped near the $1 support on May 23 and the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dip aggressively. This makes the $1 level an important support to watch out on the downside.The buyers are currently trying to sustain the price above the $1.48 resistance. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the 20-day EMA ($1.62) where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains bearish and the pair could then consolidate between $1 and $1.63 for a few days.Alternatively, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $1.94 and then to the all-time high at $2.34. On the downside, a break below the $1 to $0.95 support zone could result in panic selling.After staying above the 50-day simple moving average ($0.33) from May 20 to 22, Dogecoin (DOGE) broke below it on May 23. However, the bulls bought the dip and are currently attempting to push the price back above the 50-day SMA.The relief rally is likely to face resistance near the downtrend line and then at the 20-day EMA ($0.40). If the price turns down from either resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to break the $0.21 support. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to $0.15 and then to $0.10. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 suggest the bears have the upper hand. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA. In such a case, the pair could rally to $0.47 and then to $0.59.XRP slipped and closed below the $0.88 support on May 23, suggesting the bears are in command. However, the bulls have not given up yet and are trying to push the price back above $0.88 today. If they manage to do that, the altcoin could start a relief rally that may reach the 20-day EMA ($1.22).The bears are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to $0.88 and then to $0.65. A break below this support could result in a decline to $0.56.On the contrary, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above the downtrend line will indicate that the downtrend could be over.After a brief struggle near the $26.50 level on May 20 and 21, the bears asserted their supremacy on May 22 and pulled Polkadot (DOT) lower. The altcoin dropped to $13.63 on May 23 but the bulls purchased this dip forming a long tail on the candlestick.The bulls are attempting to build upon the recovery today, which may reach the breakdown level at $26.50. If the price turns down from this resistance but stays above $15, then a few days of range-bound action is possible.A breakout and close above $26.50 will be the first sign of strength and the momentum could favor the bulls if they can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($31.93).Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the $15 to $13.63 support zone, the DOT/USDT pair could extend the decline to $7.98.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has witnessed a waterfall decline in the past few days, dropping from a high at $1,638.08 on May 12 to a low at $467.58 on May 23, a 71% fall in a short time. Generally, after such a sharp fall, a strong pullback could be expected.If the bulls push and sustain the price above $686.75, the relief rally could extend to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $914.71. This level is likely to act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the BCH/USDT pair could rise to $1,100.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $914, the pair may oscillate between $467.58 and $914 for a few days. A breakdown and close below $442.96 will be a huge negative as that could result in a drop to $370.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the $17.50 to $16 support zone on May 23 and hit a low at $13. However, the long tail on the candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dip.The UNI/USDT pair has started a relief rally today that could reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $25.22. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near the oversold territory suggest the bears have the upper hand.If the price turns down from $25.22, the bears will make one more attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below $13 could open the doors for a drop to the next support at $10. Alternatively, a break above $25.22 could push the price to the 20-day EMA ($30.25). This level is again likely to act as stiff resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the pair could rise to $36.Litecoin (LTC) rebounded off the $118 support on May 23, which suggests buying at lower levels. The bulls are trying to extend the recovery today. If they can push the price above $187.75, the altcoin could reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $230.75.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($246) and the RSI near the oversold territory suggest the bears are in the driver’s seat. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will attempt to sink the price below $118. If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to $95 and then to $80. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the moving averages. Such a move could result in a rally to the 61.8% retracement level at $300.25.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-24,"  One key on-chain indicator provides a bearish outlook for Ethereum’s native token.  On Thursday, the price of Ether (ETH) surged from $2,443 to almost $3,000 — a 13.55% climb, according to Coinbase data. The strong intraday upside move appeared a day after ETH’s 27.61% price crash. It thus raised hopes that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization would eventually recover in the days ahead.But the prices declined nevertheless, leaving an impression that the upside recovery in the Ether market on Thursday was a mere “dead cat bounce” — a small, brief rebound in the price of a falling asset that acts as a bearish continuation pattern despite beginning like a bullish reversal one.On Monday, the ETH/USD exchange rate painted a similar recovery candle. The pair jumped by nearly 20% to $2,474 in a rebound move that followed a 37% decline from Thursday’s closing rate. The strong bullish rebound suggested another dead cat bounce in the making, especially as on-chain indicators painted a bearish picture for Ether.Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moscow-based banking service Moskovski Capital, alerted that the total Ether inflow across all crypto exchanges reached a yearly high of 199,947 ETH on Sunday.In retrospect, many traders prefer to keep their tokens offline, away from their exchange’s custody. Therefore, they only transfer the digital assets to exchanges when they intend to either sell or exchange them for other tokens. Analytics portals track these capital flows to determine traders’ short-term market bias.The record ETH inflow into all the crypto exchanges, said Moskovski, should make bulls careful about their upside bets.“This is the biggest inflow we had this year,” he noted. “If it isn’t an internal [transaction], be careful.”Last week, traders sold off their cryptocurrency holdings on fears that Elon Musk’s Tesla would do the same. The billionaire investor went into a Twitter spat with some of the leading crypto influencers in the week ending on Wednesday, eventually hinting that Tesla would dump its entire $1.5 billion worth of BTC holdings. He later refuted this, saying Tesla did not sell any Bitcoin.IndeedChina also fueled the crypto market’s sell-off further by reiterating its intention to crack down on digital currencies last week. Meanwhile, the United States Treasury Department also announced its plans to regulate larger cryptocurrency transactions, and Musk kept posting cryptic mixed signals. Traders moved top altcoin markets in the range of 10%–30% in either direction based on such updates, pulling Ether into the swing trades alongside.Ether price analysts also posted conflicted ETH/USD scenarios. A chart shared by pseudonymous market pundit the Crypto Cactus showed the pair at risk of crashing toward $1,700 should it slip below an interim support range around the $2,000-area.“ETH is currently hovering around 2,200 USDT, with 2,400 USDT as a short-term resistance level,” detailed Robbie Liu, a researcher at OKEx crypto exchange. “Meanwhile, ETH/BTC has not seen a significant rebound.”Data showed a spike in open interest, noting that investors are opening leveraged positions in the Ether derivatives market after witnessing a long squeeze of over $1.87 billion on Wednesday. The total number of outstanding futures contracts surged from $5.1 billion to $5.7 billion in the last 24 hours.Derivative traders are majority short on ETH/USD, with their long/short ratio lurking at 0.98 as of noon UTC. Ether is currently trading roughly 44% below its record high of $4,384."
2021-05-24,"  Coinbase stock is the best way for investors to gain exposure to the crypto industry and avoid volatility, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Wall Street megabank Goldman Sachs has initiated coverage of United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase with a buy rating following a major crash on crypto markets.In a note to clients on Monday, Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance stated that Coinbase stock is the best way for investors to gain exposure to the crypto industry, CNBC reported. According to the report, shares of crypto companies like Coinbase should be regarded as a hedge against the parabolic volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).“While we believe the core business today offers an attractive growth profile with the potential to drive new high levels of profitability, we see significant white space for new initiatives to drive more stable and recurring revenue streams to complement the core trading business over the longer term,” the analysts reportedly wrote.In the buy rating for Coinbase shares, Goldman Sachs analysts set a 12-month price target of $306, implying a share price increase of 36%. However, Coinbase’s longer-term fate will depend on the continued success or failure of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, the client note reportedly reads.Following the newly initiated buy rating, shares of COIN rose nearly 3.5% to over $235 in premarket trading. The stock debuted on Nasdaq on April 14 at a price of $381. The price rebound comes in line with a notable uptick on crypto markets, with Bitcoin surging more than 4% over the past 24 hours to trade above $37,400. The latest buy rating is not the first time that Goldman Sachs mentioned Coinbase as a successful stock. In late April, Goldman Sachs mentioned Coinbase as one of 19 U.S. stocks performing significantly better than the S&P 500.Previous reports in December 2020 suggested that Coinbase was looking to Goldman Sachs to handle its public filing. The latest news comes shortly after Goldman Sachs reportedly launched Bitcoin derivatives trading to Wall Street executives in early May."
2021-05-23,"  Bitcoin is witnessing aggressive selling but if key support levels hold, ETH, ADA, SOL, and MATIC may lead the market higher. During strong uptrends, every correction is aggressively purchased as the sentiment is positive and traders expect higher levels in the future. Therefore, corrections during a bull phase are shallow and the trend reasserts itself quickly.However, when the trend changes from up to down, traders wait to sell on rallies because they believe lower levels are likely. In a bearish market, support levels are easily violated and the asset continues to slide.Generally, a downtrend that is followed after a roaring bull market does not end before a capitulation phase where most bulls have given up on the hope for a sharp recovery. After that happens, the asset class bottoms out.In the midst of all the volatility, traders should keep an eye on the fundamentals and the long-term story of cryptocurrencies. Instead of panicking, they should take an informed decision. Let’s look at the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may attempt a relief rally in the next few days.Bitcoin (BTC) dipped and closed below the 200-day simple moving average ($40,235) on May 19. Institutional investors watch this indicator closely and usually avoid buying if the price sustains below it for an extended duration.Buyers pushed the price back above the 200-day SMA on May 20 but they could not sustain the price above it. This shows that bears are selling on rallies. The BTC/USDT pair could now drop to $28,850. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the selling could intensify further with the next stop at $20,000.The downsloping 50-day SMA ($53,500) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the oversold zone suggest advantage to the bears.However, if the price rebounds off the $28,850 support, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the 200-day SMA. If they succeed, the pair could rise to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.The 4-hour chart shows the relief rallies to the downtrend line are being sold by the bears. This suggests the sentiment has turned negative and traders are viewing the pullbacks to overhead resistance levels as a shorting opportunity.The 50-SMA is sloping down and the RSI has been trading in the negative zone, indicating advantage to the bears. The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the downtrend line. Such a move could open the doors for a rally to $42,401 and then $46,000.Ether (ETH) broke below the 50-day SMA ($2,776) on May 19. The bulls tried to push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA on May 20 and 21 but failed. This shows that traders sold on rallies. If the price sustains below $1,801.60, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($1,578). This level is likely to act as strong support. If the price rebounds off it, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA where the bears are again likely to mount stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the pair may remain range-bound for a few days. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 200-day SMA, panic may set in and the pair could drop to $1,289.09.The 50-day SMA is flattening out and the RSI is approaching oversold levels, indicating the short-term trend is negative but the medium-term trend is neutral.The pair is trading inside a descending channel on the 4-hour chart and the moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, suggesting the short-term trend is negative. If the bears sink and sustain the price below the support line of the channel, the selling pressure could increase and the pair may drop to $1,289.09.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the support line of the channel, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the pair above the channel. If they succeed, it will suggest the downtrend could be over and the pair may rally to $3,000.Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the $0.95 level on May 19 and the bulls extended the relief rally on May 20 but higher levels attracted profit-booking and the price dipped back below the $1.48 support on May 22.The $1 to $0.95 level is likely to act as strong support on the downside. If the price rebounds off this support, the ADA/USDT pair could again try to move up to $1.48. The flattening 50-day SMA ($1.44) suggests a possible range-bound action.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the support zone, the pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($0.77). A strong rebound off this level will suggest the markets have rejected the lower levels. The bulls will then once again try to push the price above $1.If that happens, the pair may enter a consolidation. This view will invalidate if the pair breaks below the 200-day SMA.The 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart has started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating advantage to the bears. However, the bulls are likely to step in and buy the dips near the critical $1 support.If that happens, the pullback could reach the downtrend line, which is likely to act as stiff resistance. If the bulls drive the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rise to $1.48. This positive view will nullify if the pair breaks below the $1 to $0.95 support.Solana (SOL) broke below the 50-day SMA ($37) on May 19 but rebounded sharply on May 20. However, the long wick on the May 20 candlestick suggests traders booked profits at higher levels and bears initiated short positions. The selling picked up momentum on May 22 and the SOL/USDT pair broke below the 50-day SMA. The selling has continued today as the price dropped to the strong support at $21.10.If the price rebounds off this support, the pair could attempt to rise to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $35.48. A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will suggest the short-term trend could be tilting in favor of the bulls.Alternatively, if the price turns down from $35.48, the bears will again try to sink the price below $21.10. If they are successful, the pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($14.29). The 4-hour chart shows the moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating advantage to the bears. However, the RSI has slipped deep into the negative territory, suggesting the selling may be overextended in the short term.If the price rebounds off $21.10, the bulls will try to push the price above the downtrend line. If they manage to do that, the pair could attempt to rally to $35.48 and then to the 50-SMA. Conversely, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, it will increase the possibility of a break below $21.10.Polygon (MATIC) has witnessed a sharp decline since hitting the all-time high at $2.70 on May 18. The altcoin has given up all the gains that it had accrued since May 11 and dropped to the 50-day SMA ($0.78).The bulls are likely to defend the 50-day SMA and if the price rebounds off the support, the MATIC/USDT pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.53. A breakout of this resistance will be the first indication that the selling pressure may be reducing.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $1.53, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA. The flattish 50-day SMA and the RSI below 45 point to a possible consolidation in the short term.This view will invalidate if the bears pull the price below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the pair could drop to $0.68 and then to $0.54.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are attempting to stall the waterfall decline at $0.80. However, any rebound is likely to face stiff resistance at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from this resistance, the downtrend may extend to $0.68.The 50-SMA has started to turn down and the RSI is in the oversold territory, indicating advantage to the bears. This negative view will be negated if the price rebounds off the current levels and sustains above the downtrend line. Such a move could result in a relief rally to $1.53.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-23,"  Some of Bitcoin’s most influential holders bought the dip during last week’s market meltdown.  Large Bitcoin (BTC) holders appear to be aggressively buying the dip amid the latest price correction, raising optimism that the coordinated selloff could be about to end. Using data from Glassnode, Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony Pompliano recently concluded that the so-called Bitcoin whales — entities who hold between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC — purchased 122,588 BTC during the height of the market crash on Wednesday. Much of the foot traffic to crypto exchanges came from the United States, as evidenced by Coinbase’s $3,000 BTC premium at one point. Crypto hedge funds interviewed by Bloomberg have also reiterated that they were, in fact, dip buyers. MVPQ Capital and ByteTree Asset Management, both based in London, along with Singapore’s Three Arrows Capital, all bought the dip. Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, told Bloomberg:As Cointelegraph recently reported, at least one prominent whale, who sold BTC at a price of $58,000, has not only reaccumulated but added to their holdings. The unknown entity sold 3,000 BTC on May 9 before buying back 3,521 BTC in three separate trades on May 15, 18 and 19. The Bitcoin price languished below $32,000 on Sunday as traders continued to test the limits of a new bearish range. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly fell below $30,000 on Wednesday — a level that appeared highly unlikely to ever be penetrated again — before quickly shooting back up to $37,000. However, overhead resistance has limited BTC’s rally to no greater than $42,000. "
2021-05-23,"  Bitcoin price and altcoins take a series of heavy hits as the weekend sell-off deepens. Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency experienced another wave of overnight selling which deepened on May 23 as the majority of tokens pummeled to multi-month lows. The market-wide sell-off resulted in the total cryptocurrency market cap shedding another $250 billion in value to $1.33 trillion. The total market cap has now experienced a 46% pullback from the May 11 all-time high at $2.56 trillion, but the stunning turn of events has left the vast majority of traders scrambling to lock in any gains experienced during the run up. This newest wave of selling pressure managed to successfully break below the $36,000 support level, sending BTC price as low as $31,000. Ether (ETH) was hit with a 20% drawdown in price that smashed its value back below $2,000 for the second time in a week, marking a 56% decline in its price from its all-time high at $4,362 which was established just 11 days ago on May 12. While the magnitude of the Bitcoin pullbacks is starting to diminish following several weeks of price declines, the continued selling has hit the altcoin market hard with Sunday's price rout shaving at least 30% off a majority of the coins in the top 100 as capitulation set in for traders from around the globe. Polkadot (DOT) fell more than 40% to a low of $14 and Solana (SOL) shed 36% of its value to hit a low at $19.Polygon (MATIC), which reached an all-time high at $2.68 just 5 days ago, has now fallen 69% and trades below $0.84 at the time of writing. The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.285 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 46.9%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-05-23,"  The value of Ethereum is down 54% from its recent peak. Its combined market cap is now $226 billion, less than half of its all-time high.   Ethereum (ETH) and most major altcoins declined sharply on Sunday, extending a ten-day selloff that has knocked out more than $1 trillion in combined valuation from the market. Ether price dipped below $2,000 for only the second time since Apr. 7, reaching an intraday low of $1,870.00, according to TradingView data. Ether fell below the psychological threshold last week as Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped below $30,000. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was last seen languishing at $1,936, down nearly 16% on the day. The fall from grace puts Ether at a 54% discount compared with its all-time high near $4,200 earlier this month.Bitcoin continues to exert a gravitational pull on the broader cryptocurrency market. A coordinated selloff of BTC over the past week has put a damper on market sentiment, dragging the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to “Extreme Fear.” As Cointelegraph recently reported, Bitcoin’s price fell below $34,000 on Sunday. Some analysts foresaw ETH’s large decline after a massive inflow of the digital currency made its way onto exchanges, signaling that whales were preparing to sell.Looking beyond the charts, the Ethereum Foundation recently disclosed that it had fixed a “severe threat” against the smart contract platform after implementing the Berlin hard fork last month. The threat left the Ethereum network highly vulnerable to “malicious transactions,” Martin Holst Swende and Peter Szilagyi wrote on May 18. After the issue was fixed, the Foundation disclosed the vulnerability “in the interest of transparency.” Market optimism surrounding Ethereum has been high for much of 2021, as investors and users look ahead to the highly anticipated EIP-1559 upgrade. The proposed upgrade, which will be part of the London hard fork slated for July, intends to change Ethereum’s fee structure and remove much of the uncertainty around gas costs. "
2021-05-23,"  The price of Bitcoin dropped below $34,000 as traders look to the next levels of support. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $34,000 on major exchanges including Binance as the cryptocurrency market's corrective phase continues.Large inflows of Ether (ETH) into exchanges were spotted before the latest downturn, suggesting that ETH whales might have led the most recent sell-off in the market.In the near term, the major macro level for Bitcoin and Ether remain at $30,000 and $2,000, respectively.According to traders like TraderKoz, if Bitcoin can remain above $37,000 throughout the weekend and recover to around $37,500, the chances of overtaking $42,000 become high.The $42,000 level is currently the major resistance area, and rallying above that would increase the chances of a newfound rally.However, if Bitcoin remains below $37,000, the likelihood of a range between $30,000 and $35,000 would increase sharply in the short term.Referring $37,000 as the ""midrange"" for Bitcoin, TraderKoz wrote:Eugene Ng, the head of business development in Asia at Gemini said that systematic algorithms turned short and during the weekend, Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to see bigger drops to previous lows.He said:The market has been weaker than many traders expected, as technical analysts anticipated consolidation until the U.S. and London markets opened on Monday.It is crucial for Bitcoin to retain the $33,000 support level to avoid another test of the $30,000 support area in the near termOn May 21, analysts at Whalemap identified $39,931 as a large whale cluster after spotting inflows of around 115,000 BTC.Hence, to recap, $33,000 and $35,000 remains crucial support levels in the near future, while $39,931 and $42,000 are the major resistance levels.But, one silver lining in the market is that Bitcoin miners are currently not selling, according to trader Lex Moskovoski.He wrote:"
2021-05-22,"  As the crypto market plunge takes its toll on Bitcoin profits, some traders are using strategies based on sentiment and trading data to secure outsized gains. Bitcoin may be suffering through a succession of negative news stories, but some crypto investors are still celebrating major gains in 2021’s altcoin bull market.Since January 3 this year, Cointelegraph Markets Pro has been live-testing 42 separate automated strategies based on the proprietary VORTECS™ algorithm developed in partnership with The TIE, a data analytics firm.Let’s not be humble about this: VORTECS™ has crushed it.Of those 42 strategies, every single one has beaten the return on investment (ROI) delivered by Bitcoin for hodlers who refuse to part with their BTC. And even when compared to holding an evenly-weighted basket of the top 100 altcoins, 88% of those strategies come out ahead.What’s more, the most successful strategies — whether based on the time between an entry position and a hypothetical exit, or exiting a position based on crossing a new score threshold — have delivered in excess of 2,000% returns as of May 22 — even after multiple pullbacks in the crypto asset class. In fact, the most successful of all (Buy 80 / Sell 80) has generated returns of 2,150%.That compares extremely favorably with the strategy of holding Bitcoin (10% ROI) or the basket of altcoins (226% ROI) since January 3.In the chart above, which is based on exiting a position at an arbitrary time (24 hours, 48 hours, 96 hours or 168 hours) all VORTECS™ strategies beat Bitcoin... and only one failed to beat the altcoin basket.In this second chart, based on exiting at a second score threshold, all VORTECS™ strategies beat holding Bitcoin, and only four failed to beat the altcoin basket.So what is VORTECS™ — and why is it consistently outperforming the wider crypto market?The VORTECS™ Score is an algorithmic metric derived from historical analysis of crypto markets.For each one of the ~200 crypto assets supported by Cointelegraph Markets Pro, the algorithm is hunting for moments in time that resemble the current marketscape — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Specifically, it’s looking for patterns that have consistently led to significant changes in price in the past.Those patterns include a variety of factors: Volume, Outlook, RealPrice, Tweet Volume, Elevation, Confidence, and Sentiment... or VORTECS™ for short.Volume: A measure of how much of an asset is traded across supported exchanges.Outlook: A measure of whether the current market conditions are favorable or not, compared with historically-similar conditions.RealPrice: A composite price derived from an average of prices across relevant exchanges, discounting outliers based on low volume.Tweet Volume: A measure of the absolute and relative number of tweets about an asset over the past 24 hours.Elevation: A measure of how far up or down an asset’s price moved following historically-similar market conditions to those observed currently.Confidence: The degree to which current conditions are similar to historic conditions, with higher confidence also including the consistency of asset price moves following those conditions.Sentiment: The positivity or negativity of the chatter on Twitter surrounding the crypto asset, derived from a complex proprietary algorithm developed by The TIE.The algorithm combines all of this raw data into a VORTECS™ Score, which is designed to identify the general health of the market for a particular crypto asset. A high score suggests that in the past, conditions similar to those we see right now have often led to increases in the price of that asset. The higher the score, the more confident the algorithm is that these scenarios have been consistent.Like any trading algorithm, that doesn’t mean it’s a crystal ball — in fact, it’s almost exactly the opposite. Whereas fortune tellers look into the future, VORTECS™ looks into the past. But it turns out that examining the right elements of history provides keen insights for crypto traders who are seeking an edge.Cointelegraph Markets Pro testing tracks the price of an asset when the score crosses a threshold (for example, a score of 85) and then measures the price again when it crosses a second threshold (which could be another score, or could be measured in hours). The difference between the first and second prices is the gain or loss that the algorithm tracks… and there’s more detail on that here.So even though a human couldn’t trade exactly this way, by applying a consistent set of standards it’s possible to establish whether an algorithm is operationally successful or not. And the verdict is very clear: VORTECS™ has consistently and significantly outperformed the crypto market as a whole since live-testing began earlier this year.And perhaps just as importantly is the fact that even with a major pullback in the overall value of the crypto markets, which lost close to a trillion dollars in value at the low point this week, the performance of all the VORTECS™ strategies tested continued to outperform the benchmark currency, Bitcoin, by a significant margin.Remember, the score is not a prediction of how an asset price WILL change over time, but an analysis of how asset prices HAVE changed over time when faced with similar market conditions.So the VORTECS™ Score, while it is weighted to take account of the size of asset price change in the past, will not tell you HOW MUCH an asset may change.It will also not tell you WHEN it will change — in fact, the algorithm is deliberately fuzzy on time, meaning that it is normalized and smoothed to ensure that abrupt outliers (such as a sudden viral tweet) don’t abnormally affect the overall trend.While the algorithm is generally oriented to a 12-72 hour timeframe, testing revealed that efforts to “time the market” precisely introduced an element that was not supported by historical data.So let’s take a look at an example score of 85.This is a high score which means that there is some combination of these factors:The 1,500+ crypto traders in the Cointelegraph Markets Pro Discord group, which is available exclusively to members, have used these scores in a wide variety of ways to enhance their understanding of the current market health for dozens of crypto assets.And while massive ROI numbers like 2,150% are at the extremes of VORTECS™ success, it is worth noting that the mean ROI from all score-based strategies is 642%, while the mean ROI from all time-based strategies is 638%... both of which are significantly higher than the benchmarks set by BTC (10%) and altcoins (226%).Cointelegraph Markets Pro is available exclusively to members on a monthly basis at $99 per month, or annually with two free months included.

2021-05-22,"  Bitcoin was designed as a deflationary system, one that could help it reach ever-increasing values. This is Part One of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question: What is the “fundamental value” of Bitcoin? Part One is about the value of scarcity, Part Two — the market moves in bubbles, Part Three — the rate of adoption, and Part Four — the hash rate and the estimated price of Bitcoin.In recent months — and throughout 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects on the economy — central banks around the world have issued unprecedented quantities of money in order to try to counter an inevitable economic crisis. We live in a world where each generation of newly issued money, printed by central banks, leads to inflation, or the reduction of the purchase value of the currency itself and consequently, an increase in the price of goods.To give an example, last year alone the amount of U.S. dollars printed equals almost 20% of all dollars generated throughout time, based on the registered value of the money supply of dollars in the world. 20% in a single year is absurd, only made possible by breaking the pact that obligates governments to keep the dollar quantity in circulation linked to the quantity of gold in the central bank’s vaults (the famous 1971 Bretton Woods Pact).Consequently, the more dollars that are printed, the more we can see their worth decreasing over time. The opposite of inflation is deflation — in other words, as time passes, the more a currency appreciates and its purchasing power grows.It is important to understand that Bitcoin (BTC) was designed to grow in value indefinitely. I say this because the smallest quantity, known as a satoshi, is equal to 0.00000001 Bitcoin. It’s obvious that its creator imagined a deflationary system for his creation, one that could help it reach ever-increasing values. In the moment that a satoshi has grown to be worth a U.S. dollar, a Bitcoin will equal $100,000,000. This is the value that Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind for his own Bitcoin.Not immediately, obviously, and not even in the short term. The path will likely be long and paved with several bubble bursts. Only the most courageous and tenacious who resist will succeed in the enterprise. But alas, this is the story of the financial markets.Because there are 7 billion people in the world, and there can only be 21 million Bitcoin circulating at the end of its generation cycle. As of 2020, it is estimated that around 20 million people worldwide have more than a million dollars of wealth — do you think there is enough Bitcoin for all these rich people? Many of them won’t be able to own a whole Bitcoin because getting one will cost too much in a few years, and because those who own them would never think about selling them. This is the phenomenon of scarcity. Whereas we are used to inflation, or the increasing amount of money being printed by central banks, this doesn’t exist in the crypto world. In some cases, there are special cryptocurrencies that are designed to decrease the number of tokens in circulation over time.Scarcity, coupled with an increasing circulation of cryptocurrencies, is the main reason why the price tends to rise and will continue to do so over time. You understand now that owning an entire Bitcoin will be a luxury that only a few people will be able to afford, at most a few million people — given that the first million is rumored to be firmly deposited in Satoshi's wallets.Related: 4 reasons why the top 15 richest Bitcoin wallets still matter in 2021This is the most concrete possibility we know of in terms of getting rich fast, in a relatively short amount of years. Still, for a small group of people the scenario of becoming millionaires thanks to cryptocurrencies (about 100,000 in the world) has already happened.The concept of scarcity is well present and known in commodities, such as with gold, silver, palladium or platinum. These precious materials are all the more precious the more scarce their production is. But is there a mathematical model that can estimate what the correct value of goods should be, based on its scarcity?If we think about phenomena such as Ferrari, Rolex, ancient paintings by famous painters, etc... all these assets are valued significantly higher than their cost of realization due to their scarcity — induced or generated — by those who created the assets themselves, just like Bitcoin. In fact, there is a mathematical model known as stock-to-flow, or SF, that estimates price based on the quantity already present in the world (stock) with the quantity that is extracted every year (flow).The smaller the quantity extracted every year, the higher the value the precious metal has. And since it takes many years to double the stock currently in circulation, it itself has value because it is scarce.In this table, SF is measured as years required for the current stock to double. As you can see, gold is extracted at an amount of 1.8% per year compared with the current stock, so its total value is greater than the other commodities.This relationship is more evident if the relationship between market value and supply growth is applied to a power diagram (Cartesian plane with both axes using a logarithmic scale).From this graph, you can clearly see that there is a power law governing the scarcity of goods along with their overall market value. The power law is deduced by how linear the existing relationship manifests on a Cartesian plane with both logarithmic axes, as shown in the previous figure.Does this law also apply to Bitcoin, designed to have an ever-increasing stock-to-flow ratio? (i.e., an ever-decreasing number of Bitcoin mined over time).From the graph, it is clear that even Bitcoin, albeit with a different scale, follows the same power law.The three breaks in the graph represent the three halvings, a phenomenon of halving mined Bitcoin that occurs approximately every four years, which makes Bitcoin increasingly scarce compared with the stock in circulation.From this graph, we can see that the value of $20 trillion is anything but impossible to achieve, and indeed, it is only a matter of time — once the percentage of Bitcoin mined in a single year will be equal to or less than 1%, a situation that will occur at the next halving in 2024.This article was co-authored by Ruggero Bertelli and Daniele Bernardi.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2021-05-22,"  Persistent struggles with high fees and network congestion have allowed layer-one solutions like Polkadot, Solana and Cosmos to become established competitors. In bull and bear markets, wise cryptocurrency investors know that the primary focus should be on project longevity rather than jumping on every short-term price movement. As the crypto ecosystem expands and new sectors arise, protocols that offer the most value to the community stand the best chance at long-term survival and price appreciation.The goal of this newsletter is to take a more thematic, macro view of niche sub-sectors within the cryptocurrency market and identify projects whose signal they will be successful within the space. It isn’t about the token price; it’s about the tech, the fundamentals of the project, and how each one must help push the sector forward to the next level.In a recent conversation with Cointelegraph, Élie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, said: “Sector trends and crypto are big and are here to stay, but idiosyncratic risk must be taken into account while weighing portfolios.”According to Le Rest, the “crypto market tends to work on comparable principles,” which is a repeating trend seen multiple times in its history. With that said, let’s take a deeper dive into the current market cycle rotation taking place in the wider crypto market to get a better grasp on where new money and participants coming into the market are beginning to focus their attention. Layer-one is a term used to describe the main underlying blockchain architecture of a network, while layer-two solutions are protocols that operate on top of the underlying L1 blockchain and cannot function without the framework that they provide. Bitcoin is by far the dominant L1 solution in terms of value, while the Ethereum network has been fundamental in reshaping the crypto market landscape over the past few years thanks to smart contracts and the rise of sectors such as decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens.While Ethereum has received a majority of the attention when it comes to discussions about smart contract platforms, several projects have been rising in prominence of late as high fees and a low transaction-per-second count on the Ethereum network have enticed projects to build on up-and-coming networks. Ethereum’s success has demonstrated to the world the capabilities of smart contract platforms, but its continued struggles have opened the door for protocols like Polkadot, Solana and Cosmos, which offer a similar value proposition along with solutions to the underlying problems mentioned, to grow in terms of price and relevance over the past year. Polkadot has become one of the most well-known and successful L1 projects in the crypto space besides Ethereum in 2021 thanks in large part to the project’s approach of interoperability and cooperation as opposed to the previous “Ethereum killer” approach taken by many. Created in part by Gavin Wood, who also played an instrumental role in the creation of Ethereum, the Polkadot network has taken a more complementary approach as an open-source sharding multichain protocol that enables cross-chain bridges so that projects and developers can choose the network that best suits their needs and easily transfer their protocols if necessary. Not limited to just tokens, Polkadot’s multi-chain functionality enables the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, helping to establish a wide range of interoperability between separate blockchain networks. Polkadot’s ecosystem is one of the largest and most active in the space, with a rapidly expanding list of projects launching on the protocol and looking to obtain one of the limited parachain slots in the upcoming parachain auctions. As seen in the graphic above, the Polkadot ecosystem has rapidly expanded to incorporate the major sectors of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including DeFi platforms, nonfungible token protocols, oracles and decentralized autonomous organizations. The network also has a growing list of applications that facilitate interacting with the protocol, including a wide range of wallets that support Polkadot’s DOT and Polkadot-based assets, as well as multiple network explorers, including Polkascan.Popular projects that are currently operating on the Polkadot testnet and are favored to win a parachain slot include DeFi ecosystem Acala Network and the Polkaswap decentralized exchange, which are both available now for testing and can be accessed using the Polkadot-js wallet browser extension. Once the parachain auctions are finished and the projects go live on Polkadot, the network’s launch will officially be complete. While there is no definitive date yet set for when the parachain auctions will begin, excitement for DOT has continued to build, which has translated into its price increasing more than 800% in 2021. With the prospect of full network capabilities set to launch within a period of weeks to months and mainstream attention beginning to arrive, many investors feel that Polkadot is well-positioned to see further growth in price and adoption as a key player in the future of interoperability across blockchain networks. Solana is a fast, secure and censorship-resistant blockchain network that “provides the open infrastructure required for global adoption,” according to the project’s website. The project’s connection with the FTX cryptocurrency exchange and its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who also had a hand in the creation and operation of the Serum decentralized exchange, which operates on the Solana network, has been beneficial for the protocol in terms of financial backing and media exposure. Aside from those positive associations, the underlying technology of the Solana network has attracted the attention of a wide range of projects interested in launching or bridging to its high-speed, low-cost environment. The rapid expansion of the Solana ecosystem over the past year began with a focus on decentralized finance and has been bolstered by the success of the Serum, which users can interface with using several wallets that support Solana, including Sollet, Ledger and Math Wallet.While a majority of the tools and supporting infrastructure on the network have been geared toward DeFi, recent additions to the network, such as the decentralized music-sharing and streaming protocol Audius, show that the protocol is beginning to branch out and attract the attention of other types of projects interested in its capabilities. The Solana protocol utilizes an innovative hybrid model consisting of a proof-of-history consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake consensus of the blockchain to increase the network’s overall scalability. More recently, the network has seen a number of new projects launch that have employed some of the same tactics that drummed up activity and enthusiasm on the Ethereum network in 2017, including airdrops and copycat projects. While some may see this as a negative, it demonstrates the increased adoption and allure of a low-cost environment as well as showing that Solana is a developer-friendly network. These influences, combined with a multitude of other factors, have helped boost the price of Solana (SOL) by more than 3,200% so far in 2021.Given that DeFi and other hot sectors of the cryptocurrency sector still in their infancy, Solana is well equipped to see its ecosystem expand and token value increase as global cryptocurrency adoption increases. Cosmos refers to itself as “the internet of blockchains” consisting of “an ever-expanding ecosystem of interconnected apps and services, built for a decentralized future.”The network arose out of the Tendermint project, which is considered “the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem” and launched via a token sale in 2017. The protocol utilizes a PoS consensus algorithm that allows token holders to stake their coins to help keep the project’s flagship blockchain Cosmos Hub secure, while also earning a yield that is paid out in Cosmos (ATOM) tokens. Momentum for the project in 2021 was kicked up a notch in February following the Stargate update, which included the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, an interoperability layer for Cosmos blockchains.The IBC allows projects built with the Cosmos software development kit, like Kava and Band Protocol, to easily interoperate and bridge tokens across other blockchains on the Cosmos network, which currently hosts more than 240 apps and services. The capabilities of the IBC will eventually connect with other blockchain networks, such as the Binance Smart Chain, helping to increase interoperability across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With a transaction speed of 7 seconds and an average fee of $0.01, transacting on the Cosmos network is a welcome experience for users fleeing high fees on Ethereum. The May 10 completion of the Gravity decentralized exchange testnet trading competition shows the protocol is gearing up to offer solutions similar to Uniswap for a fraction of the fees, hinting at a promising future for this growing ecosystem. Growing ecosystems and the planned development and integration of interoperability features are strong indicators of longevity for layer-one projects in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency space.Potential threats to the success of L1 solutions include projects, such as Polygon and Fantom, which provide cross-chain bridges to other more capable networks and L2 solutions that eliminate the scaling issues that plague the Ethereum network.While these threats are real, each network or protocol will eventually run into its own unique set of challenges that hamper its capabilities and open the door for competitors to offer a better solution. Ethereum introduced the world to smart contracts and expanded the scope of what could be done on L1 solutions beyond what was previously achievable on Bitcoin. Limitations in the original and current design of the Ethereum network have opened the door for newer L1 solutions like Polkadot, Solana and Cosmos to establish themselves as viable contenders thanks to faster transaction times and an already-established proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

2021-05-21,"  Another round of FUD helped to push Bitcoin price back below $34,000, placing further pressure on altcoins which now trade below multi-month lows.  On May 21 the crypto market was hit with a fresh round of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) which sparked another, albeit more muted, sell-off in Bitcoin (BTC) price and a majority of the altcoins. For the second time in less than 3-weeks, China was again the culprit as rumors that regulators were looking to crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading. Media also reported that authorities in Hong Kong proposed banning retail traders from cryptocurrency trading.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Bitcoin (BTC) bulls were holding the $40,000 support level prior to the announcement from China but quickly lost it and had to regroup at the $36,000 support before further downside ensued.While the turnaround seen across the market on Thursday helped assuage fears of the return to a crypto winter, some analysts, including Jarvis Labs co-founder Ben Lilly, correctly assessed that “we are not out of the woods” prior to Friday’s drawdown. Still, there is room for hope that the price of BTC could manage to hold its ground and climb higher as activity seen in whale wallets showed heavy inflows at $39,931, indicating a new possible level of support. Significant inflows to whale wallet happened at $39,931 (around 115k BTC). This should now be a support for #Bitcoin. Closest resistances are at 52 and 56k. pic.twitter.com/XnsNQ35BFZCryptocurrency exchanges played a big part in Wednesday’s price action as highlighted in the recent Delphi Daily report by Ashwath Balakrishnan. According to Balakrishnan, Binance was responsible for:This marked the “single highest day of volume for all DEXes” on record led by Uniswap (UNI) which saw “nearly $6 billion of volume” transacted as retail traders ran for the exits. According to Micah Spruill, managing partner and chief investment officer at S2F Capital, approximately $9 billion in value was liquidated during this week’s correction in a similar washout to what was experienced in March 2020. Spruill also pointed to the “historic levels of Bitcoin being moved off the exchange on May 19 when compared to the net exchange outflows over the last several years,” highlighting the fact that this was the highest dollar denominated amount of net outflows in history and is “extremely bullish.”To get a better grasp on the current sentiment of traders in the market, Spruill pointed out that retail wallets have continued to grow in numbers despite the market turmoil with the dip being quickly bought by retail investors, which is “a sign of continued growth and adoption.”Spruill said:The continued pressure on Bitcoin spilled over into the altcoin market causing the majority of tokens in the top 100 to drop deeper into the red.  The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.4 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 44.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-05-21,"  Derivatives data shows whales aggressively bought the dip as Bitcoin's price dropped below $36,000, but that doesn't mean BTC has bottomed yet. The stream of negative regulatory news concerning Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies has been nonstop over the past couple of weeks. Today's FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — news that failed to cite any actions and merely refreshes old information from China. A statement from the Chinese government revealed plans to ""crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior."" While retail traders are easily scared by this type of news, whales and market makers know how to spot a buying opportunity, which was the case for today's drop to $36,200.The Chinese Financial Stability and Development Committee minutes presented general guidelines on multiple issues, including reforming mid-sized financial institutions and cracking down on illegal securities activities. Therefore, it was neither a targeted attack on Bitcoin nor did it differ from the actions and discourse from previous years.On May 18, trade associations under the People's Bank of China warned financial institutions and other member organizations to not engage in crypto business transactions.However, crypto trading in China has been banned since September 2017, and concerns regarding the carbon emissions of Bitcoin mining operations were expressed over three weeks ago by Chinese state media outlet PengPai.Even market-making platforms have been targeted by Chinese authorities since 2018. Some crypto trading sites continued to operate illegally in the country, but most were identified and shut down by authorities in 2019.Exchange-provided data highlights traders' long-to-short net positioning. By analyzing every client's position on the perpetual and futures contracts, one can obtain a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.Whales and market makers on OKEx reached a 1.08 long-to-short ratio in the early hours of May 21, favoring longs by 8%. It is worth noting that this level was the lowest in 30 days, indicating a lack of conviction. However, these pro traders entered bullish positions over the day as Bitcoin retraced below $37,000, favoring longs by 62%.Trading volume is the best indicator to confirm whale activity, and those peaks need to coincide with price bottoms. Even though every trade has a buyer and a seller, extreme volatility can occur on low trading volumes, therefore not necessarily involving pro traders.By looking at the above data, there should be no doubt that whales and market makers aggressively bought the $36,200 dip on May 21. Spot exchange volumes surpassed $5.6 billion in four hours, which is extreme even for a 12% price movement.To put things in perspective, the daily average volume over the past month stands at $11 billion. Therefore, by combining this data with derivatives exchanges' long-to-short ratio, one should assume that some heavy players were brave enough to buy today's dip.Although no one can precisely forecast whether $35,200 will hold over the weekend, one should expect those heavy hands to maintain their position for a very long time.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-21,"  Bitcoin’s failure to extend its recovery shows supply exceeds demand at higher levels and this could put a cap on the bounce in altcoins.  After Bitcoin’s (BTC) capitulation on May 19 and the pullback on May 20, the next big question on everyone's mind is whether the correction is over or will the downtrend resume. Let’s study the supply and demand picture to gain more insight.Chainalysis chief economist Philip Gradwell pointed out that whales who had purchased more than 1,000 Bitcoin after 2017 added 34,000 Bitcoin to their holdings on May 18 and 19. This suggests the whales bought during the crypto meltdown.Additional on-chain data also suggests that the huge spike in over-the-counter Bitcoin outflow is a signal of accumulation by institutions or high net worth individuals.Although institutional investors may be buying, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said in an interview with CNN on May 18 that the crypto sector was in a bubble. Being non-committal, Buterin said that the bubble may have already burst or could do so after a few months.Guggenheim CIO Scott Minerd who till recently was projecting a $600,000 target on Bitcoin, did a ‘U turn’ on his opinion and termed crypto as “Tulipmania.” This shows how some newer crypto investors flip their views on every minor dip.The market participants seem to be divided on the next possible move. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance.Bitcoin’s long tail on the May 19 candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively bought the drop to $29,257.95. The buyers continued their purchases on May 20 but the price has reversed direction from $42,217.17 today. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($47,964) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the oversold territory suggest the bears are in command. Even if the price rises above $42,500, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to face resistance at the neckline and then at the 20-day EMA.If the price breaks below $35,000, the pair could drop to $28,850. A strong rebound off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels and may result in a consolidation. A breakout and close above $51,538 will signal advantage to the bulls while a break below $28,850 may start the next leg of the down move that could reach $20,000.Ether’s (ETH) rebound off the $1,801.60 level on May 19 is facing stiff resistance at the 50-day simple moving average ($2,779). This suggests that bears are trying to flip the 50-day SMA into resistance. The 20-day EMA ($3,201) has turned down and the RSI has dropped below 40, indicating that bears have the upper hand. If the sellers can sink the price below $2,145, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to $1,801.60. A break below this support may pull the price down to $1,547.46 and then $1,289.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above $3,000, the bulls may challenge the 20-day EMA. A breakout and close above $3,450 will suggest the downtrend has ended.Binance Coin’s (BNB) pullback from the $280 low on May 19 has hit a wall at $428. This suggests the selling may not be over yet and the bears will make one more attempt to resume the downtrend. The bearish crossover on the moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the bears are in control. If the bears sustain the price below $348.70, the BNB/USDT pair could again drop to $280. A break below this support could aggravate selling and pull the price down to $233.81.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $348.70, it will indicate that traders are not waiting for a deep correction to buy. That will increase the possibility of a break above $428. If that happens, the pair may rally to $480 where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.Cardano’s (ADA) long tail on the May 19 candlestick shows the bulls aggressively purchased the drop to $0.95. The buyers continued the recovery on May 20 and pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.71), indicating strength.However, the bears have not given up yet. They are again trying to sink the price below the $1.48 support. If the price rebounds off this support, the ADA/USDT pair may consolidate between $1.48 and $1.94 for a few days.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the bears if the price breaks and closes below the 50-day SMA ($1.44). Such a move could open the gates for a drop to $1.On the other hand, if the buyers drive the price above $1.94, it will suggest the correction is over. The pair could then retest the all-time high at $2.34.Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded off the $0.21 support on May 19 and the bulls managed to sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.31). They again successfully defended the 50-day SMA on May 20.If buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the DOGE/USDT pair could rally to $0.47. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.47 and $0.30 for a few days.The 20-day EMA ($0.44) has started to slope down marginally and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a minor advantage to the bears.A break and close below $0.30 could result in a drop to $0.21. Conversely, a breakout and close above $0.47 could open the doors for a move to $0.57. The bulls managed to defend the $0.88 level for the past two days, indicating demand at lower levels. However, if the bulls do not push the price above the moving averages quickly, XRP could once again slide down to $0.88.A breakdown and close below this support will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That may extend the downtrend to the next support at $0.56. The moving averages on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative zone, suggesting the bears are in control.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off $0.88, the XRP/USDT pair may rise to $1.26 and consolidate between these two levels for the next few days. The bulls will have to push and close the price above $1.70 to gain the upper hand.Polkadot (DOT) closed below the $26.50 to $44 range on May 19 but the bulls managed to push the price back into the range on May 20. However, the bulls have failed to sustain the price above $26.50, indicating selling on rallies.If the bears sink the DOT/USDT pair below $21.20, a retest of $18 will be on the cards. A breakdown and close below this critical support could indicate the start of a new downtrend. The 20-day EMA ($36) has turned down and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting the bears are in the driver’s seat.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price back above $26.50. Such a move will suggest strong buying on dips. A breakout and close above $31.28 may start the pair’s journey toward the 20-day EMA. That will enhance the prospects of the pair remaining inside the range for a few more days.The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could not even reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $918.58, which suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1,054) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate advantage to the bears. If the price breaks below $686.75, the BCH/USDT pair could retest the panic low at $473.84. A break below the $473.84 to $442.96 support zone could pull the price down to $370. On the contrary, if the pair turns up from the current level or from $473.83, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. A breakout and close above the $940 resistance will be the first indication of strength. The negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA.Litecoin’s (LTC) pullback is facing stiff resistance near the support line of the wedge. This suggests the bears are attempting to flip this level into resistance. If they succeed, the altcoin may resume its downtrend.If the bears sink the price below $166.56, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to $143.57. A strong rebound off this level may lead to a few days of consolidation with the boundaries at $143.57 and $224.85.If the bulls push and sustain the price above $224.85, the pair may rally to the 20-day EMA ($277), which is likely to act as stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level, the pair may drop to the support line of the wedge. A strong rebound off this support will be the first indication that the downtrend may be over.Uniswap’s (UNI) recovery on May 20 hit a wall just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $27.07. The altcoin has turned down today as the bears try to cement their advantageThe moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is near the oversold territory, which suggests the bears have the upper hand.A close below $22.50 will be the first sign of weakness and that may result in a retest of the $17.50 to $16 support zone. A strong bounce off this zone will indicate buying at lower levels and could be followed by a few days of range-bound action.Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $27.07, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the 20-day EMA ($33.82).

2021-05-21,"  The CEO of Unstoppable Domains notes data showing increased crypto interest despite the recent crypto market price drops.  Crypto asset prices fell drastically this past week. The CEO and co-founder of Unstoppable Domains, Matthew Gould, said interest in the industry, however, still remains positive. ""Over the past week, crypto markets have experienced significant volatility sparking concern among the blockchain community and investors at large,” Gould said in a comment sent to Cointelegraph. On Wednesday, Bitcoin plunged down near the $30,000 price point — a dramatic move considering the asset traded near $60,000 earlier in May, based on TradingView data. “However, blockchain domain names are being registered at unprecedented speeds with no signs of slowing down,” Gould said, adding:Unstoppable Domains gives folks the opportunity to acquire and control a given domain name with the .crypto extension, storable via a nonfungible token, or NFT. This differs from current standard centralized methods of website ownership, which domain providers control.Last week yielded headlines around Bitcoin mining energy consumption, stemming from Tesla’s decision to stop taking Bitcoin as a form of payment, based on related energy concerns. The move, seemingly temporary, has seen pushback from folks in the days since. "
2021-05-21,"  The best efforts of mainstream media to spark another price crash fail as BTC/USD rebounds after a mere 10% drop. Bitcoin (BTC) saw a fresh price dip on May 21 amid reports that China had reiterated its pledge to crack down on mining and trading.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC/USD shed 10% in minutes on May 21 as mainstream media turned up the volume on familiar bad news.The pair had recently regained $42,000 after a record-breaking recovery from a $30,000 dip on May 19, with the latest concerns erasing some of its progress.These focused on a Chinese government statement that revealed plans to ""crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior, and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risk.""As Cointelegraph reported, China had already reiterated its plans to control cryptocurrency activities within its jurisdiction, but media sources had taken comments from officials as a threat to the industry. With no official changes in policy coming on May 21 either, commentators were likewise quick to lay the blame on those spreading bad publicity.China bans banks from doing business in #bitcoin. http://t.co/KLU7MWq4g1""Let China actually ban Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining,"" popular commentator WhalePanda responded. Research previously showed that the Bitcoin network is resilient to changes in conditions, with a loss of mining power in one location soon compensated elsewhere.In a separate development, regulators in Hong Kong are planning to ban retail trading of cryptocurrency — with an exception for millionaires.As of the time of publication, Bitcoin was already rebounding from local lows of $36,680. More broadly, the impact of negative news slowed following the $30,000 dip, potentially due to the market now being cleansed of overleveraged traders.A tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on May 20 further criticizing Bitcoin's energy consumption likewise failed to cause the same shock as the first tweet last week.""Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale,"" he claimed.Meanwhile, popular Twitter account Documenting Bitcoin became the latest to highlight the uncanny bullish consequences of Chinese FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — surrounding Bitcoin. BTC/USD tends to see its biggest gains in the period following a round of doomsday noises from Beijing."
2021-05-21,"  Not everyone is bearish after Bitcoin price dropped from $40,000 to $30,000 and went back up again.  May 19's price crash in the Bitcoin (BTC) spot market wiped about $7.56 billion worth of long-leveraged positions from cryptocurrency derivatives markets.The event marked the biggest bullish leverage wipeout since March 2020. Retail and institutional investors borrowed from leading exchanges to amplify their potential returns. But a sudden reversal in Bitcoin spot rates, reportedly led by Elon Musk's anti-Bitcoin tweets over the weekend and fueled by China's reiteration of a ban on crypto transactions, blew up bulls' leverage ratios. That led to a so-called liquidity cascade in the derivatives market.In traditional markets, investors use cash as collateral to back their leveraged bets, but the cryptocurrency industry enables Bitcoin-backed collateral. So, when BTC prices fall, their downside move catches bullish traders — ones with leveraged positions on higher BTC prices — on the wrong foot.The event led many analysts to simmer down their bullish bias in the Bitcoin market, with Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, referring to crypto as ""Tulipmania."" Earlier, the Wall Street executive had called for a $600,000 price target for Bitcoin.But the mind-boggling long liquidation event has not made everyone bearish. On the contrary, some analysts have highlighted the wipeout as a catalyst for the next big bullish setup in the Bitcoin market.For instance, pseudonymous trader ""Twitterati CL207"" posted a long thread on Twitter explaining why he thinks a drop in open interest has made Bitcoin stronger in the long run.Twitterati CL207 highlighted the role of market makers in running a cryptocurrency derivatives platform. The analyst explained how their strategies assisted in transferring Bitcoin from weaker hands to stronger hands during the May 19 dip.In retrospect, the Bitcoin futures market is typically excessively long. That prompts market makers to gain exposure on the other side of the bullish trades. So, they open short positions.But that does not necessarily make the liquidity providers bearish. They prefer to back up their short positions by hedging in spot markets by purchasing BTC or other bullish derivatives exposure (options, futures, perpetual swaps, etc.)""Sometimes,"" said Twitterati CL207, ""there's hedge/short demand hitting the market maker too so that the market maker can sell their shorts back to them, but generally in crypto, its long-biased, and thus market maker holds [the] spot as collateral to their shorts.""The analyst added that market makers buy spot coins against high leverage demand from bulls, noting that leveraged long position holders are ""the weakest possible hands"" — most vulnerable to liquidations should the spot Bitcoin rate turn lower. When the long liquidation occurs, market makers close their shorts against them to provide liquidity. They also sell their spot positions to remain neutral.6/7and during a long liquidation heavy move, the MM constantly get hit by longs closing, so now they have to close their shorts against them (to provide liquidity) while selling spot (to remain neutral) to unwind this entire processThe trader explained what happened on May 19 when roughly $5 billion worth of long positions was liquidated as Bitcoin's price fell from nearly $40,000 to $30,000 within three hours. But then, the BTC/USD exchange rate quickly recovered back to $40,000.At the same time, the Bitcoin futures open interest did not follow the spot price recovery.""This means we just had the most significant weak hands to strong hands transfer in probably since March 12, 2020,"" noted Twitterati CL207, adding that strong hands with real cash bought BTC on the cheap from market makers. He said:Meanwhile, analyst Willy Woo wrote in his latest newsletter that long-term prospects in the Bitcoin market remain healthy, reiterating what fellow trader Twitterati CL207 highlighted in his Twitter thread: that the coins are going into the pockets of long-term investors.A long-term investor in the Bitcoin market, or a ""hodler,"" is typically an entity that sees the cryptocurrency as a hedge against fiat currencies. Capital injection policies undertaken by Western central banks to cushion the impact of coronavirus pandemic on their economies have raised fears of inflation. For instance, the United States Federal Reserve announced last year that it wants to push inflation above 2%. The central bank has been maintaining a policy of near-zero interest rates and has been buying $120 billion worth of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month.""There is no need for Bitcoin to replace fiat currencies to maintain value completely,"" said Vincenzo Furcillo, a risk analyst at Seeking Alpha. He added:"
2021-05-21,"  Despite Glassnode charts showing Bitcoiners are filling their bags, exchanges are seeing record inflows as investors trade their BTC for ETH. Many retail Bitcoiners bought the dip amid this week’s crypto market bloodbath, with on-chain data showing the small guys have accumulated an additional 12,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in the last month.Analyst William Clemente III shared data compiled by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode showing that the number of entities holding between 0.01 and 0.1 BTC surged as BTC’s price dropped.This is awesome. Plebs stacked harder than ever during this dip. pic.twitter.com/kpXpI0xLS5Crypto market data aggregator CryptoQuant, meanwhile, shared data showing a net outflow of roughly 4,000 BTC (approximately $163 million) from centralized exchanges.Net outflows to centralized exchanges are typically inferred to suggest coins are being moved into secure storage after being accumulated, while net inflows suggest coins are being moved out of cold storage to be sold on exchanges.The weekly netflow suggests this shift from selling to buying occurred only in the last two days.$BTC netflow across all exchanges became negative.Chart https://t.co/E67xlDEX6D pic.twitter.com/NpJ0sYQLuOChainalysis chief economist Philip Gradwell noted that whales with at least 1,000 BTC accumulated after 2017 had bought 34,000 BTC between Tuesda, suggesting many of these whales believed the bottom had hit or was near. Clemente III also noted a massive spike in OTC Bitcoin outflows since Tuesday, which he believes evidences significant buying from institutions or high-net-worth individuals. Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko shared Clemente III’s tweet, hinting that now is not the time to panic sell:Moskovski Capital chief investment officer Lex Moskovski also believes many investors are now buying, tweeting: “$5.28B of stablecoins were deposited to exchanges in 24h. This is absolute ATH. Even bigger than pre-Tesla announcement move. Lots of people bought the dip.”Binance founder Changpeng Zhao similarly noted recently surging stablecoin inflows alongside BTC and various ERC-20 tokens in a podcast interview this week with Scott Melker, aka the Wolf Of All Streets. However, Zhao did not mention seeing Ether (ETH) inflows. Arash Ghaemi, director of strategy at digital asset manager Two Prime, asserted that while Binance saw its biggest BTC inflow ever, ETH outflows were growing at a similar rate. He concluded that “people are rotating out of BTC into ETH which is why ETH/BTC held up during the pullback.”On the largest day of #BTC inflows to Binance ever, $ETH posts its 2nd largest outflow day ever.ETH continues to leave exchanges as BTC inflows to exchanges accelerate.Explanation: people are rotating out of BTC into ETH which is why ETH/BTC held up during the pullback. pic.twitter.com/wqBAekAYZMCrypto trader Cuban also noted the mass ETH outflow, with $1.3 billion in digital assets leaving centralized exchanges over a five-hour period on Wednesday."
2021-05-21,"  Despite being up 400,000% since June 2011, Bitcoin’s place in investment portfolios is still up for debate according to some investment banking analysts. Bitcoin’s price volatility is once again the subject of criticism from bankers as analysts from Société Générale take aim at the premier cryptocurrency.In an investor note quoted by CNBC, analysts at the bank argued that Bitcoin’s (BTC) “erratic price movements” devalued its place in investment portfolios.According to the investor note, the looming threat of government crackdowns across the globe puts significant downside pressure on future Bitcoin price action.Indeed, the recent BTC price plunge has also coincided with several negative regulatory moves from government agencies across the world. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the United States Treasury is looking to mandate reporting of crypto transactions above $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service.The Société Générale analysts also touched on the Bitcoin and gold comparisons, agreeing that investors see both assets as hedges against monetary debasement. However, beyond partial protection, the analysts identified positive price movements and fear-of-missing-out buying as the only claim to fame to both store of value assets, stating:Despite the recent price troubles for Bitcoin, BTC is up 38% year-to-date and 312% in the last year. While some bankers may identify volatility as a bug, proponents like Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, see volatility as a feature of Bitcoin’s long-term value potential.Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Yusko argued that volatility was a necessary part of Bitcoin’s 223% per annum positive compounding capability over the last decade.""#Bitcoin has the same amount of volatility as Amazon stock...when was the right time to sell Amazon? That would be never. Volatility is not your enemy."" @MarkYusko on $BTC and crypto volatility: pic.twitter.com/QLWcoR7DzA“Bitcoin has the same amount of volatility as Amazon stock […] When was the right time to sell Amazon?

2021-05-21,"  A ""mania top"" — the classic end of a Bitcoin bull run — has not appeared yet, and fundamentals are unchanged in their outlook, says Willy Woo. Bitcoin is still ""halfway"" through its current bull market, and this week's price dip turned out to be a ""win"" for hodlers, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo.In the latest edition of his market updates, which he made publicly accessible, the popular statistician outlined multiple factors that all suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is anything but bearish.BTC/USD recovered strongly after hitting lows of $30,000 on May 19, preserving its gains after the sharpest recovery in its history. ""Are we in a bull market? Long range macro indicators like NVT ratio are very healthy, that remains unchanged,"" Woo wrote.NVT, or network-value-to-transaction ratio, is a popular metric that aims at identifying profitability among hodlers. As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, even before the dip NVT was signaling a buying opportunity at price levels around $42,000.NVT price, which Woo calls an ""organic"" valuation of Bitcoin, still lies at $55,000, which along with stock-to-flow-based projections of $60,000 suggest that BTC/USD is considerably undervalued.The largest cryptocurrency may already have the tools it needs to regain its lost ground, thanks to a shakeout of leveraged traders and the now-muted effects of Elon Musk tweeting negative comments.In fact, the dip may have been just what Bitcoin needed.""Newish whales dumped out, retail bought a chunk of the dip, coins getting more distributed, I'll take that as a win,"" Woo added.Notably, the sharp drop to $30,000 resulted in Bitcoin funding rates flipping negative across the board to record lows, which could provide fuel for a massive short squeeze.""That cleanse set up Bitcoin for $100k. Funding rates largely reset,"" Messari analyst Mira Christanto commented regarding the latest Bitcoin funding rate data. She added: On the topic of a trader shakeout, fresh data from Glassnode shows just how much leverage was flushed from the market during the drop to $30,000 and the rise back to $40,000.Over the course of the day, open interest in Bitcoin futures fell from above $17 billion to below $13 billion and stayed at those levels.""Goodbye leverage,"" analyst William Clemente commented regarding the figures.For new buyers entering the space, Blockstream CEO Adam Back, meanwhile, had some cautionary words.""Thoughts on leverage. *don't*!"" he summarized in a series of tweets.

2021-05-21,"  Vitalik Buterin thinks crypto is in a bubble, but he doesn’t have a prediction of when it will pop, and he believes there is a “possibility” Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in the future.   Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thinks that crypto is in a bubble and that the energy debate swirling around Bitcoin (BTC) mining requires the blockhain to embrace technological change.Buterin spoke with CNN on Tuesday, noting that ""We've had at least three of these big crypto bubbles so far."" He added that it could have ended already, or it could end months from now.i like this kid https://t.co/4wRBuwSObQThe 27-year-old didn’t comment on whether the recent crash that sent Bitcoin down to around $30,000 was an indicator of the crypto bubble ending, but said:One factor in the Bitcoin price crash was Elon Musk’s announcement of his concerns over Bitcoin’s power usage. Philip Gradwell, chief economist of Chainalysis, said other institutional buyers may also hold concerns over crypto’s “environmental impact, use cases, illicit activity, and regulation.”Buterin told CNN that energy concerns over Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining are justified.Ethereum is in the process of moving from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, through the forthcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0. It will dramatically decrease Ethereum’s energy consumption, with Nimbus estimating proof-of-stake to be up to 99% more energy efficient. Buterin emphasized the importance of the transition, noting that:Buterin added that the power consumption of Bitcoin mining and the hardware required could see increasing calls from its community to either switch to proof-of-stake or move toward a hybrid model.While that call will undoubtedly be controversial, Bitcoiners may welcome Buterin’s assessment of Musk’s Twitter antics. He noted that this is a relatively new phenomenon in the crypto space, and Musk’s influence will wane over time. ""I think it's reasonable to expect a bit of craziness,"" he said. ""But I do think that the markets will learn. Elon is not going to have this influence forever."""
2021-05-20,"  Derivatives data for Bitcoin weekly options suggests bears may have the upper hand in tomorrow’s $930 million expiry. On May 21 at 8:00 AM UTC, $930 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) weekly options will expire. As usual, the leader Deribit holds a 90% share, but the recent market drop might have given bears too much power.While traders and analysts scramble to find a rationale for the 53% drop from the $64,900 all-time high, ExoAlpha CIO David Lifchitz perfectly described the recent market conditions when he said:The correction was so strong that even avid Bitcoin defenders flipped, including the global Chief Investment Officer of investment giant Guggenheim, who dubbed crypto markets as ‘tulipmania’.Regardless of the reasons behind the price action, traders that held previously inexpensive rights to sell Bitcoin at $45,000 or $46,000 are now celebrating.Although the current setup looks balanced between call (buy) options and the neutral-to-bearish put (sell) options, Bitcoin’s 30% drop has shifted the balance to favor bears over the past two weeks.Out of the 11,872 call options, only 15% have been created using $44,000 and lower strikes. This means the remaining 85% became worthless, as there are less than 14 hours left for the weekly expiry. Therefore, the 1,850 neutral-to-bullish call options below $44,500 represent a $75 million open interest. On the other hand, 88% of the put options have $36,000 or higher strikes. Those options allow its buyer to sell Bitcoin at a fixed price, so most commonly used on neutral-to-bearish strategies.Unlike futures contracts, there is not much gain in rolling over a losing position to the following week. As we approach the expiry date, a right to acquire Bitcoin at $50,000 is effectively worthless right now. That’s the reason why bears’ current advantage will likely continue exerting pressure.Overall, the put options at $36,000 and higher amount to $400 million in open interest. The $325 million difference favoring the more neutral-to-bearish options is a decent advantage as we approach Friday’s expiry.However, it is important to highlight that monthly options usually handle most of the action, and May 28 will be no different with $1.95 billion open interest. While it seems premature to call it, bears will likely continue to pressure markets considering there are almost no call options at $38,000 or lower for next week.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
2021-05-20,"  Analysts have mixed opinions now that Bitcoin price trades 40% away from its all-time high. ExoAlpha CIO David Lifchitz gives his take on what happened and what’s next for BTC.  On April 14 Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high at $64,850 and many of the crypto sector’s top analysts were calling for BTC to carry on to at least $100,000 before the rally showed any signs of possible exhaustion. Fast forward 37 days and Bitcoin now trades nearly 50% down from its all-time high after dropping as low as $30,000 to mark the sharpest correction in BTC price since March 2020. The general reaction among analysts has been mixed as some cite various metrics which suggest that $30,000 is the bottom for BTC. Others advise caution as the failure of BTC price to show a strong bounce from the current oversold conditions is a signal that further downside could be in store. To get a better handle on exactly what happened to Bitcoin and where the price might go from here, Cointelegraph spoke with David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer at ExoAlpha.  Cointelegraph: What led the market to this precipice and in your opinion what pushed Bitcoin price over the edge? David Lifchitz: Last week, just a few hours before Elon Musk's incendiary tweet about Bitcoin, we warned that there was more downside potential than upside potential for Bitcoin due to a lack of any upward catalyst on the horizon, and we have been served.Believe me or not, but on May 18, we discussed that when looking at Bitcoin on a weekly basis, we could see an ugly head and shoulders pattern with a neckline around $45,000. The top of the left shoulder reached during the week of February 8, the head (top) above $60,000 during the week of April 5, and the right shoulder top reached during the week of May 3. CT: Why was this head and shoulders pattern problematic? DL: Bitcoin was trading then around $43,000 right below the neckline, which was not very healthy as the expected output of such pattern would be a downward move of the same amplitude as between the neckline level and the top of the head, which were respectively about $45,000 and $60,000. This would mean a potential slide down to $30,000 which is where Bitcoin initially found support after taking a breather after its fall 2020 bullrun. This was just some technical analysis and probabilities but nothing guaranteed a return to $30,000. The price breaking down below $50,000, a level which had acted as previous support, drastically weakened Bitcoin in the short term.Moreover, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading at a historical discount could also be putting pressure on Bitcoin prices and if Grayscale doesn't act swiftly to reduce the discount, which it doesn't seem to have decided to do just yet, but we won’t go into to much detail on that.CT: Were institutions or retail behind the drop? DL: The head and shoulders pattern we discussed with a downside target around $30,000 that we discussed earlier has been spot on, even if it occurred quite quickly!However, as the dip at $30,000 has already been bought back up to $38,000 and as $40,000 looks like now to the new resistance level, let's see how Asia will react and how the US-time zone then reacts to the activity that occurs overseas. What could have sparked the selloff? Definitely some heavy selling of Bitcoin. Some might be wondering if Musk eventually dumped his Tesla Bitcoin (after having loaded up on puts of course) or was Grayscale forced to sell some of their holdings to meet a large investor request? Who knows! But the overleveraged environment in which crypto traders evolve definitely works in both ways. Moreover, traditional markets being overstretched to the point of letting go probably didn't help as well.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content of product on this page.

2021-05-20,"  It's a sea of green for Bitcoin and altcoins on Thursday as a tsunami of optimism erases the previous crypto bloodbath. Bitcoin (BTC) hit $42,000 on May 20 as altcoins joined the largest cryptocurrency in its record-breaking comeback.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC/USD spiking to previous all-time highs from February on Thursday.At the time of writing, volatility was back as bulls sought to tackle what was once formidable resistance. As Cointelegraph reported, the past 24 hours have been a test like no other for Bitcoin as selling pressure drove it to $30,000, only to evaporate and allow a run to $40,000 — all within around five hours.On Thursday, higher levels remained, with brief spikes hinting at major buy-ins frontrunning a concerted push higher.Versus the local lows, BTC/USD gained an unparalleled 40% in less than 24 hours. ""The most spectacular rallies happen when emotions within the market at their most extreme,"" popular Twitter trader Rekt Capital said as part of multiple posts as the market rose.Rekt Capital noted that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of sentiment, was practically repeating behavior from March 2020 when cryptocurrencies broadly crashed. As such, others were beginning to reveal long positions on the day in a further signal of the belief that the worst of the dip was over.#BTC is currently inside the $38000-$44000 rangeTwo things to watch out for in the short-term:• Can ~$38000 hold as support during a retest attempt?• Will ~$44000 turn into a resistance once tested?$BTC #Bitcoin https://t.co/cfdEZ2BVKt pic.twitter.com/Ha6u8EEHV2With altcoins, opportune moments for gains were also flowing in, with Cardano's ADA up over 70% and Dogecoin (DOGE) up 55%.The latter was flying high once again thanks to Twitter activity from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who on Thursday hinted at a plan to drive DOGE/USD to $1.How much is that Doge in the window? pic.twitter.com/bxTkWOr50VThe top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization saw 40% daily returns or more as Bitcoin led battered tokens back to where they were just days before.Ether (ETH) was up 40% at the time of writing, having previously briefly dipped below $2,000."
2021-05-20,"  $46,000 is in the cards for a bullish uptick, but concerns about lack of buyer support below $30,000 are a real threat for analysts. Bitcoin (BTC) is working to flip $40,000 to support after a record $10,000 bounce in four hours on Monday — what are the price levels to watch?After its stunning recovery from $30,000 lows, BTC/USD has held onto its gains, practically erasing the previous day’s carnage. With spot price still well below expectations, however, analysts are keenly eyeing possible resistance levels — as well as support — should a fresh dip take hold of the market.Bullish signs are everywhere at the time of writing. Funding rates are deeply negative; outflows from exchanges reached sky-high levels in the past 24 hours; and leveraged traders have been effectively washed out of the market with $8 billion in liquidations.Now, attention is turning to two price levels in particular, with these marking a likely floor and ceiling, respectively.First is $46,000, around $6,000 or 15% above spot price. As noted by on-chain monitoring resource Whalemap, this former support level is apt to act as resistance should Bitcoin see a further impulse move on short timeframes.$46,000 is also where the significant 20-week weighted moving average (WMA) currently lies. Traditionally, during bull runs, weekly candles stay above the rising 20WMA, and a violation of the trend could yet be a bad omen.“In terms of TA, 33k looks like a support,” Whalemap explained alongside charts. While those comments were made before the capitulatory move to $30,000, the appetite for selling remains closer to $50,000 and beyond.On the flipside, Whalemap warns, a comparative lack of buyer support below Wednesday’s lows could potentially open up a path to a further capitulation run as low as $19,000.“We need to hold 29k,” the Whalemap team told Cointelegraph. Momentary spikes in spot price on exchanges suggested that large trades to the upside were being entered at levels around $40,000 overnight.“If you buy something because price went up, you will sell as soon as price stops going up or goes down... If you buy something because you believed current price was below fair value or future growth would increase value, when price falls you will buy more...,” Mark Yusko, founder, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, told Twitter followers overnight.The volume of stablecoins flowing into exchanges stands as testimony to the level of interest in acquiring cryptocurrency at the $30,000 price point. According to data from CryptoQuant, this has reached a new all-time high."
2021-05-20,"  One crypto critic thinks Ether, not Bitcoin, has a better chance of becoming a commodity in a possible blockchain-based future. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, has tipped Ether (ETH) as having a better chance of becoming a commodity than Bitcoin (BTC).Speaking to CNBC, the NYU professor argued that Ethereum’s upside potential outweighs that of Bitcoin in a possible future paradigm dominated by blockchain-based technology.According to Damodaran, ETH will trump BTC as a better lubricant for blockchain commerce. As for Bitcoin, the NYU professor said that the premier crypto was a speculative play, adding:Indeed, decentralized finance as an emerging market segment has grown massively on the Ethereum network. According to DappRadar, the adjusted total value locked in ETH-based DeFi protocols is above $65 billion as of the time of writing.Earlier in May, Uniswap — an ETH-based decentralized exchange — flipped Bitcoin on daily revenue indicating the scale of the transaction volume disparity between Ethereum and Bitcoin.Damodaran’s Bitcoin critique is not new as the NYU professor called BTC an “inefficient currency” earlier in May. Back in August 2017, Damodaran, popularly dubbed Wall Street’s “dean of valuation” described Bitcoin as a “pricing game with no good ending.”The NYU professor of finance also called for a more nuanced crypto nomenclature that better captures the differences among existing cryptocurrencies. According to Damodaran, “I think we need to start to separate the crypto space into those cryptos that are trying to be currencies, those cryptos that are trying to be collectibles — millennial gold — and those cryptos that are actually commodities.”As previously reported, the crypto market is in the middle of a massive downtrend with Bitcoin dipping more than 30% in the last eight days. The total market capitalization has also taken a huge dent, losing over $800 billion within the same period."
2021-05-20,"  A new report from Stack Funds anticipates that Bitcoin dominance is likely to see an uptick soon, further supporting the asset's price in the short term. Stack Funds — an issuer of crypto access products that include trackers, indexes and structure vehicles for institutions — has released a new report predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance is set to ratchet back up to former highs in the near future.As of the start of 2021, Bitcoin dominance — the cryptocurrency's share of the total market capitalization of all crypto assets — has been on a steady decline, down from 72.3% in January to roughly 40% this week. As Stack Funds' head of research Lennard Neo notes, that figure represents a three-year low since May 2018. Whilst BTC dominance has continued to go south, total market capitalization has gone in the opposite direction, gaining 40% in value over the same time frame. For Stack Funds, this implies that investors' capital remains locked in the crypto markets. Neo notes that key sectoral rotation has been at play, with investors seeking to maximize opportunity costs, as seen by the rise of Ether's (ETH) price by almost 180% at last month's highs.However, the dynamics between dominance and the wider markets suggest a swing back in trends. For Stack Funds, BTC dominance is long due for a rebound:Stack Funds' report also notes the dramatic volatility of the past week, echoing other commentators and analysts who have pointed to the impact of comments from Elon Musk and his company Tesla, as well as bearish news of a potentially renewed crypto crackdown in China."
2021-05-20,"  BTC price action effectively knocks down and rebuilds the market while holding onto its $10,000 gains. Bitcoin (BTC) saw a dip like no other on Wednesday, falling to $30,000 in a frantic three-hour shakeout that upended the market.As the dust settles, however, it’s no longer about the dip, but rather the recovery — what makes current BTC price action special?It took around one hour for BTC/USD to go from $39,000 to $30,000 on Wednesday. This is a formidable drop but nothing unheard of when it comes to historical price action.In dollar terms rather than a percentage, however, that hour was unlike anything seen before. Even during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, Bitcoin’s 60% correction was smaller when measured in United States dollars.$BTC: Officially a +50% correction. First one in more than a year.If that weren’t enough, what happened next was even more unusual. After bouncing at exactly $30,000, Bitcoin shot up to $37,000 almost immediately, going on to crack $40,000 shortly after. This was the biggest rebound ever seen, squarely beating March 2020 in both percentage and raw USD terms. As skeptical sources called a “dead cat bounce,” Bitcoin held fast, still circling at around $39,000 over 12 hours after the bounce at the time of writing.Bitcoin’s market composition changed over the past 24 hours and is now likely made up of a different class of trader.This is due to the veracity of both the dip and the recovery. In total, daily liquidations among traders totaled over $8 billion.This was also far from a rare occurrence, as price volatility regularly claims the wealth of large numbers of leveraged traders in particular. Due to the size of the dip in USD, however, anyone with a long bet likely got frozen out of the market with nothing.The way back up likewise took care of those banking on a further retracement toward the old all-time highs of $20,000. Support levels, order book data showed at the time, were broadly absent below $30,000, meaning that such a scenario was a real possibility.Just how nervous traders have become as a result of recent events is shown by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index.The classic sentiment indicator dropped to just 11/100, firmly within its “extreme greed” zone and its lowest reading since April 2020. Fear & Greed was at 73, or “greed,” as recently as May 9, making its own drop something of a unique event in its existence. The implication, therefore, is that sentiment around cryptocurrency is currently unduly skewed to the downside, with a correction of oversold token prices expected.“Bitcoin at 40k and appetite for risk is still rock bottom,” popular Twitter account Bitcoin Archive commented on the Index. "
2021-05-20,"  Traders racing to exit leveraged positions on-chain appeared to drive a record spike in Ethereum gas prices on Wednesday, with users reporting transaction fees of more than $1,000 still got stuck. Ethereum fees surged to record highs amid the recent crypto downturn, with users paying more than 2,000 gwei to execute transactions.Digital asset research firm Delphi Digital noted gas prices oscillated between 1,500 and 1,700 gwei for approximately one hour as DeFi liquidations drove “gas wars amongst liquidators and arbitrageurs.”In the May 19 Daily Gwei newsletter, Ethereum developer Anthony Sassano speculated the fee frenzy was likely triggered by on-chain margin traders racing to exit their leveraged positions:Chris Weston of Melbourne-based brokerage Pepperstone also emphasized the role of leverage in the crash, estimating that cascading margin calls drove $9.13 billion worth of liquidations across crypto exchanges in 24 hours.Alameda Research’s Sam Trabucco also noted high leverage in the Ethereum markets, criticizing the narrative that Ethereum’s rally was largely fueled by institutional spot buying.“I saw a TON of speculation that the rallies (especially the ETH rallies) were low-leverage and spot-driven, and therefore more organic somehow [...] This narrative was super wrong,” said Trabucco.That people thought ETH in particular was just all institutions buying on Coinbase or something was particularly baffling to me. Look at these GIANT OIs/premia as ETH skyrocketed to its ATH! This was all on leverage, just waiting for a day like today to come along ... pic.twitter.com/v4tpVd7teUCrypto luminaries were not exempt from the gas crisis, with CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors tweeting about her stuck transactions despite paying more than $1,000 in gas fees. the market punching me in the face, and reminding me, once again, that blockchain compute is a finite resource pic.twitter.com/OZIAwg0LjoHowever, some analytics were able to find a silver lining amid the skyrocketing fees, with Paradigm’s Hasu estimating that Ether (ETH) stakers would have captured “tens to hundreds of millions of dollars” in fee revenue if EIP-1559 and proof-of-stake had been live during the crash."
2021-05-19,"  Retail traders capitulated as Bitcoin and Ether dropped to multi-month lows and technical indicators suggest the markets could remain volatile over the next few days.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) massive bloodbath on May 19 resulted in panic selling across the board. Several major altcoins nosedived between 25% to 50% during the day. The extent of the fall shows that many large traders may have dumped their positions and leverage traders may have been roasted.In a report to its clients on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase analysts pointed out that institutional investors were abandoning Bitcoin in favor of gold. Considering the volatility ratio of Bitcoin to gold, JP Morgan believes Bitcoin’s current fair value is $35,000.The massive fall today is likely to scare several institutional investors and delay their entry into the space. Although there will be periodic rebounds and sharp bear rallies, the next bull run may not start in a hurry.Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz also told CNBC that the decline feels like capitulation and this breakdown may not be fixed quickly.After the sharp decline and the subsequent rebound, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the support and resistance levels.Bitcoin’s close below the neckline on May 17 completed the bearish head and shoulders pattern. The buyers attempted to push the price back above the neckline on May 18 but failed as seen from the long wick on today’s candlestick. The selling picked up momentum today and turned into capitulation as the BTC/USDT pair plunged to $29,257.95, exceeding the H&S pattern target at $31,653.73. This fall has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into the oversold territory for the first time since March 2020.Generally, after such a sharp fall, a pullback can be expected because traders who initiated short positions at higher levels may book profits and aggressive bulls may have purchased near the critical support at $28,850.The long tail on the candlestick suggests strong buying on dips but the rise from the current levels may not be easy because the bulls are likely to encounter massive supply at the neckline. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could consolidate in a large range between $28,850 and $44,000 for the next few days.Ether (ETH) broke below the 50-day simple moving average ($2,760) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,467.78 today. This resulted in panic selling and the biggest altcoin plummeted below the 78.6% retracement at $1,949.41 to hit an intraday low at $1,801.60.However, a minor positive is that buyers have aggressively bought the dip as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. If the bulls can sustain the price above the 50-day SMA, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 20-day exponential moving average ($3,370). This move is likely to attract selling from the bears because the sentiment has turned negative.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA. If this level holds, the pair may consolidate between the moving averages.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair may gradually drop to $1,801.60. If this level holds, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days. However, if the bears sink the price below $1,801.60, the down move may reach $1,289.09.The buyers defended the $480 support on May 17 and 18 but the incessant selling today dragged Binance Coin (BNB) to $280. With today's decline, the altcoin came close to a 100% retracement of the bull run that started from $233.81 on March 26.The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating the trend has changed from bullish to bearish. Any relief rally from the current level is likely to face stiff resistance at $428 and again at $480.If the price turns down from either level, the BNB/USDT pair may retest $233.81. If this level also gives way, the next support is at $186.10. The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively. Cardano (ADA) formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 18, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears. The uncertainty resolved to the downside today, resulting in a massive long liquidations by the bulls.The capitulation pulled the ADA/USDT pair down to $0.95 today, its lowest level since April 23. However, the bulls have purchased the dip aggressively as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the bulls can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.74), it will suggest strong demand at lower levels. The pair may then consolidate between $1.48 and $2 for a few days. Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below $1.48, the pair could gradually drop to $1.Although Dogecoin (DOGE) sustained above the 20-day EMA ($0.46) for the past few days, the bulls could not achieve a strong rebound. This showed a lack of demand at higher levels.The DOGE/USDT pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($0.30) and hit an intraday low at $0.21. The bulls have purchased the dip aggressively as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.35, the pair could rise to the 20-day EMA. This level is likely to attract selling and the pair may then remain range-bound between the moving averages for a few days.XRP pierced the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on May 18 but the long wick on the candlestick suggests the bulls could not sustain the breakout. The price reversed direction today and plummeted below the support line of the triangle, which may have resulted in huge long liquidations.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dip to the critical support at $0.88. The buyers will now try to push the price back into the triangle but they are likely to face stiff resistance at the moving averages.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA ($1.31), the XRP/USDT pair could again gradually drop to $0.88. If the support holds, the pair may consolidate between $1.20 and $0.88 for a few days.Polkadot (DOT) attempted to take support at the moving averages on May 18 but the demand fizzled out at $42.59. The altcoin turned down today and deep dived to $18, the lowest level since Feb. 3.If the price closes below $26.50, the bears may continue to pound the DOT/USDT pair and retest the $18 support. On the contrary, if the relief rally sustains above $26.50, it will suggest the capitulation may be over. The pair could then gradually move up to $32.50 and then to the moving averages.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance but stays above $26.50 during the next decline, a range-bound action may ensue.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) attempted at recovery on May 18 but could not rise above the 20-day EMA ($1,134). The long wick on the day’s candlestick showed that traders are selling on rallies to stiff resistance levels.The selling picked up momentum after the BCH/USDT pair broke below $940 and the next critical support at $686.75. The pair finally hit an intraday low at $473.84, its lowest level since March 26.Aggressive bulls seem to have purchased at lower levels, resulting in a strong recovery as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. However, the relief rally is likely to hit a hurdle near $940. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could consolidate in a large range between $442.96 and $940 for the next few days.The bulls defended the 50-day SMA ($272) on May 17 but they could not extend the recovery above the 20-day EMA ($299) on May 18. This suggests that traders sold their Litecoin (LTC) positions during the relief rally.Today, the selling resumed and the LTC/USDT pair plunged below the 50-day SMA and the support line of the broadening wedge pattern. This may have resulted in panic selling, dragging the price down to $143.57, the lowest level since Feb. 05.If the price closes below the support line, the bears may resume selling and a retest of $143.57 may be on the cards. Conversely, if the price climbs back into the wedge, the pair may rise to the moving averages where it is again likely to encounter selling from the bears.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the support line of the ascending channel on May 17 but the bulls pushed the price back into the range on May 18. However, the buyers could not clear the hurdle at the 20-day EMA ($36), indicating selling at higher levels.The UNI/USDT pair turned down today and broke below the support line of the channel. The selling picked up momentum after the $25.52 support cracked. This may have caused long liquidation, resulting in a drop to an intraday low at $16.However, the positive sign is that the bulls purchased this dip and are attempting to start a relief rally. This rally may face stiff resistance at $30 and then again at the moving averages. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may drop to $25.52 and remain range-bound for a few days.Alternatively, if the price closes below $25.52, the bears may try to build on their advantage and sink the price to $16.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-19,"  Bitcoin is ""not going to bounce right back,"" said Mike Novogratz right before it bounced back to the $42,000s. The price of Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies may have taken a double-digit percentage drop in the last 24 hours, but some crypto experts still seem to be cautiously optimistic about the market as a whole.In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Wednesday, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz said that it was “going to take a while” for crypto markets to consolidate and find a bottom as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dipped to $30,000 earlier in the day. Novogratz’s comments came when the price of the crypto asset was roughly $38,000, having been more than $42,000 at the close of stock markets yesterday.""You had a confluence of events: a combination of tax day, Elon Musk tweets, whatnot and we started breaking down the positivity in the price action, and now we’ve got a liquidation event,” said Novogratz. “It's not going to bounce right back, it’ll consolidate for a while.”""It felt like we had capitulation this morning,"" says @Novogratz on #bitcoin. ""You had a confluence of events a combination of tax day, @elonmusk tweets, what not and we started breaking down the positivity in the price action...it's not going to bounce right back."" pic.twitter.com/n0QqjOmh21Though the Galaxy Digital CEO estimated that Bitcoin could hit a bottom at $36,000 or $38,000, the price rebounded slightly to reach $42,434 before sliding back under $40,000. At the time of publication, the price is in the $38,000 range.There are likely many factors at play concerning the recent crypto market volatility. Cryptocurrency prime broker Genesis Global Trading reported there was a Bitcoin-driven sell-off overnight due to forced liquidations and levered closeouts. Meanwhile, the firm said many Ether (ETH) cash buyers came in when the price of the token dropped under $2,000 for the first time since early April, and macro funds were buying BTC when the price hit $35,000.“While the initial volumes at the beginning of this morning’s rally off the lows were muted, we're seeing the market stabilize with more consistent institutional appetite,” said Genesis.Others in the crypto space — including Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky, CEO and founder of validator node hosting platform Allnodes, and Steve Ehrlich, CEO and co-founder Voyager Digital — said the recent price drops may be attributed to people migrating their investments following reports that China had allegedly banned crypto exchanges, services and transactions. Three associations in the country recently outlined issues related to crypto investments and warned people of the market risks.“Correction in the cryptocurrency market is a common phenomenon,” said Boyko-Romanovsky. “It doesn’t mean, however, that a bear market is underway. The latter would be the case if the blockchain industry were showing signs of slowing down. That can’t be further from the truth.”Ehrlich added:"
2021-05-19,"  Regulatory concerns, a bit of FUD and the uncertainties surrounding Tether appear to have exaggerated the Bitcoin price sell-off, but derivatives data suggests that the bottom is likely in. After an agonizing 35% loss in the past 24-hours, Bitcoin (BTC) finally bounced at $30,000 earlier today in the May 19 trading session. A total of $3.5 billion in liquidations took place, which might have accelerated the movement, but they can't really be entirely blamed for the move.However, the weakness in derivatives markets did give some strong signals that panic was instilled, causing unsustainable levels. These can be measured by the price gap between the futures markets and regular spot exchanges, along with the negative funding rate on perpetual contracts.Pinpointing the exact culprit of the price movement is a daunting task, although Elon Musk's remarks on Bitcoin mining coal usage likely played some role. However, May 19 marked the deadline for Tether Holdings Limited's breakdown of Tether's (USDT) reserves to the Office of the New York Attorney General.Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Avanti Financial, stated that traders might have felt compelled to sell other cryptocurrencies to reduce their total risk exposure given the credit risk that emerged from Tether's reserve disclosure.As reported by Cointelegraph, regulatory uncertainties entered the spotlight earlier this month when United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler expressed their concerns about the cryptocurrency sector.On May 18, a banking and trade association under the People's Bank of China issued a statement titled ""Preventing the risk of virtual currency transaction speculation."" It then went on to call on member institutions to abide by existing regulatory provisions regarding digital currencies.The combination of these bearish factors resulted in the 50% correction seen in the past nine days, and its impact on futures markets finally showed clear signals of exhaustion. By analyzing the futures markets' price difference versus regular spot exchanges, one can better understand how the price move has impacted professional traders.Typically, the three-month futures should trade with an 8% to 15% annualized premium, comparable to the stablecoin lending rate. By postponing settlement, sellers demand a higher price, causing the price difference.Over the past couple of weeks, the indicator sustained above the 8% level, signaling confidence. However, during the dip to $30,000 on May 19, the situation changed drastically as a backwardation emerged for the first time in a year. In this case, the futures markets trade below the regular spot exchange prices — a very concerning situation.As the futures premium quickly reestablished a healthy 7% level, one might conclude that it had been caused by stop loss and liquidation orders that pushed the price down to $30,000.To better assess whether this movement was something specific to the monthly and quarterly futures, we should look at the perpetual futures contracts. These derivatives, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours to ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances.Whales, arbitrage desks and market makers avoid exposure on these contracts due to their variable funding rate. When longs demand more leverage, they are the ones paying the fee. The opposite holds when shorts are using more leverage, thus causing a negative funding rate.As shown above, the indicator entered unsustainable levels, as a -0.20% rate equals a 4.3% weekly fee paid by short-sellers. This situation is seldom sustainable for more than a couple of days, as it incentives buyers to enter long positions.Both the U.S. regulatory uncertainty and Office of the New York Attorney General's action on Tether's disclosure might take months or years to develop. Meanwhile, China's actions show no difference from the September 2017 move when the country announced the shutdown of all exchange operations and initial coin offerings.Thus, considering the negative futures premium and perpetual contracts funding rate impact, it is safe to say that $30,000 was the rock bottom of liquidations. The 54% price correction from the $64,900 all-time high marks the exaggerated market reaction to speculation rather than the reaction to news that could harm Bitcoin's functionalities and importance as a scarce, censorship-resistant asset.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-19,"  Bitcoin slipped below the 20-week exponential moving average for the first time since February 2020, which is a big bearish signal. Bitcoin bulls should brace for aggressive downside market corrections in the sessions ahead, especially as the benchmark cryptocurrency breaks below a critical support level.Dubbed the 20-week exponential moving average (EMA), the wave has historically served as a primary downside target for bulls to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC). For instance, the BTC/USD exchange rate maintained its bullish bias all across 2020 while trading above the 20-week EMA wave. It eventually closed the year up more than 400%.Similarly, the 20-week EMA wave supported massive bullish rallies in the April–June 2019 session. Meanwhile, the price floor overstayed its welcome in the 2015–2017 session as Bitcoin surged from $250 to $20,000.Conversely, slipping below the 20-week EMA wave brought havoc to the Bitcoin market. For instance, the January–December 2018 session logged a 72% decline after the BTC/USD rate slipped below the 20-week EMA. It repeated the same pattern in the September 2019–March 2020 trading session; the pair fell by around 60% after breaking below said wave support.Negative fundamentals also fueled sell-offs in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In 2018, traders offloaded their Bitcoin positions under the influence of initial coin offering scams. Meanwhile, in 2019, worries over Facebook's Libra token launch, coupled with the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork and its potential impact on the Bitcoin network, pulled prices lower.In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic prompted a global market crash. In February, Bitcoin, which was sitting atop attractive rebound profits, became an ideal scapegoat for investors to withdraw their profits to cover their losses in other traditional markets.Bitcoin's break below the 20-week EMA support this week appeared out of a flurry of panic-inducing events. First, Elon Musk, who had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin via his electric vehicle firm Tesla, reversed his decision to accept the cryptocurrency as payment, citing environmental concerns.The ""emotional billionaire,"" as described by Anthony Pompliano, doubled his attack on Bitcoin over the weekend after raising alarms that he would unload his $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency. That thoroughly coincided with a breakdown in Bitcoin's price. First, it fell from $55,000 to $50,000, then to nearly $42,000.The 20-week EMA during the price-decline period was near the $46,000 level. This week, BTC/USD crashed to a new sessional low of $30,000 on Coinbase.The technical fractals alone suggest that Bitcoin's price eyes an extended downside correction toward its 50-week simple moving average (SMA) (the blue wave in the chart above). Part of the reason is the cryptocurrency's tendency to test the 20-week EMA wave for pullbacks. The ""Fractal 2"" box in the chart above shows the same: Bitcoin maintained support above the blue wave before crashing below it in the wake of pandemic FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt. The ""Fractal 1"" box also shows the same.Meanwhile, when even the 50-week SMA did not hold up strong against bears, the prices crashed toward the 200-week SMA. At present, the 200-week SMA sits near $12,800.""If we see the low $30,000s soon, it will then be a question of will we see $10,000–$20,000,"" noted Clem Chambers, chief executive of financial research outlet ADVFN.""To me, that’s possible because when the ‘I bought at the top’ brigade stampedes for the exit, it will get extremely spicy,"" he added.Higher inflation remains one of the core bullish catalysts behind the yearlong Bitcoin price rally. It has soared by more than 300% in the previous 12 months, despite the recent downside correction, taking cues from the Federal Reserve's aggressive quantitative easing policy that has lifted investment appeal off traditional safe-havens, including government bonds and the U.S. dollar.Bitcoin bulls present it as a provably scarce asset, citing its limited supply cap of 21 million coins. That has prompted veteran investors such as Stan Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones, and Mike Novogratz to gain exposure in the cryptocurrency market.Meanwhile, corporate houses other than Tesla, which include Square and MicroStrategy, have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a measure against inflation. Institutional banking systems such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also announced Bitcoin-enabled investment services for their wealthy clients, pointing that they would be preparing for a spike in demand from mainstream investors.Novogratz reminded people on Tuesday that Bitcoin is still trading about 32% higher on a year-to-date timeframe, telling CNBC that sometimes markets get ahead of themselves and correct lower to neutralize the overall sentiment. He added:""We are seeing more and more institutions,"" says @Novogratz. ""I just see an inexorable move from financial institutions and tech companies into the #crypto space. Will it all be #bitcoin or #ethereum? I think #bitcoin will preserve its lane as a stored value."" pic.twitter.com/f2yJkfwTFZOn Tuesday, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest increased its crypto exposure by scooping up 118,214 shares of Coinbase, a United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, in a major portfolio reshuffle."
2021-05-19,"  The cryptocurrency market is painted red after numerous coins lost more than 30% in the past 24 hours. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization lost in excess of $350 billion overnight leading into Wednesday as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and a majority of the altcoin market lost between 15% and 30%.Tuesday night’s plunge leaves the global market cap more than $750 billion worse off than it was this time last week. That figure equates to 30% of the $2.5 trillion peak reached by the combined market cap one week ago on May 12. Bitcoin lost 15% on the day as the coin price sank from $45,632 to $38,787 in a matter of hours. That takes the coin’s weekly losses to over 32%. The only time Bitcoin lost as much as this in such short a time frame was in late 2017, just as BTC’s bull run at the time came to a screeching halt.Ether lost more than 19% on the day as it fell from $3,562 to $2,881 and added to weekly losses of 33.8%.Other altcoins, particularly recent gainers, were subject to even worse reversals. Internet Computer (ICP) lost 32% during the past 24 hours, which took weekly losses to over 61% and sent the coin crashing out of the market cap top 10 after appearing there so suddenly less than a month ago.Other tokens that hit all-time highs during the past week saw similar losses to ICP. Nexo lost 30% of its market value last night, taking the weekly pullback to 43%. Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost 29% on the day, which added to weekly losses of 66%. Shiba Inu’s sharp reversal predictably followed a barking mad surge that saw the Dogecoin (DOGE) imitator’s perceived value increase by over 2,000,000% since the start of the year. Inflows of Bitcoin to major centralized exchanges soared during the past 24 hours. More coins were sent to trading posts than at any time since the “Black Thursday” crash of 2020 — a fact that led Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, to conclude: “People are scared.”"
2021-05-19,"  High Bitcoin inflows to centralized exchanges have prompted predictions of further bearish momentum on social media. Bitcoin (BTC) inflows to centralized exchanges have surged, prompting bearish speculation that the crypto markets could be building up to a violent wash-out.Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovoski Capital, shared data showing that 22,917 BTC was transferred onto centralized exchanges in a single hour on Tuesday. Moskovski noted the hourly inflow was the largest since the March 2020 “Black Thursday” crash.22,917 #Bitcoin in a single hour were deposited to exchanges yesterday.This hourly inflow is rivaled only by the March, 2020 crash.People are scared. pic.twitter.com/uH4lBL6OnkWith outflows from exchanges typically being inferred as indicating crypto assets are being moved into cold storage for security or DeFi protocols for yield generation, inflows are interpreted as assets being moved onto centralized platforms to be sold.Data compiled by on-chain crypto analytics firm Glassnode shows the past two days have seen consecutive all-time highs produced for net transfer volume of Bitcoin onto leading centralized exchange Binance. The data was shared by Twitter analyst William Clemente III to his 70,400 followers, triggering bearish price predictions on social media.Largest day of BTC inflows to Binance ever. pic.twitter.com/HG56s37mtvThe chart indicates roughly 35,000 Bitcoin worth more than $1.4 billion has been deposited on Binance in the past 48 hours.“Feels like capitulation,” said Kraken growth lead Dan Held. Clemente replied: “Let’s see one final nasty liquidation wick.” Despite Bitcoin’s price grinding down to post local lows below $40,000, some analysts are finding reasons to be bullish.Popular analyst Lark Davis noted the recent downturn has pushed Bitcoin’s 14-day relative-strength indicator into oversold territory for the first time since March 2020, suggesting the crash may be nearing its plateau.Others are welcoming capitulation as a likely catalyst for a bullish recovery, predicting a swift return to upward momentum once selling has become exhausted.Twitter user YHRW80 noted surging flows into Bitcoin’s spot and derivatives markets during 2021, concluding that the dominant emotion gripping the markets is “greed” rather than fear. However, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index disagrees with YHRW80’s analysis, describing current Bitcoin market sentiment as “extreme fear.”There was some welcome news today, with Indian media reporting the country’s government is set to rethink its planned crypto ban and form a new panel of experts to explore regulating crypto assets in India. Some analysts suggest the catalyst for the surging inflows is tomorrow’s looming deadline for controversial stablecoin issuer Tether to disclose its quarterly financial records as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office.Last week, Tether posted a breakdown of its reserves for the first time, asserting three-quarters of the assets backing its stablecoin are cash, cash equivalents, other short-term deposits and commercial paper."
2021-05-18,"  Two key Bitcoin price metrics signal that whales bought the dip to $42,000, a hint that BTC may be gearing up for a new all-time high by mid-June. As Bitcoin (BTC) tested the $43,000 support for the third consecutive day, whales bought the dip on derivatives exchanges. While there has been no significant price change, the Bitcoin futures premium reached its lowest level in six months. This indicator matches Dec. 11, 2020, when Bitcoin hit a $17,600 low just 10 days after making an all-time high at $19,915.In December 2020, derivatives action triggered a 95% rally in 23 days, taking Bitcoin to a new high at $42,000. In addition to the futures premium bottoming, rumors of potentially harmful United States regulation played a central-stage role in the market downturn in both instances. This time around, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated at the Washington Square Journal CEO Council Summit on May 4 that: On May 6, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler punted to Congress the idea of providing more regulatory oversight to the crypto space. Gensler said: Adding to the regulatory haze, on May 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued an investor warning pointing out risks of mutual funds that have exposure to Bitcoin futures.As Bitcoin reached a $19,915 all-time high on Dec. 1 and the futures premium spiked above 15%, the premium reacted to the price correction. Although the 8% low seems near the previous month’s average, it is very modest considering Bitcoin had rallied 90% in two months.Notice that as soon as the $17,600 level proved its strength, the futures premium spiked to 15%, indicating optimism.The current situation began differently, as the market has been excessively optimistic from the start. However, the situation drastically changed over the past week as Bitcoin dropped 26%. This move caused the futures premium to reach its lowest level in six months at 8%.However, the bearish sentiment on May 17 lasted for a very short period, as whales finally decided it was time to buy the dip. The top traders' long-to-short indicator is calculated using clients' consolidated positions, including margin, perpetual and futures contracts. This metric provides a broader view of the professional traders' effective net position by gathering data from multiple markets.Top traders on OKEx moved from a 1.62 long-to-short ratio on May 16 to a 2.74 peak as Bitcoin tested the $43,000 support in the early hours of May 17. This data indicates that whales and market makers had long positions almost three times larger than shorts, which is very uncommon.While their bullish bet remains, it signals a complete pattern from the previous week. Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy also scooped up another $10 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $43,663. Although it might be too soon to declare that the correction phase has ended, there seems to be enough evidence regarding the futures premium bottoming and whales' intense buying activity below $43,000.If history repeats and a 95% rally follows suit, Bitcoin could reach $83,000 in mid-June.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-18,"  Altcoins took the reins and galloped higher, while bulls appear to be losing the battle to hold Bitcoin's price above $43,000. On May 18, Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall cryptocurrency market faced another round of selling as FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — impacted investor sentiment after Reuters and various social media outlets reported that China would ban financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions. According to these reports, China also issued a warning to several Chinese trade associations about the dangers of cryptocurrency investing.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that bulls attempted to push the price of Bitcoin back above the $45,000 resistance level on May 18 only to have the price battered back below $43,000.While the conditions for Bitcoin may appear dire to some, several fundamental developments including, increased BTC outflows from the top United States crypto exchange Coinbase and the revelation that MicroStrategy used this most recent dip to buy another $10 million worth of BTC, indicate the potential for further upside for the top cryptocurrency. The precarious nature of the current market conditions for Bitcoin is perhaps summed up best in the following tweet from cryptocurrency analyst and Twitter personality Rekt Capital, which highlights the importance of the upcoming daily close for BTC.Every time #BTC Daily Closed inside green support or above it - a bullish reversal would take place#Bitcoin is back at green support again but instead is hovering below it nowGreen may flip to new resistance if BTC can't Daily Close inside/above greenhttps://t.co/2p4FgWWEIi pic.twitter.com/2iGcjLkAgUDespite the full-frontal FUD assault that the crypto market has been under in recent weeks, many altcoins have seen their prices breakout over the past couple of days as traders rotate out of underperforming tokens and into tokens that have turned bullish. The standout performance of the week goes to MATIC, the native token of Polygon, a rapidly rising Ethereum layer-two solution that has morphed into an oasis for traders looking for lower fees. According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for MATIC have been favorable for some time, as evidenced it's the recent VORTECS™ Score of 99 on May 15, which was recorded roughly 50 hours before its price rallied 83% from a low of $1.47 on May 17 to a new all-time high at $2.70 on May 18. This move took place as there was a record $6.84 billion in 24-hour trading volume.Synthetix Network Token (SNX) has also received a boost in trading volume on May 18 that lifted its price 40% to an intraday high at $25.64, while the Binance Smart Chain-based DeFi platform Venus' XVS token rallied 63% to an intraday high of $143.41. Other notable double-digit gainers include 40% gains for ARK and Celer Network's CELR, as well as 20% gains for AAVE and Helium Network Token (HNT). The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $2.076 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 39.4%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-18,"  A simple look back at past BTC price dips means that a 55% correction from all-time highs is on the table, says Carter Worth. Bitcoin (BTC) could drop to $29,000 and still be testing current support in line with past dips, claims CNBC’s “Chartmaster.”In an appearance on the network’s Fast Money segment on Monday, Carter Worth, chief market technician of Cornerstone Macro, warned that the BTC bottom may be far from in.Analyzing recent price activity and comparing it to past Bitcoin bottoms, Worth said that current levels at around $45,000 represent the top of a support zone.“Were we to go down 55%, we’d be in the lower end of support,” he summarized.A 55% drop from current all-time highs would mean BTC/USD bottoms out at just above $29,000. For Worth, this is a useful reference point, as 55% marks the average of every major price dip of 30% or more since 2011. As Twitter users noted, however, his calculations include events such as the 80% decline from all-time highs in 2017 — a process that took over a year to unfold.Remove these, and the average is more like 36% — just about where BTC/USD bottomed this week.The mood among mainstream media more broadly on Bitcoin and altcoins is once again cautious in light of the publicity generated by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Added to this, the mixed fortunes of Coinbase’s COIN mean that bearish sentiment remains de rigueur for analysts who have spent months in shock at the pace of the industry’s gains.As Cointelegraph reported, however, seasoned analysts from within Bitcoin circles are far from concerned, highlighting intact long-term price trends and even signs of bullishness already appearing.On Monday, PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow BTC price model, sought to draw a line under the Musk episode.“OK moving on .. with current volatility, BTC at $44K and transaction volumes high, Bitcoin momentum (200 Week Moving Average and Realized Value) is still up and onward,” he commented on an accompanying chart.Realized value represents the price at which the entire Bitcoin market bought BTC and continues to advance despite recent volatility."
2021-05-17,"  Traders appear disinterested in buying Bitcoin at the current levels, suggesting that further downside could be in store for BTC and altcoins.  Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to an intraday low near $42,000 today, dropping 35% from its all-time high at $64,849.27. Over the weekend the selling intensified as news that Tesla may have sold its Bitcoin holdings made waves, and even after this was proven to be untrue, Bitcoin’s market dominance had still been pulled down to a three-year low below 40%. While this decline in Bitcoin may have scared new investors, stock-to-flow creator PlanB said the performance of the current bull phase is still better than the 2017 bull run. PlanB also warned investors to expect several 30% dips during Bitcoin’s climb to a new all-time high.Although the long-term story remains intact, the sharp bearish moves in Bitcoin on every minor negative news tidbit suggest nervousness among investors. The lack of a sharp recovery even after Elon Musk’s clarification that “Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin” suggests investors are not buying aggressively on positive news.Will Bitcoin’s weakness stall the altcoin season or is Bitcoin getting ready for a sharp relief rally? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin broke below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern on May 16 but the bears could not achieve a close below it. By the end of the day, the price rebounded and closed above the neckline.However, the selling resumed today and the bears have pulled the price below the neckline. If the BTC/USDT pair closes below the neckline, the head and shoulders pattern will complete. If the bulls do not push the price back above the neckline quickly, the selling is likely to intensify further. The pair could then start its decline toward the pattern target at $31,653.73. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($52,265) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the oversold territory indicate the bears have the upper hand.Any pullback is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the stiff overhead resistance at $60,000.Ether (ETH) is correcting the sharp uptrend of the past few days. The price dipped below the 20-day EMA ($3,431) today but the bulls are trying to arrest the decline near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,195.98.If the price rebounds off the current level and rises above $3,600, the bulls will try to push the price to $4,200. However, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has dropped near the midpoint, suggesting the bullish momentum may be weakening.If the buyers fail to defend the $3,195.98 support, the decline could extend to the next support at the 50-day simple moving average ($2,709). Such a deep fall is likely to delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend. Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the 50-day SMA ($520) for the first time since Dec. 13. The 20-day EMA ($585) has started to turn down and the RSI has slipped below 42, suggesting the bears are trying to gain the upper hand.If the current recovery turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders are closing their positions on rallies. That will increase the possibility of a break below $480. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair may drop to $428 and then to $348.70.The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above $615. Such a move will suggest that the correction is over and the pair may be ready to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $691.77 could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $796.64.Cardano (ADA) is in a strong uptrend. It reached a new all-time high at $2.34 on May 16 where profit-booking set in. If the price breaks below $1.95, the altcoin may drop to the 20-day EMA ($1.71).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. On the contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that supply exceeds demand and that may pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.39).Instead, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $2.34, the ADA/USDT pair may resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $2.82 and then $3. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 63 indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.46). If they succeed, Dogecoin (DOGE) could move up to $0.59 where the bulls are likely to encounter stiff resistance from the bears.If the price turns down from $0.59, the possibility of a break below the 20-day EMA increases. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $0.35. A strong rebound off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $0.35 and $0.59 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls drive the price above $0.59, the pair may retest the all-time high at $0.73. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $0.83 and then $1. The bulls purchased the dip to the support line of the symmetrical triangle today, indicating buying at lower levels. The buyers will now try to propel XRP above the resistance line of the triangle.If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to the 52-week high at $1.96.This level may act as stiff resistance but if the bulls can overcome it, the pair may rally to $2.68.The flat 20-day EMA ($1.43) and the RSI above 53 do not signal a clear advantage to the bulls. If the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the pair may extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the price breaks below the triangle. That could result in a decline to $0.88.Polkadot (DOT) broke out of the $44 overhead resistance on May 14 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The bears pulled the price back below the breakout level at $44 on May 15.The 20-day EMA ($39.34) is flattening out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.A break below $32.50 could open the gates for a decline to the critical support at $26.50. A bounce off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels.On the other hand, if the price rises from the current level and breaks above $44, it will suggest that sentiment remains positive and the bulls continue to buy at lower levels. That will increase the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $49.78. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke and closed below the 20-day EMA ($1,178) on May 15. The bulls attempted to push the price back above the 20-day EMA on May 16 but failed to sustain the higher levels. This led to further selling today and the price dipped to the psychological level at $1,000.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at $1,000. However, any relief rally from the current level is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1,170) and then at $1,362.74.If the price turns down from this level, the BCH/USDT pair may remain range-bound for a few days.This neutral view will invalidate if the pair continues lower and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($922). Such a move could open the doors for a further decline to $700. The trend may favor the bulls on a break and close above $1,362.74.The failure of the bulls to build upon the breakout of the ascending broadening wedge formation could have attracted aggressive profit-booking from short-term traders. This pulled Litecoin (LTC) to the 20-day EMA ($308) on May 12.Although the bulls attempted a recovery on May 13 and 14, the rebound fizzled out at $339.10. The selling resumed on May 15 and sent the LTC/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA.Today, the bulls are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA ($270). However, the 20-day EMA has started to slope down and the RSI is below 45, suggesting the bears are trying to make a comeback.If the pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, the selling could intensify and the pair may drop to the support line of the wedge. This negative view will be negated if the bulls push the price above $340.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the support line of the ascending channel today but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back into the channel. However, the 20-day EMA ($37.72) has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative territory, suggesting the bears have a slight advantage. If the price closes below the channel, it will indicate a possible change in trend.The UNI/USDT pair could then drop to the $27.50 to $25 support zone and then to $20. This negative view will invalidate if the buyers propel the price above $40.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-17,"  Transaction fees are falling rapidly on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the coin prices of both recede from recent peaks. Transaction fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum have fallen by 81% and 71%, respectively, over the last few weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market continues to descend from its recent all-time high.The average cost of using the Ethereum blockchain fell from $69.92 per transaction on Wednesday to $20.06 by Sunday, according to data from Bitinfocharts. In the same time period, Ether’s (ETH) spot price both peaked and crashed, falling from an all-time high of $4,358 on Wednesday to $3,183 just prior to publication — a 27% decline.Before 2021’s market surge, Ethereum’s current average fee of $20 would have been an all-time high by some margin. As recently as 2020, average usage costs were lower than $0.10. The rapid surge in the cost of using Ethereum comes after the emergence of decentralized finance apps — which now make up four out of the top five gas burners on the blockchain — and the increased attention brought to the blockchain amid 2021’s market boom. Ethereum’s daily user count has quadrupled since the beginning of 2020, climbing from around 400,000 to 1.6 million according to Bitinfocharts. This number does not account for transactions taking place on Ethereum’s layer-two protocols.A similar trend was observed on Bitcoin, which saw its transaction fees fall 81% since mid-April when the BTC coin price was close to $65,000. Average transaction costs of around $62.77 marked a new all-time high for BTC, exceeding 2017’s high of $55, which signaled the top of Bitcoin’s bull run at the time.Bitcoin was priced at $42,440 early on Monday morning, marking a 34% decline since April’s recent peak. Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s share of the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization, fell as low as 39.9% on Monday, sinking from a high of 70% in December. While generally indicative of a swelling altcoin market, this figure can also be misleading due to the difference in the size of the crypto market cap at various times. For example, in 2017, Bitcoin’s market dominance was close to 90%, but the global market cap was only $2 billion, or 0.1% of what it is now. At the same time, the global market cap figure can easily be boosted by anyone who can be bothered to launch an arbitrary token with a high supply and even just a modest starting price."
2021-05-16,"  Bitcoin price remains under pressure but select altcoins like XRP, DOT, XLM and SOL are showing signs of resuming their uptrend. Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to rise above the $50,000 mark, which could have resulted in traders dumping their Bitcoin positions to invest in altcoins. Glassnode data suggests that whale addresses owning more than 1,000 BTC have reduced from about 2,500 in February to 2,100.If large investors continue to sell, Bitcoin could witness a sharp correction until institutional investors step in and buy at lower levels. While MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 271 Bitcoin on May 13, other existing institutional investors appear to be adopting a wait and watch approach.In an interview with Financial NewsSquare, Square chief financial officer Amrita Ahuja said, at this point, the firm does not have any plans to add Bitcoin to its existing haul of roughly 8,027 Bitcoin purchased in October 2020 and February of this year.If other institutions also stay away from buying at current levels, Bitcoin’s price is likely to slide further. However, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner Tom Lee believes Bitcoin’s rally still has legs. Lee has increased his year-end Bitcoin target from $100,000 to $125,000.With action becoming coin specific, let’s look at the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may lead the charge in the next few days.The bulls again purchased the dip to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern today but the long wick on the candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels. Bitcoin’s sentiment seems to have changed from buy on dips to sell on rallies.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the neckline, the H&S pattern will complete. This setup has a target objective at $31,653.73. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($53,297) and the relative strength index (RSI) below 36 indicate the bears are in control.However, the bulls are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the decline in the $43,000 to $40,000 support zone but if they fail, the decline could be sharp.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $51,550, the BTC/USDT pair may rally to the 20-day EMA. A breakout and close above the $60,000 resistance will suggest the bulls are back in the game.The rebound from $46,435.02 fizzled out at the 20-EMA. This suggests the sentiment is negative and traders are selling on rallies to the 20-EMA. If the bears sink the price below the neckline, the selling could intensify.However, if the bulls again defend the neckline, the pair may attempt to rise above the 20-EMA. If that happens, the rally could extend to $51,538.22 where the bulls are likely to encounter stiff resistance.If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may consolidate between $46,000 and $51,500 for a few days.XRP is currently trading inside a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. If the bulls can drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the altcoin could retest the 52-week high at $1.96.A breakout and close above $1.96 could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $2.68. The RSI has risen into the positive territory but the 20-day EMA ($1.43) is yet to turn up, which suggests that bears are likely to defend the resistance line aggressively.If the price turns down from the resistance line, the XRP/USDT pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The pair could turn negative if the bears sink and sustain the price below the triangle. Such a move may pull the price down to $0.88.The price has dipped to the moving averages on the 4-hour chart. If the pair rebounds off the current levels with strength, it will suggest buying on dips. The bulls will then try to push the price above the triangle.Alternatively, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the moving averages, the pair could drop to $1.35 and then to the support line of the triangle. A break below this support could signal advantage to the bears.Polkadot (DOT) broke out and closed above the overhead resistance at $44 on May 14. The bulls continued the momentum and pushed the price to a new all-time high at $49.78 on May 15 but could not sustain the higher levels. Profit-booking has pulled the price back below the breakout level at $44.If the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will suggest buying on dips. The DOT/USDT pair could then make one more attempt to rise above the psychological level at $50.If that happens, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $63.68. The marginally upsloping 20-day EMA ($39.54) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price sustains below $44, the pair could drop to the moving averages. A break below this support could pull the price down to $32.50.The 4-hour chart shows the bears pulled the price below the 20-EMA but the bulls are attempting to reclaim the support. The buyers will have to push the price above $47 to regain the advantage. If they succeed, a retest of $50 is likely. On the other hand, if the price fails to climb above the 20-EMA, it will suggest a lack of buying support. That could pull the price down to the 50-simple moving average. The flattening 20-EMA and the RSI near 50 suggest a balance between supply and demand.Stellar Lumens (XLM) is attempting to start a new uptrend. The bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.61) on May 13 and pushed the price to a new 52-week high at $0.79 today. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick indicates profit-booking at higher levels. If buyers can sustain the price above $0.73, the XLM/USDT pair could rally to $0.85 and then to $1. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 63 indicate that bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the price sustains below $0.73, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will then make one more attempt to resume the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders are closing their positions in a hurry and not buying the dips. That could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.53). The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective at $0.90. The upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in command.During strong uptrends, corrections are likely to be shallow. Therefore, the current dip may find support at $0.72. A strong bounce off this level could increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend.This bullish view will invalidate if the price dips and closes below the neckline. Such a move could trap the bulls, resulting in long liquidation. The pair may then decline to $0.55.Solana (SOL) had been range-bound between $40 and $49.99 for the past few days. A tight consolidation near the high is a positive sign as it shows that traders are not booking profits in a hurry.The 20-day EMA ($42.86) is sloping up and the RSI has risen above 65, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can sustain the price above the psychological level at $50, the SOL/USDT pair may resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $60 and then $69.On the contrary, if the price fails to sustain above $50, the pair may re-enter the range and extend its consolidation for a few more days. This positive view will invalidate if the pair breaks below $40.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls pushed the price to a new all-time high at $52.60 today but the long wick on the candlestick indicates profit-booking at higher levels. The price has dipped back below $50 but it may find strong support at $46.A strong rebound off this level will suggest that traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend. The rising 20-EMA and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $46, the pair may drop to the 20-EMA. Such a move will suggest aggressive selling above $50 and that could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-16,"  After failing to reclaim the $50,000 level, BTC faces renewed selling pressure in the short term. However, short-term headwinds don’t negate the bull market.   Bitcoin’s (BTC) price slipped below $46,000 on Sunday for the second time in four days, raising the specter of a deeper short-term correction for the flagship digital currency.Bitcoin fell to a session low of $45,127.01, according to TradingView, before staging a modest recovery to around $45,400. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 5% on the day and over 20% in the last seven days. The selloff in BTC contributed to a market-wide correction for crypto assets, as Ether (ETH) fell 7%, Polkadot’s DOT declined 10%, and Binance Coin (BNB) edged down 3%. Market sentiment toward cryptocurrencies has soured in recent days after it was revealed that Tesla is no longer accepting Bitcoin payments for its automobiles. Headlines about a possible investigation into Binance by the United States Justice Department have also raised concerns about a potential regulatory backlash. Meanwhile, Caitlin Long of Avanti digital bank believes that Tether’s first-ever reserve disclosure has spooked investors. In a Twitter thread posted on Saturday, Long said Tether’s “probability of default [and] loss severity in default just went up” because of its credit exposure. Namely, almost two-thirds of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are stored in commercial paper.Despite all the noise in the market today, institutions are accumulating Bitcoin with ever-growing conviction, offering compelling evidence that the bull market is far from over. Bitcoin Treasuries, which tracks corporate and institutional exposure to BTC, reported Saturday that institutions have accumulated 215,000 Bitcoin in the past 30 days. That’s equivalent to roughly $10 billion. Institutions have accumulated 215,000 #bitcoin in the past 30 days.Corporations with Bitcoin on their balance sheets have generated a significant return on investment. As Bitcoin Treasuries reported on Wednesday, the value of MicroStrategy’s BTC reserve has grown by 2.3 times; the value of Square’s Bitcoin stash is up 2.1 times; and Riot Blockchain’s holdings have increased in value by 9 times. These figures have declined slightly amid the latest market correction. Institutions have been flooding Bitcoin for the better part of a year. These so-called smart money investors are one of the biggest reasons for BTC’s ascent from just $10,000 last summer to a high of around $64,000 in April. "
2021-05-15,"  Strategic investor Lyn Alden's outlook on Bitcoin remains bullish despite growing risks Strategic investor Lyn Alden is convinced Bitcoin has still the potential to reach $100K in the current bull cycle — despite growing uncertainty and increasing volatility. “We are seeing a lot of froth throughout the industry”, she said, referring to the latest rally in a number of meme coins such as Doge. “Those are kind of warning signs for the cycle”, she added.Alden said that with the bull run slowing down and growing risks of a correction, it makes sense for some investors to take some money off the table and put it into some other assets. “For people who would have trouble with drawdowns or periods of volatility, it can make sense to rebalance”. Overall, Alden’s position remains bullish given her confidence in the strong fundamentals of the Bitcoin network:Despite a number of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin this year, she doesn’t think Bitcoin is anywhere near losing its leading position in the crypto market. Most altcoins, she pointed out, didn’t manage to sustain the same degree of growth throughout multiple business cycles. “ I'd be more concerned if I saw protocols that chip into Bitcoin's market dominance in one cycle and then chip even more into it in the next market cycle”.Don’t miss the full interview on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!

2021-05-15,"  Bitcoin bulls struggle to push BTC price above $50,000, while ADA, MATIC and other large-cap altcoins realize double-digit gains. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to look for direction, but as this occurred, Ether (ETH) and altcoins bounced higher from the Thursday sell-off. Dogecoin (DOGE) shocked investors with its 47% rally that kicked off after Coinbase announced that it would list DOGE in the coming months. DOGE’s price also rallied after Elon Musk tweeted that he was “working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.”While many altcoins have seen double-digit gains during the recovery, the price of Bitcoin has continued to languish near the $50,000 level as whale wallets containing at least 1,000 BTC have declined by 4.7% compared to the previous month, indicating possible profit taking or a rotation into different assets. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that while the Bitcoin recovery has been muted, demand for Ether led to an 18% rally as the altcoin notched an intraday high at $4,173 on Friday. Gains in the top altcoin come amid mixed fundamental developments, with data from Glassnode showing that wallets holding at least 32 ETH have been steadily declining in recent months, which suggests that fewer people are interested in becoming “full validators” for the network’s upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain. While the debate about whether or not the market is officially experiencing an altseason rages on, one of its trademark characteristics is a sideways trading Bitcoin that leads to traders refocusing their attention on the altcoin market and leading to a decline in Bitcoin dominance. One of the breakout stars of 2021 is Polygon (MATIC), which has seen its price rally 60% over the past 24-hours to reach a new record high at $1.75.Another project whose price surged 45% from the lows on Thursday is iExec RLC (RLC), a decentralized cloud computing network that got a boost of adrenaline earlier in the week after Coinbase revealed that it would list the token. Other notable performances include an 80% increase in the price of Ergo (ERG) and a 48% increase in the price of Sora (XOR), which lifted the token’s price back above $800. The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.307 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 40.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-05-14,"  Bitcoin is showing signs of topping out but many altcoins remain strong, a signal that the decoupling between the two is likely to continue for a few more days.  The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dipped to levels not seen since April 2020, indicating that traders are nervous about Tesla backtracking on accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments, Bitcoin's multi-week technical weakness and U.S. regulator's supposed investigation into the business operations of Binance exchange. This nervousness also led to a massive inflow of 30,000 Bitcoin to the exchanges, the highest number since the March 2020 crash. This suggests some traders are booking profits on their long positions. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that whales have continued to send more coins to exchanges than usual, implying that near-term bearishness may not be over yet.However, popular statistician Willy Woo believes that recovery after the Elon Dump has started and analyst William Clemente also painted a positive picture as he said that “Bitcoin held up very well” given the “largest day of exchange inflows since the March crash last year”.The short-term picture is uncertain with analysts divided in their opinions, but what does the long-term picture project? Let’s analyze the weekly charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin’s uptrend has been facing stiff resistance at the 100% Fibonacci extension level at $60,959.64. Although the bulls had pushed the price above this resistance, they could not sustain the breakout, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels.The BTC/USDT pair has formed a head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below the neckline. If that happens, the pair could drop toward the pattern target at $28,939, which is just above the 50-week simple moving average ($27,335).The 20-week exponential moving average ($47,444) is flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a negative divergence, indicating signs of weakening momentum.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls drive the price above the $60,000 to $64,849.27 resistance zone. The pair could then rally to the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $80,803.39.Ether (ETH) has been in a strong uptrend but the large moves in the past two weeks indicate frenzied buying, which usually ends in a topping formation. The RSI has risen above 88, indicating the rally is over-extended in the short term.The bulls are likely to face stiff resistance in the zone between the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $4,052.21 and the all-time high at $4,374.67.If the price turns down from the current level, the ETH/USDT pair is likely to find strong support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,195.98. Due to the uptrend, the bulls are likely to buy the dip and attempt to resume the up-move.If they succeed, the pair could rally to the psychological level at $5,000 and then to the 261.8% Fibonacci extension level at $5,759.94. Conversely, if the pair drops below $3,195.98, the next stop could be the 50% retracement level at $2,831.88 and then the 61.8% retracement level at $2,467.78.The uptrend in Binance Coin (BNB) has hit a wall at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $680.03. However, the bulls are not willing to let go of their advantage as they have purchased the dip to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $513.45. This suggests the sentiment remains bullish.If the buyers can thrust and sustain the price above $680.03, the BNB/USDT pair could resume its uptrend toward the 200% Fibonacci extension level at $796.64 and then to the 261.8% extension level at $985.30.However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance once again, the pair could witness profit-booking that may pull the price down to the 50% retracement level at $458.37 and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $403.29.Dogecoin (DOGE) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few weeks. The large weekly ranges show increased trader activity as both the bullish and bearish moves are exaggerated.The long wick on last week’s candlestick showed aggressive profit-booking at higher levels. However, the bears could not capitalize on the opportunity and keep the pair down as the bulls bought the dips this week, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.When the bulls buy the dips and bears sell at resistance, the asset usually enters a range-bound action and the volatility drops. In this case, the DOGE/USDT pair may consolidate in a large range between $0.35 and $0.73 for the next few weeks.After a sharp up-move from $0.33 to $1.48, Cardano (ADA) had been range-bound between $1 and $1.48 for several weeks. A consolidation near the highs is a positive sign as it shows that traders are buying on dips and not dumping their positions on corrections.The ADA/USDT pair broke out of its consolidation phase last week, indicating that the bulls have overpowered the bears. The rally could now reach the 100% Fibonacci extension level at $2.14. If the bulls can thrust the price above this resistance, the next target is the 138.2% extension level at $2.60.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that the bulls are in control. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and drops below the breakout level at $1.48. If that happens, the pair could drop to the 20-week EMA ($1.06).XRP spent considerable time trading between $0.21 and $0.78. Generally, the larger the time spent in a range, the stronger is the eventual breakout from it. When the price broke above $0.78, the altcoin soared to $1.96 within two weeks. However, vertical rallies are rarely sustainable and that is what happened. Since reaching a high of $1.96, the XRP/USDT pair has been witnessing volatile moves, which has resulted in the formation of a symmetrical triangle.After the large range moves of the past few weeks, the volatility is likely to drop and the pair may enter a tight range trading once again. The rising 20-week EMA and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand.If buyers thrust the price above $1.76, the pair may rally to $1.96 and then resume the uptrend that may reach $2.63. This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below $1.20. This could pull the price down to $1 and then to the breakout level at $0.78.Polkadot (DOT) has been consolidating between $26.50 and $44 for the past few weeks. Several attempts by the bulls to resume the uptrend failed to attract buyers at higher levels. Due to that, the price again re-entered the range.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to drop below $26.50. This suggests accumulation at lower levels.If buyers propel the price above the $44 to $48.36 resistance zone, the DOT/USDT pair may resume its uptrend and march toward the target objective at $63.68. The rising 20-week EMA ($30) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the bulls are in command.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and plummets below $26.50. Such a move could signal the start of a downtrend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been consistently making higher highs and higher lows for the past few months, indicating an uptrend. The altcoin has been facing profit-booking above $1,430 as seen from the long wick on the previous week and this week’s candlestick.However, a minor positive is that the bulls purchased the drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,113.61 this week. This suggests that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.If the bulls can push the price above $1,430, the BCH/USDT pair could retest $1,638.08. A break above this resistance could start the next leg of the up-move that may reach $2,050.21.On the contrary, if the price turns down from $1,638.08, the pair may remain range-bound for a few weeks. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $951.60.Litecoin (LTC) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few months and it has consistently stayed above the 20-week EMA ($219). The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the bulls have the upper hand. Last week, the bulls pushed the price above the 2017 high at $370, which is a positive sign. The bulls followed it up with a new all-time high at $412.76 this week but they could not sustain the higher levels and profit-booking set in.The LTC/USDT pair has again dipped below the breakout level of $370, suggesting the markets have rejected the breakout. If the price sustains below $370, the pair could gradually correct toward the 20-week EMA.A strong rebound off this support will suggest that bulls remain in control and the pair may then gradually move up to $370. A break below the 20-week EMA will suggest a change in trend.Uniswap (UNI) is in an uptrend and it has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few weeks. Although the price had dipped to the support line of the channel this week, the long tail on the candlestick suggests aggressive buying at lower levels. If the buyers push the price above $45, the UNI/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach the resistance line of the channel at $56.50. A breakout and close above the channel could signal a pick up in the momentum and the next target objective is the 138.2% Fibonacci extension level at $68.89.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the channel, the pair could drop to $25 and then to $16.84.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-14,"  Glassnode data reveals that the number of Ethereum addresses holding at least 32 ETH has declined steadily in recent months. The number of Ethereum addresses that hold more than or equal to 32 Ether (ETH) has been declining, pointing at a possible lack of interest among traders and investors to become “full validators” for its upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain.At the same time, the price of ETH has rebounded back above $4,000 on Friday, while Bitcoin (BTC) tries to reclaim $51,000 following this week’s “Elon candle” plunge.On-chain data analytics platform Glassnode revealed that the number of externally owned Ethereum addresses (EOA) fell to its lowest levels in the last 17-months — to 108,915. As of November last year, the count was around 127,500.Glassnode analysts see the Ethereum addresses with at least 32 ETH tokens as “potential validators” on the Eth2 blockchain. In retrospect, staking in the upcoming Ethereum proof-of-stake protocol requires users to deposit at least 32 ETH to become a full node validator. In doing so, the ETH creditors will become responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain. The staking functionality aims to secure the Ethereum network while ensuring consistent ETH rewards for entities that stake their capital in achieving the mettle. It further signifies the Ethereum developers’ aim to make their public ledger cheaper, faster and more scalable for users — in short, ensuring a transition from an energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol to the proof-of-stake one following the community’s approval.The Eth2 smart contract went live on Nov. 4 via a “Beacon Chain upgrade” and sought at least 524,288 ETH to meet a so-called genesis threshold, the one that proves actors’ consent over Ethereum’s upgrade to PoS. As of Friday, 9:40 am GMT, the smart contract had a total of 4,563,074 ETH. A Kraken address became a full validator on the Eth2 network just 37 minutes ago from the time of writing.For many retail investors, becoming a full validator on the Ethereum network remains a tall order since it requires them first to acquire 32 ETH or $128,000 at today’s prices. The cost to purchase one Ether has increased by almost 900% since the Beacon Chain upgrade.The Glassnode data (see: first image) shows a stark correlation between the 32+ ETH holders and Ether’s spot price. They appear inverse to one another, reflecting a declining interest among investors to become a full node validator. Instead, they apprehensively want to profit quickly from the ongoing bull run across the cryptocurrency markets.But that does not mean Eth2 is lacking fresh staking interest. The project enables small stakeholders to pool their ETH holdings together via third-party services. In turn, the collective fund deposits 32 ETH to the Eth2 smart contract."
2021-05-13,"  News that Binance could be under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and IRS triggered a marketwide sell-off that saw Bitcoin's price drop to $46,000. Within the last hour, Bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped by more than 3%, extending the decline that started on May 12 and saw the digital asset drop as low as $46,000 on some exchanges.Initially, it was Tesla’s May 12 announcement that it would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment over environmental concerns, along with technical weakness and a nearly complete head-and-shoulders technical pattern, that pushed BTC's price down to $46,000. May 13’s bearish catalyst appears to be a Bloomberg Tax report claiming that the United States Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service are investigating Binance Holdings Ltd. for alleged “illicit activity.”While the investigation is unconfirmed at this moment, as the news broke, Bitcoin's price quickly dropped by more than $3,000 and currently trades at $47,300. From the viewpoint of technical analysis, the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern is now confirmed, and barring a bounce off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $42,600, traders may look for BTC's price to restest the $40,000 level as support. Below this, there is the 200-day moving average at $39,000, and in a worst-case scenario, $35,000 is the target of the head-and-shoulders pattern. Bitcoin's price may be revisiting multimonth lows, but a quick glance through Crypto Twitter shows that most traders view the current pullback as a ""buy the dip"" opportunity, including Micheal Saylor, who on May 13 tweeted that MicroStrategy bought another 271 BTC at an average price of $55,387. MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 271 bitcoins for $15.0 million in cash at an average price of ~$55,387 per #bitcoin.  As of 5/13/2021, we #hodl ~91,850 bitcoins acquired for ~$2.241 billion at an average price of ~24,403 per bitcoin. $MSTRhttps://t.co/EwZnRkAt6kThis is not the first time Binance has been accused of unlawful activity by U.S. authorities and regulators. On March 12, Cointelegraph reported that Binance was under investigation for its loose Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering procedures, an accusation that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said had “no teeth”The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-13,"  Time to buy or wait and see? Bitcoin may have further to fall, but long-term price trends are still intact. Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $50,000 again on Thursday as the fallout from Elon Musk’s criticism continued to resonate.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed BTC/USD failing to establish $50,000 as support after initially dipping to $45,650.Musk, speaking as CEO of Tesla, had claimed that environmental concerns meant that the company would no longer accept BTC payments. After a three-hour slow crash, BTC/USD then rebounded to near $52,000 before losing steam once more. At the time of writing, the pair traded at around $49,500 amid heavy volatility. As Cointelegraph reported earlier, however, Bitcoin price trends beyond the short term remained unchanged by Musk and traders’ responses to him. For popular trader Scott Melker, it was thus time to use an established method for determining when the price floor was likely to hit.For this, he used the relative stength index (RSI), a classic indicator of overbought or oversold areas.“I post this every time 4 hour RSI goes oversold and it works more times than not. An overbought bear div was the top,” he told Twitter followers. Thursday had already seen Bitcoin cancel its downtrend when it encountered the 21-week exponential moving average (21EMA). This line in the sand had held throughout the past year’s bull market and that of 2017 and is thought to provide reliable support for periods where bullish momentum sees a short-term retracement.The 21EMA was still rising steeply this month, demanding that BTC/USD thus returns to setting higher highs and higher lows on weekly timeframes in order to preserve its usefuless.Previously, a warning had given $40,000 as a potential low should $50,000 fail to hold.Meanwhile, as investors rushed to “buy the dip,” attention turned to where large clusters of bids from whale buyers might also help buoy the price.Bitcoin had paid no attention to whale positions north of $50,000 despite plenty of buying occurring as high as $58,000. For monitoring resource Whalemap, however, the number of coins being transacted at a loss suggested that “panic” was already visible on the market even before the Musk episode.“These moments have historically been good buying opportunities as they indicate panic on the market,” part of a tweet on Tuesday explained.A look at buy and sell order configurations on Binance additionally showed retail investors now protecting $45,000, with $55,000 and upward becoming strong resistance."
2021-05-12,"  Bitcoin shed nearly 6% in an hour after Tesla suspended its support for payments in BTC. Bitcoin markets are pulling back after electric car manufacturer Tesla suspended its support for vehicle purchases using Bitcoin (BTC).In a May 13 tweet, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk noted the company’s concerns regarding the ""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.""While Musk predicted that cryptocurrency ""has a promising future,” he concluded that the rise of digital assets “cannot come at a great cost to the environment.""However, the firm has not ruled out accepting BTC again in the future, with the post noting that it will resume using Bitcoin ""for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy."" Musk added:On social media, many within the crypto community have contradicted Musk and Tesla’s assertion regarding the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, with The Wolf of All Streets host Scott Melker noting that ""Miners primarily use renewable energy.""However, while the ""3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study"" released by the University of Cambridge in October 2020 shows that up to 76% of cryptocurrency mining uses some renewable energy, it estimates that only 39% of the total power consumed by proof-of-work cryptocurrencies was green energy.As of the time of writing, BTC has crashed roughly 6% in the past hour, tumbling from $54,800 to roughly $51,600."
2021-05-12,"  Bitcoin adoption continues to increase but derivatives data shows retail and professional traders are reluctant to build new bullish positions. Bitcoin's (BTC) recent price action has disappointed most investors, especially when one considers that the total altcoin market capitalization rallied 24% in nine days to reach a $1.35 trillion all-time high on May 9. Bitcoin's 62% accumulated gain in 2021 has BTC traders feeling somewhat frustrated with altcoins and meme coins pumping to new daily highs.On May 10, Fidelity, a $3.8 trillion global asset manager, filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) request with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin (BTC) partnered with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the SEC's first response window will close in 44 days.On May 11, Palantir (PLTR), a $30 billion data analytics company founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, announced that it had started to accept Bitcoin payments. The firm is likely to follow in Tesla (TSLA) and MicroStrategy's (MSTR) footsteps by adding BTC to its balance sheet, and the firm could have more than $2 billion in cash on hand for investments.In other news, the proposed Taproot upgrade aims to make complex transactions cheaper, faster and easier to deploy. More importantly, this upgrade would bring some privacy to multisig and time-lock functions. Taproot activation will only be given the green light if 90% of all mined blocks include an activation signal ahead of August 11.However, despite all this positive news, BTC's price action has not taken its usual bullish turn. The most significant immediate hurdle appears to be the lack of a regulatory framework. Joanna Wasick, a partner at law firm BakerHostetler, told Cointelegraph: ""How many people using crypto for payments know exactly what the tax implications are of their payment transactions?""The first evidence that traders are in utter disbelief comes from the extremely modest perpetual funding rate. Futures contracts have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours to ensure no exchange risk imbalances. Even though the buyers' and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, their leverage can vary.When longs are demanding more leverage, they will be the ones paying the fee. Therefore, the current situation can be interpreted as bullish. The opposite holds when shorts are using more leverage, thus causing a negative funding rate.Take notice of how the current 0.02% rate, equivalent to 1.8% per month, is much smaller than the recent peaks. While professional traders tend to prefer the fixed-month calendar futures, retail dominates perpetual ones, avoiding the expiries' hassle. Therefore, this data shows that there is a lack of appetite since April 17.To better understand how pro traders are positioning themselves, investors should look at the options markets. Call options allow the buyer to acquire Bitcoin at a fixed price on contract expiry. On the other hand, put options provide insurance for buyers and protect against price drops.Whenever market makers and pro traders are leaning bullish, they will demand a higher premium on call (buy) options, which will cause a negative 25% delta skew indicator.A skew indicator between -10 and +10 is deemed neutral, which has been the case since April 15. This data is evidence of a balanced risk assessment from whales and market makers between downside and upside risk.In line with today's price drop, there is little evidence that option traders are bullish. This data also aligns with the BTC perpetual futures markets. Bitcoin has managed to close above $50,000 in 65 out of the past 66 days, likely creating a 'comfort zone' for bulls. Therefore, as long as this support stands, there is still hope that Bitcoin will notch a new record-high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-12,"  Ethereum puts in two USD all-time highs in a day, but in BTC terms, it still has a long way to go.  Ether (ETH) set a second all-time high on May 12 as the largest altcoin continued on its way to what analysts say will be $5,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked ETH/USD as the pair put in two all-time highs in a single day on Wednesday.Part of the now notorious ""alt season 2.0,"" Ether hit $4,350 earlier on the day, only to better its performance hours later and reach $4,380.Now under 15% away from $5,000, multiple commentators' forecasts of Ethereum’s native token hitting the landmark price level are in the spotlight. Among them is that of Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman, who in an interview last week highlighted data which suggested that a $5,000 ETH was a matter of ""if,"" not ""when.""Pechman said that funding rates had yet to catch up with price gains, and thus retail investors were waiting on the sidelines at price levels around $3,500. Institutions, however, were more active.""It tells me that pro traders have been bullish for quite some time — for a couple of weeks — but the retail traders are still waiting for a buy opportunity,"" he summarizedSince then, funding rates have increased only modestly, indicating that the market trajectory has even more room to continue. As Pechman and Cointelegraph noted, exchange balances of ETH are likewise falling despite the opportunity to realize profits. Part of their resilience may lie in entering trades long ago. Those using Bitcoin (BTC) to buy ETH at any time since mid June 2018 remained in the red at the time of writing — the ETH/BTC pair still had far to go to match its all-time highs.These were set a year earlier in June 2017 at 0.144 BTC. Wednesday's USD high corresponded to 1 ETH being worth a comparatively modest 0.077 BTC. ETH is now ~0.08 BTC and might even pump to 2017 peak levels of 0.12 BTC. But beware that after a pump altcoins frequently return to their normal BTC denominated ranges (or lower). #Cointegration #PairsTrading pic.twitter.com/fk36Yq6EcEEthereum has nonetheless outperformed Bitcoin with its gains throughout the past year, leading to increasing attention from mainstream sources, several of which have begun to school readers on the differences between the two largest cryptocurrencies."
2021-05-12,"  Bitcoin broke a $500-billion market capitalization in late December 2020.  Ether (ETH), the second most-valued cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC), has hit a major milestone amid the ongoing price rally.On Wednesday, Ether’s price set another historic record, surging to as high as $4,346, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ethers market capitalization briefly surpassed $500 billion, reaching nearly $505 billion on Wednesday.The new milestone marks Ether’s ongoing massive surge after it surpassed the $4,000 price mark for the first time in its history on Monday. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $4,317, up more than 6.4% over the past 24 hours and seeing massive gains of about 30% over the past seven days.Following the parabolic surge, Ether is now larger than payments giant Visa or major investment bank JPMorgan in terms of market capitalization. At publishing time, Visa’s market valuation amounts to $481 billion, while JPMorgan’s market cap stands at $488 billion, according to data from financial information website MarketWatch.Ether is the second cryptocurrency to hit a $500-billion market cap after Bitcoin. Ether took significantly less time to become a half-a-trillion-dollar asset. Launched in January 2009, Bitcoin took nearly 12 years to reach a $500-billion market capitalization in December 2020 at a price above $27,000. As the first version of an Ethereum cryptocurrency protocol was launched in July 2015, Ether is now five years and 10 months old.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin became a billionaire after Ether’s price rose above $3,000 on May 3. Megan Kaspar, a crypto analyst and co-founder of digital asset investment firm Magnetic, believes that Ether is now on track to hit a price target between $8,000 and $10,000 by late 2021. The analyst previously reportedly predicted that ETH would hit $3,400 when the cryptocurrency was trading about $1,200."
2021-05-12,"  New all-time highs for the largest altcoin combine with fresh bullishness across crypto after this week’s sell-off. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 4.3% on Wednesday as cryptocurrencies recovered losses despite increasing turmoil on global stock markets.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD erasing almost all the previous day’s losses on Wednesday to trade above $57,500 at the time of writing.The move came amid concerns over froth in tech stocks, fueled by problems in Taiwan that saw the country’s equities index post its biggest one-day loss in history. Bitcoin and altcoins had sold off with tech stocks more broadly earlier in the week, but the latest macro dip failed to worsen their performance.Conversely, as has become a hallmark trait of an increasingly asymmetrical market, most major cryptocurrencies bucked the trend and returned to growth.“BTC is bouncing here and Altcoins are recovering strongly,” popular Twitter commentator Rekt Capital summarized on Tuesday as the United States Federal Reserve buoyed the crypto cause by refusing to suggest that economic interventions could be lessened. Previously, concerns had surfaced that Bitcoin could ultimately fall through $50,000 under current conditions, opening up the path to as low as $40,000.In a continuation of “alt season 2.0,” meanwhile, Ether (ETH) led gains once again, touching new all-time highs while maintaining support at $4,000. Gas fees, however, remain a headache for traders and Ethereum network users.Other altcoins also challenged record highs, among them Cardano (ADA), which, at the time of writing, was just $0.04 away from all-time highs of $1.83.Amid continued controversy over meme coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) was flat, while “tribute” coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost 23% to fall out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Weekly gains for the coin still stood at nearly 1,500%."
2021-05-11,"  Ethereum price soared to $4,200 but derivatives data reflects a decline in the bullish sentiment of Ether futures and options traders.  The last couple of weeks have been nothing short of astonishing for Ether (ETH), as the cryptocurrency hiked over 80% to reach a $4,200 all-time high. Even after a 7% correction, the gains accumulated in 2021 surpass 300%, and Ether currently holds a market capitalization that exceeds $450 billion.In the face of such a mind-blowing performance, neither the futures contracts premium nor the options fear and greed indicator signal extreme optimism in the market. This data will likely lead some analysts to question whether traders are losing confidence in Ether's future price prospects.Citing the rationale for the current bull run would result in a long list, including the CME futures launch, the European Investment Bank's ""digital bond"" sale, the Berlin upgrade, and EIP-1559 block-elasticity, plus the bullish expectations being forecast over the upcoming fee burning expectations.The fact that decentralized applications reached $90 billion in net value locked while crypto exchange Ether balances dropped to record lows adds additional demand for Ether and supports the current bullish narrative.Professional traders also signaled interest as Ether futures open interest rose above $10 billion. At the same time, VanEck's SEC filing for an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) further proves that the bullish outlook for Ether remains strong. To confirm whether investors' confidence dropped as Ether reached its all-time high, one should monitor the monthly contracts premium, known as the basis. Unlike perpetual contracts, these fixed-calendar futures do not have a funding rate. Therefore their price will vastly differ from regular spot exchanges.By measuring the price gap between futures and the regular spot market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market. Whenever there's excessive optimism from buyers, the three-month futures contract will trade at a 20% or higher annualized premium (basis).As depicted above, the current 23% annualized premium is below average and far off from the April 13 peak at 47%. Around that time, Ether had accumulated a 52% gain in three weeks as it approached $2,400.A 23% basis level flirts with extreme optimism, but considering the recent rally, one would expect a much higher number. Therefore, one should also evaluate how options traders are pricing the downside risk.To assess a trader's optimism level after Ether painted the $4,200 all-time high, one should look at the 25% delta skew. This indicator provides a reliable ""fear and greed"" analysis by comparing similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side by side. The metric will turn positive when the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. This situation is usually considered a ""fear"" scenario. On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of upside protection and points toward bullishness.The above chart shows the indicator at negative 10, which is considered a neutral-to-bullish zone. As it gravitates towards negative 20, it is usually considered a ""greed"" momentum, which took place on May 9 as Ether marked its all-time high.Both derivatives indicators sit on the edge of a neutral-to-bullish zone, something unusual after a steady and positive performance. Therefore, one can conclude that there is literally no 'over-excitement' from pro traders. Some might say it's a ""glass half full"" point of view regarding the potential buyers' leverage opportunity. However, the same data can be interpreted as a lack of confidence from pro traders, fueling bears' hopes of an eventual correction in Ether price. Unfortunately, there's no way to tell right now as it remains unclear how soon the Ethereum fees problem can be solved.he views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-11,"  Dissolving support at $50,000 opens up a path to levels not seen in months, warns Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani. Bitcoin (BTC) could see a price drop to as low as $40,000 if higher support levels fail to hold, an industry CEO said.Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Pankaj Balani, CEO of digital asset derivatives exchange Delta Exchange, warned that there is a danger of fresh significant losses for BTC/USD.Bitcoin shed around 5% overnight on Monday, the latest in a familiar cycle of dips and rebounds below crucial resistance, which begins at around $59,500.At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency traded at just above $55,000.For Balani, $50,000 now forms a significant line in the sand for bulls, and a failure to hold it would open up a new lower trading corridor with a floor at $40,000.Cryptocurrencies in general, he added, “should move lower” under such a scenario.The perspective jars with the more optimistic projections from data-based analytics this week. As Cointelgraph reported, whale buying was previously tipped to keep BTC/USD at a minimum of $52,000.A major cluster of support from whales — 120,000 BTC at $58,000 — nonetheless failed to stop short-term losses, leaving a question mark over the ability of smaller clusters lower down to do likewise.Cointelegraph additionally noted that exchange order book support only begins at $50,000, with few bids between that boundary and all-time highs of $64,500.Reacting to the latest price action, however, popular commentators were as cool as ever, noting the overall volatility of the market was very much acting within defined contours.#Crypto prices plummet to levels not seen since last week!!!On altcoins, a sense of a reset being underway was apparent on the day, with Ether (ETH) taking a breather after hitting new all-time highs repeatedly in recent days.Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?Fresh Twitter action from Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, had the potential to release a new spate of growth for Dogecoin (DOGE), which had paired almost a week of gains to drop to around $0.50."
2021-05-11,"  Glassnode asserts that Bitcoin investors have been converting BTC into Ether during May.  According to an analysis from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, the sum of Ether (ETH) on exchanges has fallen to its lowest level in almost two years.Glassnode estimates that just 13.3 million Ether is currently held on centralized exchanges, the lowest it has been since June 2019. As such, centralized platforms hold roughly $52.4 billion worth of ETH or 11.5% of Ether’s entire supply. #Ethereum $ETH Balance on Exchanges just reached a 23-month low of 13,384,235.936 ETHView metric:https://t.co/1dCpD2ey8E pic.twitter.com/FGZHqXr3PaThe number of Ether on centralized exchanges has fallen 30% in nine months since peaking at 19 million ETH during September 2020. A low balance of ETH on exchanges is typically understood to be bullish for the markets, as it drives a reduction in supply relative to demand on popular trading platforms. Dwindling exchange balances suggest long-term investors are moving their assets into secure storage or locking their funds up to earn yields through decentralized finance protocols or staking.In its Monday “Week On-chain” report, the data provider also noted that there has been some reduction in exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) in favor of Ether. Glassnode correlated the spending behavior of reasonably old Bitcoin unspent transaction outputs of between six months and three years, finding evidence that long-term investors could have been recently flipping into ETH:The report added that on-chain activity has increased significantly over the past four weeks for Ethereum amid Ether’s recent bullish price action. The total number of smart contract calls, Uniswap transactions and daily transactions have all seen notable upticks since the beginning of the year.Daily transactions hit an all-time high of 1.63 million this week, representing a 22.5% increase over December 2017’s previous peak.At the time of writing, Ether prices were trading at just below $3,900 — cooling from its recent all-time high of $4,220 on Monday."
2021-05-10,"  Ethereum's increasing dominance has kept traders focused on altcoins but Bitcoin's struggle to hold above $59,000 could send the entire market tumbling. The astronomical rally in Ether (ETH) is not showing any signs of slowing down. The bulls easily cleared the overhead hurdle at $4,000 today, which also pushed the biggest altcoin’s market dominance to over 19%. It is not only Ether that is witnessing sharp buying from traders. Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) have also risen new all-time highs, suggesting a broad-based altcoin rally. However, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have lost its momentum as it continues to struggle near the $60,000 mark. That has pulled its market dominance to below 44% for the first time since July 2018. However, the recent underperformance of Bitcoin has not shaken the long-term bulls. Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko recently said in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin will rival the “monetary value” of gold. “If gold’s monetary value is $4 trillion, then digital gold should move up to that total,” Yusko added. That means Bitcoin will have to rise to $235,000 in the future to fulfill Yusko’s prediction.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels.Bitcoin has been sandwiched between the moving averages and the $58,966.53 resistance for the past two days. This tight range trading suggests a status of equilibrium between the bulls and the bears.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $52,323.21. The bulls will try to defend this support and if they succeed, the pair could extend its consolidation between $52,323.21 and $58,966.53 for a few more days.The gradually rising 20-day exponential moving average ($56,611) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This balance may shift in favor of the bulls if the price sustains above $58,966.53. That could result in a march to the all-time high at 64,849.27. A break above this resistance may signal the resumption of the up-move. Conversely, a break below $52,323.21 may indicate the start of a deeper correction to $46,985. A break below this support could trigger panic selling.Ether’s rally has continued unabated. After forming a Doji candlestick pattern on May 9, the bulls have asserted their dominance today and pushed the price to a new all-time high. The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above 83.A deeply overbought level on the RSI indicates a buying frenzy as traders fear missing out on the rally. Generally, such rallies top out after the last bull has purchased. The ETH/USDT pair could rise to $4,528.97 and then to the psychological level at $5,000.The first sign of the bullish momentum fading could be a correction that lasts for more than three days. A break below the 20-day EMA ($3,173) will signal the start of a deeper correction.Binance Coin (BNB) rose to a new all-time high at $691.77 today but the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above the breakout level at $680. The long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.The upsloping moving averages indicate that buyers are in control, but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests the bullish momentum may be weakening. A break and close below the 20-day EMA ($599) could be the first sign of a deeper correction.On the other hand, if the price rises from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push and sustain the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair could embark on a journey toward $760 and then $808.57.Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a sharp dump on May 9 but the bulls aggressively defended the 20-day EMA ($0.44) as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick. However, the buyers could not extend the recovery today and the price has resumed its journey toward the 20-day EMA. The 20-day EMA is gradually flattening out and the RSI has declined below 58, indicating the bullish momentum is weakening.If the DOGE/USDT pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest strong buying at lower levels. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. This view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. if that happens, the pair could drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.38.XRP has repeatedly broken above the downtrend line since May 6 but the bulls have not been able to sustain the breakout. This suggests that traders may be using the rallies to lighten their long positions.The buyers will have to push and sustain the price above $1.66 to enhance the prospects of a retest of the 52-week high at $1.96. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($1.45) and the RSI above 56 indicate a minor advantage to the bulls.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that supply exceeds demand. The XRP/USDT pair could then drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($1.16).Cardano made a large outside day candlestick pattern on May 9, indicating strong buying at the breakout level of $1.48. However, the bulls have not been able to sustain the momentum today and the altcoin has formed an inside-day candlestick pattern.If the bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will signal strength and that could enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. The rising 20-day EMA ($1.45) and the RSI in the overbought territory also indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. A break above $1.83 may open the doors for a rally to $2 and then $2.25.Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USDT pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($1.45), it will indicate a bull trap. That could pull the price down to $1.28 and then to $1.Polkadot (DOT) is stuck between the moving averages and the $42.28 overhead resistance. This tight range trading near the stiff resistance is a positive sign as it shows that traders are in no hurry to dump their long positions.If the bulls can thrust and sustain the price above $42.28, it will suggest that demand exceeds supply. That could result in a rally to the all-time high at $48.36 where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.However, if the buyers push the price above $48.36, the DOT/USDT pair could start its journey to $58.06.Alternatively, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair could drop to $34.36 and then to $32.56. If that happens, the pair may extend its stay inside the $26.50 to $42.28 range for a few more days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance near the 52-week high at $1,600.89 as seen from the long wick on today’s candlestick. If the price slips below $1,400, the altcoin could drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,263.10 and remain range-bound for a few days. The first sign of weakness will be a break below $1,263.10 and the advantage will shift in favor of the bears if the BCH/USDT pair slips below the 20-day EMA ($1,134).However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the price rises from the current level or from $1,400 and breaks above $1,600.89, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend, which has a target objective at $2,147.36.Litecoin surged above the resistance line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern on May 9, indicating a pick-up in momentum. The altcoin hit a new all-time high at $412.76 today but the long wick on the candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels.If the LTC/USDT pair rebounds off the breakout level, it will suggest that the bulls are buying every minor dip. That will increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend with the next target at $463.31 and then $500.On the contrary, if the price re-enters the wedge, it will suggest that the breakout on May 9 was a bull trap. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($309). A strong rebound off this level will suggest the sentiment remains positive while a break below the 20-day EMA will clear the path for a drop to the support line of the wedge.The bulls pushed Chainlink (LINK) above the resistance line of the ascending channel on May 5 but could not build up on the breakout. After hesitating for a few days, the bulls made a decisive up-move on May 9 and pushed the altcoin to $52.42.However, the bulls again failed to sustain the rally and the bears are trying to pull the price back into the ascending channel. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($43).If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls may make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. On the contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest the current breakout was a bull trap. The pair could then drop to the support line of the channel.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-10,"  Funds are ready on exchanges as existing whale behavior suggests that $52,000 is now the floor for Bitcoin. As Ether (ETH) passed $4,000 and multiple altcoins saw their own all-time highs on Monday, data shows that there is still more buying appetite to come.A trading frenzy is gripping altcoins, while Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate, showing signs that it is ready to tackle $60,000 resistance. While some alts, notably Dogecoin (DOGE), have cooled since last week, traders are far from exhausted and are ready for more. This is aptly demonstrated, analyst Lex Moskovski said, by the number of stablecoins entering exchanges.Stablecoin inflows have been on an uptrend for months, and apart from brief “reset” periods where they leave exchanges, the overall direction is clear.This suggests that traders are ready and waiting to enter positions in various cryptocurrencies at short notice. Stablecoin reserves across exchanges hit a fresh all-time high of over $11.5 billion in recent days, still above $11 billion after a small reversal at the time of writing. “Stablecoins on exchanges keep staying in the ATH range,” Moskovski told Twitter followers.Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on the composition of exchange order books, notably that of Binance, which reveal a lack of bidding interest above $50,000.At the same time, however, data shows that Bitcoin whales — large-volume investors — have amassed significant positions between $54,000 and $58,000.Compiled by monitoring resource Whalemap, the figures show that curiously, the largest cluster of whale coins in the range is 120,000 BTC at $58,000.Cryptocurrency traders are still sending stablecoins to exchanges in a sign that the bull run for many cryptocurrencies won’t end “any time soon.”“Whale accumulation clusters, NVT, on-chain volume profile and other on-chain metrics are showing $52K should be the floor,” the Whalemap team told Cointelegraph. "
2021-05-10,"  Bitcoin bulls face-off with altcoins after the largest cryptocurrency’s latest rejection at $60,000 resistance. Bitcoin (BTC) is off to yet another fighting start on Monday, hitting $59,500 — is this the week we see $60,000?After a promising but restrained weekend, BTC/USD is once again back to beating out resistance as major markets reopen.Given the strength of underlying technicals and buyer demand, bulls may have cause for celebration in the next few days. Resistance, however, has kept them in check for weeks.Cointelegraph presents five things that may help to shape Bitcoin price action.Stocks began on a familiar positive note in Asia as traders betted on existing highs continuing to hit.A fresh all-time high for the S&P 500 index last week ensured a buoyant mood, with the coronavirus pandemic doing nothing to sour what have been historic returns for various markets.Commodities were dictated by the ransomware attack in the United States, which pushed oil prices to three-year highs before the market calmed.“This interruption of the distribution of refined gasoline and jet fuel underscores the vulnerability of our national critical infrastructure in cyberspace and the need for effective cybersecurity defenses,” Bloomberg quoted a governmental statement as saying.The dollar suffered as the attack hit, with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) suddenly tanking in a move that boosted Bitcoin beyond $58,000.On Monday, with the pipeline still closed, only a modest rebound was evident, allowing the potential for further DXY-based gains for BTC/USD.As Cointelegraph often reports, DXY and Bitcoin tend to be inversely correlated, but this relationship has become more unpredictable this year.It’s all systems go for Bitcoin — at least when it comes to network fundamentals. Following the sudden hash rate dip last month — tied to miners being flooded in China — network strength and associated price performance have firmly recovered.The process was already evident last week, with commentators noting that the negative impact of the event was practically behind Bitcoin already.Now, however, forecasts reflect unprecedented interest and competition among miners, along with a firm commitment to the network’s future.According to data from on-chain monitoring resource Blockchain.com, the hash rate is now at new all-time highs, with its seven-day average going from 131 exahashes per second on April 25 to 177 EH/s as of Monday.Difficulty, which automatically adjusted downward to take account of the reduction in miners, is now also due for a major hike of its own when it adjusts again in around two days’ time. At 13.5%, the projected difficulty increase is the largest since June last year.If the old adage “price follows hash rate” proves itself to be as true today as previously, Bitcoin hodlers could feel the knock-on price benefits in the coming weeks. On the topic of price benefits, traders this week are looking for a “springboard” effect in BTC spot price action, which could lead to a breakout.After climbing and reversing but broadly putting in higher highs and higher lows in recent days, Bitcoin is due to make a more committed statement.On Monday, popular trader Crypto Ed said that a leg down from current levels near $59,000 should end around $800 lower before a resurgence takes out the pivotal $60,000 resistance zone.“BTC plan for today: Smaller correction after 5 legs up. Looking for a bounce and continuation up towards 62k and 68k after that. Potential bounce area (green box) = 58100-58200,” he commented on Twitter alongside a projection chart. The battle for final resistance near all-time highs of $64,500 has been raging for several weeks, with each attempt to overcome sellers ending in a price dip of various strengths.A look at the order book structure on Binance, the biggest exchange globally by volume, showed that the $60,000 zone was still holding on Monday, backed up by incremented sell walls below the highs.Buyer support, conversely, was only in evidence at $50,000, providing a wide potential trading range should BTC/USD drop again.Bitcoin may have to wait for its ultimate push to take out the highs — altcoins are already running hot this week. Led by Ether (ETH), Monday saw a return to form for the majority of the large-cap cryptocurrencies after mixed performance over the weekend.ETH/USD, ever the surprise, shot past $4,000 on the day, showing no signs of slowing as it hit new all-time highs and confirmed traders’ forecasts of an attack on $5,000. The largest altcoin’s gains were plain to see beyond simple price action. According to data from analytics resource CoinMarketCap, Ether’s overall share of the cryptocurrency market cap now stands at 19.1%.That market cap passed $2.5 trillion on Monday, while Bitcoin’s share fell ever closer to 40%.Crypto market value hits $2.5tn as #Ether hits record high >$4k. #Bitcoin’s price is currently ~$59k w/its dominance reaching 44%, lowest since 2018, while Ethereum’s dominance is at a record 18%. pic.twitter.com/vhI2I8QPPwWith ETH/USD up 31% in a week, other altcoins began to copy its success. Cardano (ADA) matched its gains, while Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both reached almost 50% weekly returns.High flyers from earlier were conversely much calmer, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) both flat after reaching all-time highs of their own last week.Escaping the short-term narrative just for a moment, meanwhile, produces a familiar sensation that all is well in Bitcoin.While altcoins boom on a trading frenzy, a slow but steady transfer of Bitcoin wealth from weak hands to strong ones is continuing, says popular statistician Willy Woo.Analyzing data late last week, Woo stressed that this year’s bull run is different to the rest — because speculative hands are not lasting long and seasoned hodlers are buying up the slack at higher prices than ever.“This cycle is different; the movement of coins to strong holders is unprecedented,” he summarized alongside the data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode.As Cointelegraph reported, the trend has characterized various phases of 2021 when it comes to BTC price.

2021-05-10,"  Morgan Creek Capital Management’s CEO predicted Bitcoin will soon rival gold by monetary value. Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko believes Bitcoin’s next market cycle could see the asset rival gold by market capitalization and trade for more than $200,000.While appearing on CNBC’s Trading Nation on Sunday, Yusko compared the rapid adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) to the growth of FAANG companies — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.Yusko’s price prediction is based on his assumption that Bitcoin will rival gold by “monetary value” — a concept derived from the gold standard, where a country's currency or fiat has a value directly linked to gold. He stated: “If gold’s monetary value is $4 trillion, then digital gold should move up to that total.”With BTC changing hands for roughly $59,000 and Bitcoin’s market cap at roughly $1.1 trillion at the time of writing, Yusko’s prediction suggests Bitcoin could trade for at least $235,000 in the future.The investment manager predicted Bitcoin will become the base-layer protocol for the Internet of Value, likening Bitcoin to Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP — the standard protocol allowing computers to connect and share data across the internet.When asked about other protocols or crypto assets such as Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) — which have all reached all-time highs over the past couple of days — he stated there is room for more. However, not a fan of DOGE, Yusko added:At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading 1.7% higher on the day at $59,200, Ether was at an all-time high above $4,000, but DOGE had crashed after tagging new record highs, following a mention from Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live."
2021-05-10,"  The second-largest digital asset doesn't look to be stopping its meteoric rise anytime soon. Ether (ETH) eclipsed $4,000 for the first time on Monday, passing the psychologically significant barrier on multiple exchanges, including Coinbase. The new milestone comes just a week after breaking $3,000.Last week, ETH overtook Bank of America stock as the 28th-largest asset in the world. But at $454.49 billion as of today, ETH has now eclipsed the market capitalization of consumer-staples giants Wal-Mart and Johnson and Johnson, and it is knocking at the door of JPMorgan Chase — the largest United States bank by assets under management. Part of the rise may be linked to increasing institutional interest in the asset. Last week, a CoinShares report said that institutions bought over $30 million in ETH at the end of April. Money managers are thought to now own $13.9 billion in ETH or ETH vehicles. Likewise, there have been significant strides in adoption. On April 28, the European Investment Bank announced that it would be issuing a $120 million bond on Ethereum, the world’s largest layer-one blockchain, in collaboration with major banking entities such as Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the growth of decentralized finance — one of Ethereum’s key communities and use cases — continues at a remarkable pace. However, the most bullish catalysts on the horizon are a pair of major infrastructure upgrades to the network: EIP-1559 and Ethereum 2.0. EIP-1559, now scheduled to be included in the “London” hard fork, will include an overhaul of the Ethereum fee structure and is expected to decrease gas costs significantly while also potentially making ETH a more deflationary asset.Eth2, in turn, will transition the network to a proof-of-stake consensus model, which is expected to decrease sell pressure and encourage holding the asset. The remarkable run has even prompted renewed speculation that there could be a “flippening” on the horizon — a long-anticipated event among the Ethereum community in which ETH overtakes Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization.

2021-05-09,"  Bitcoin is still stuck in a predictable range below  Binance Coin, Cardano, Litecoin and Chainlink have formed bullish patterns suggesting further upside in them. Over the past week, several traders bought Dogecoin (DOGE) leading up to Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live appearance as they expected a pump. However, the mention of Dogecoin during the monologue by Musk did not produce the rally traders were looking for and professional traders may have dumped their positions on novice traders who were expecting a breakout. Dogecoin dumped to an intraday low at $0.41 today, losing over 34% from the previous day’s close. Since then, the meme coin has been trying to stage a recovery and has risen to $0.54. The sharp fall in Dogecoin price shows that buying the hype, without any major fundamental reason, could result in stomach-churning volatility.On the other hand, Ether (ETH) extended its up-move further, faltering just below $4,000, while Bitcoin (BTC) again fell short of the $60,000 mark, indicating strong selling on every minor rally. A few days of range-bound action in Bitcoin is a positive sign as it may set the stage for the next leg of the uptrend.With Ether leading the altcoin charge, let’s look at the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the short term.Bitcoin broke above the downtrend line on May 8 but the bulls are finding it difficult to clear the hurdle at $58,966.53. The immediate support on the downside is at the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,387), the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $58,966.53.If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could start its journey toward the resistance line of the ascending channel at $67,000. The price has turned down from the resistance line on two previous occasions, hence the bears will again try to defend this level. The momentum will pick up after the buyers push the price above the channel.However, the flattish moving averages and the relative strength index close to the midpoint show a lack of bullish momentum. If the bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $52,323.21.A strong rebound off this level will suggest buying at lower levels and that could result in a range-bound action between $52,323.21 and $58,966.53 for a few days. On the other contrary, a break below $52,323.21 may open the doors for a fall to the support line of the ascending channel and then to $46,985 where buyers may step in to arrest the decline.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $58,966.53 overhead resistance. If they can sink the price below the 50-simple moving average, the pair could drop to $55,000 and then to $52,323.21.The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. However, if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above $58,966.53, the pair could pick up momentum and rally toward the target objective at $65,012.18.Binance Coin (BNB) is in a strong uptrend and the moving averages indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. Although the negative divergence on the RSI is flashing a warning sign, the setup will not come into play until the price retreats and shows weakness.If the bulls thrust the price above $680, the BNB/USDT pair may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $808.57. This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($592).If that happens, the short-term traders may dump their positions, resulting in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($466). This is an important support to watch out for because the price has not closed below the 50-day SMA since Dec. 13, 2020. A break below $428 may signal that a top is in place.The 4-hour chart shows the pair is stuck between $600 and $680. The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating the bulls have the upper hand. If the bulls can push and close the price above $680, the pair may rally to $760.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level and slips below the moving averages, the pair may correct to $600. A bounce off this level could extend the consolidation for a few more days.Cardano (ADA) had been stuck between the $1 to $1.48 range for the past many weeks, before breaking out on May 6. This suggests the equilibrium between the bulls and the bears resolved in favor of the buyers.That does not mean the bears have given up yet. They attempted to pull the price back below $1.48 on May 7 and today. However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls have successfully flipped $1.48 into support.If the buyers sustain the price above $1.74, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $2 and then $2.25. This bullish view will nullify if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA ($1.42). Such a move could trap the aggressive bulls, resulting in a drop to $1. A rebound off this level could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating the bulls are in control. If the buyers sustain the price above $1.75, the momentum may pick up.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair may drop to the 20-EMA and then to the $1.48 support. A bounce off this support could result in a tight range trading between $1.48 and $1.75. The short-term bullish sentiment may nullify if the bears sink the price below the 50-SMA.Litecoin (LTC) has been trading inside an ascending broadening wedge pattern. Although the bears have been defending the resistance line of the wedge for the past few days, the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground.If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $372.53, the LTC/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend which could reach $400 and then $463.31. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the resistance line, the short-term traders may dump their positions. That may result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($298). A break below this support could open the gates for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($247).The 4-hour chart shows the pair is consolidating between $330.50 and $372.50. The bears have successfully defended the overhead resistance and are pulling the price toward the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will make another attempt to resume the uptrend. Conversely, a break below the 20-EMA could pull the price down to $330.50. A rebound off this support may extend the stay of the pair inside the range for a few more days. On the other hand, a break and close below $330.50 could signal the start of a deeper correction. The first support is at the 50-SMA and then $290.Chainlink (LINK) is in an uptrend and it had hit a new all-time high at $51.96 on May 7. During a strong uptrend, corrections are shallow and the price tends to consolidate in a tight range before resuming the up-move.The long wick on the May 7 candlestick showed selling at higher levels and that was followed by an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 8, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($42) and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can sustain the price above $51.96, the LINK/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $66.74. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks the $46 support, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off this support will suggest the sentiment remains positive. However, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate the short-term momentum has weakened and a drop to the 50-day SMA ($35) is likely.The 4-hour chart shows the price has broken out of the $46 to $50 range. This suggests the start of the next leg of the uptrend, which has an immediate target at $54. The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is above 67, indicating the bulls are in control.However, if the price turns down and slips below $50, it will indicate the markets have rejected the higher levels. That may result in further selling that could pull the price down to the 50-SMA. A break below this level will suggest advantage to the bears.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-08,"  Ethereum and Dogecoin hit new highs as investors brace for Elon Musk’s SNL debut and Bitcoin bulls push the price closer to $60,000.  The crypto market has rallied into the weekend as Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shibu Inu (SHIB) hit new all-time highs as they lead the pack of altcoins up the market cap mountain. Much of the excitement behind Dogecoin's rally has been attributed to the upcoming appearance of Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and a Dogecoin advocate, on the popular Saturday Night Live comedy sketch show. Ether, on the other hand, continues to rally toward $4,000 as institutional interest in the altcoin soars and the approaching London hard fork have investors feeling extra bullish. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that after briefly dipping to a low of $3,418 in the late hours on May 8, Ether price regained its composure and proceeded to vault 13% to reach a new all-time high at $3,958. While some have been surprised by the bullish movement from the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it comes as no shock to Cointelegraph market analyst Marcel Pechman who recently detailed how Ether ""could easily sustain until $5,000.” Bitcoin (BTC) has used its time out of the spotlight to quietly climb higher with bulls now attempting to hold the price above $59,000. Dogecoin has emerged as one of the biggest mainstream attention grabbers in cryptocurrency history as scores of new users got their first taste of crypto trading from the popular meme token. The week-long build-up in momentum for DOGE led to a 25% surge in the early trading hours on Saturday that lifted its value to a new all-time high at $0.74 before profit-taking dropped the price back below $0.68. Thanks to the global attention that Dogecoin has attracted, a number of canine-themed projects have arisen, including Shiba In (SHIB), which burst onto the scene following a two-day rally that saw its value launch 1,100% higher to establish a new record high at $0.0000178.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.463 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 44.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-05-07,"  Altcoins continue to rally higher and Bitcoin's repeat tests of the $58,000 level signal that bulls are building momentum. Goldman Sachs has started offering its clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) trading through non-deliverable forwards, according to Bloomberg Law. Max Minton, Goldman's Asia-Pacific head of digital assets, said that “institutional demand continues to grow significantly in this space.”Even Citigroup plans to introduce crypto-related services due to the increasing demand from asset managers and hedge funds. Although inquiries about Bitcoin surged in August 2020, the investment bank has been slow to jump into the crypto market. Citigroup’s global head of foreign exchange, Itay Tuchman told the Financial Times that “crypto is here to stay and that we are just at the very beginning of the market.”Long-term investors view dips as an opportunity to build their portfolio at favorable prices. These investors seem to be using the current correction in Bitcoin to buy. Glassnode data shows that 12,354 Bitcoin were withdrawn from Coinbase, with the intention of possibly being held in cold wallets for the long term.While Bitcoin seems to be in accumulation mode, altcoins have continued their stellar run. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to ascertain whether the altcoins have room to run or is a correction around the corner.Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance near the downtrend line but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,036). This indicates that traders are buying on every minor dip.If the bulls drive the price above the downtrend line and the $58,966.53 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and challenge the all-time high at $64,849.27. A breakout and close above this level will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $52,323.21. A bounce off of this support will imply that the pair may consolidate between $52,323.21 and $58,966.53 for a few days.The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint indicate the likelihood of a range-bound action in the short term. The possibility of a deeper correction will increase if the bears sink the price below $52,323.21.Ether (ETH) remains in a strong uptrend. The correction on May 4 was short-lived as the bulls pushed the price to a new all-time high on May 5 and followed it up with another up-move on May 6. This shows the momentum remains strong and traders are buying on every minor dip.If the buyers drive the price above $3,607.14, the ETH/USDT pair could continue its northward march toward the next target objective at $4,528.97.However, after the recent run-up, the price is trading way above the 50-day simple moving average ($2,289), implying that the pair is over-extended in the short term. A break below the $3,165.30 support will be the first sign of a correction to the 20-day EMA ($2,886).A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips as they anticipate the rally to continue. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate exhaustion and result in a drop to the 50-day SMA.Binance Coin (BNB) remains in an uptrend but the negative divergence on the RSI signals that the momentum is weakening. The recovery on May 5 fizzled out at $656, suggesting that higher levels are attracting selling from traders.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($579), the short-term traders may rush to the exit. That could intensify the selling and pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($451).Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend. A break above $680 could clear the path for a rally to $808.57.Dogecoin (DOGE) is in a strong uptrend. The bears could not even drag the price down to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.49, implying that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.Buyers are trying to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the $0.69 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could start its journey toward the target objective at $1.05.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that traders are closing their positions on rallies. The bullish momentum may weaken if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.39).XRP broke above the downtrend line on May 6 and May 7 but the long wick on the candlesticks suggests traders are booking profits at higher levels. The bears are currently attempting to pull the price back below the downtrend line.If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($1.43). The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand.A strong rebound off this support will indicate the sentiment remains positive. If the buyers push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the pair may rise to $1.96. A breakout of this level could start the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.09). Cardano (ADA) soared above the $1.48 resistance on May 6, which signaled the resumption of the uptrend. The bears tried to pull the price down today but the long tail on the candlestick suggests strong buying near the breakout level at $1.48.The 20-day EMA ($1.36) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. The first target on the upside is $2 and if that level is crossed, the uptrend may reach $2.25.This bullish view will invalidate if the ADA/USDT pair turns down from the current level and breaks below $1.48. Such a move could trap the aggressive bulls and result in a drop to the moving averages. Polkadot (DOT) reached the $42.28 overhead resistance on May 6 where the bears are trying to stall the up-move. The altcoin has formed an inside-day candlestick pattern today, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for DOT on May 5, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for DOT flipped green on May 5 when the price was $36.18, well before the indication of any rally.Since then, the VORTECS™ Score has largely remained in the green and DOT rallied to $42.47 on May 6, a 17% gain in two days. A breakout and close above $42.28 will suggest the bulls have overcome the resistance from the bears. That could push the DOT/USDT pair to the all-time high at $48.36. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the start of the next leg of the up-move.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from $42.28, the pair may drop to the moving averages. A strong bounce off this support will indicate demand at lower levels and the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the pair to $48.36.The 20-day EMA ($37) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating a minor advantage to the buyers. This bullish view will nullify if the bears sink the pair below $34.36. Such a move could result in a drop to $26.50.After the strong surge on May 5 and 6, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently witnessing profit-booking. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,263.10.If the BCH/USDT pair rebounds off this level, it will suggest the sentiment remains positive and traders are accumulating at lower levels. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $1,600.89. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $2,147.36.This positive view will invalidate if the pair plummets and sustains below the breakout level at $1,213.51. That could result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,030) where buying is likely to resume. Litecoin (LTC) has been facing selling near the resistance line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern for the past two days. Although the bears tried to start a correction on May 6, the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.If the buyers can thrust and sustain the price above the wedge, the LTC/USDT pair is likely to race ahead to $400 and then $463.31. However, the rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above 74, indicating the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below $318.87. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($286). If this support also cracks, the decline may extend to the support line of the wedge.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from $44.90 on May 5, suggesting profit-booking at higher levels. The bears tried to pounce on the opportunity and sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($38.68) today.However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick indicates strong buying at the 20-day EMA. This suggests the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips. The buyers will now try to push the price above $45.If they succeed, it will signal that correction is over and the pair is ready to climb to the resistance line of the channel at $51.50.Conversely, if the price again turns down from $45, the UNI/USDT pair may consolidate in a tight range for a few days. A break and close below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign of weakness and that could result in a drop to the support line of the channel.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-07,"  The ""original"" Ethereum, despite its security issues, beats ETH as it ascends to USD levels never seen before. The “original” yet ironically ""wrong"" Ethereum and Telcoin (TEL) are leading a fresh altcoin surge this week. Bitcoin (BTC) fans are already calling time on the fun.Ethereum Classic (ETC), the pet favorite of Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert, is up 300% in a week. In the latest incarnation of the 2021 “alt season,” altcoins are passing the torch between each other as investors chase optimal gains. This year has also seen a curious shift in market focus from a token’s use case to the culture around it. This was epitomized with Dogecoin (DOGE), the high flyer of 2021, which has gained over 7,000% since January.Memes and other social triggers likewise seem to be driving progress in this week’s round of breakouts, with ETC exploding in value without any noticeable changes. TEL has benefited from a successful layer-2 migration.“Casino market hypothesis,” Blockstream CEO Adam Back responded during a Twitter debate about why the altcoin market was delivering such results.As Cointelegraph reported, Back had also referred to luck of the draw as driving DOGE’s rise in fortunes.Others noted that investment in ETC, in particular, may not only be short-sighted but dangerous: in its four-year existence, its blockchain has suffered multiple 51% attacks, pointing to a lack of security and resilience which is absent from Bitcoin and the “newer” Ethereum (ETH).Price volatility was also recorded, with ETC trading at a giant 50% premium on Coinbase as prices took off on Wednesday.Nonetheless, fans were unperturbed and appeared not to be in a hurry to exit their positions.Last week, dad told me he bought $ETC at $30 and I told him he bought the wrong Ethereum and there's no usecase or adoption at all.He sold it immediately after and it's now at $140.Gonna disown myself first before he gets to do it.Silbert himself reminded Twitter followers of ETC’s price journey since inception in 2016 — from $0.50 to over $180, and a three-year high against Bitcoin.Asked if he was “happy” with what had happened, Silbert said that Thursday had been a “good day.” ETC is now the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, having begun the year in 38th position. Spillover from increased interest in ETH is a constant topic when it comes to its legacy parent, with data from sentiment resource TheTIE showing that ETH tweet volumes surpassed those involving BTC for the first time.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is repeating moves of a different, less favorable kind as the week draws to a close. Having once again failed to tackle resistance at near $60,000, BTC/USD was back at $56,000 on Friday, having dropped to lows of $55,400.Despite the relative lack of upside, however, longtime market participants remain wholly signed up to the bull market mentality.“BTC, ETH and the whole market keep pumping and pumping, unreal,” Simon Dedic, managing partner at blockchain advisory and investment firm Moonrock Capital, summarized on Thursday.As Cointelegraph reported, many altcoins on the market longest of all have seen a return to form in recent weeks."
2021-05-06,"  The volume on Ethereum futures flipped Bitcoin's after hitting a new record at $10 billion, and derivatives data suggests further upside for Ether price.  In the past 30 days, Ether (ETH) price decoupled from Bitcoin (BTC) to post a 67.5% gain, while the leading cryptocurrency price has barely moved. Ether's $3,605 all-time high on May 5 was responsible for boosting the asset's futures open interest to $10 billion.This movement brings up some crucial questions as the dominance of Bitcoin's derivatives markets appears to be challenged at the moment. On May 4, Ether's aggregate futures volumes surpassed Bitcoin's for the first time in history.Volume data from Coinalyze shows that $2.6 billion CME Bitcoin futures traded, along with $1.1 billion in CME Ether futures on May 4. However, Ether's aggregate volumes led by $87 billion versus Bitcoin's $81 billion.Some might argue that volumes aren't as relevant as open interest, which is a fair assessment. Open interest represents the total number of contracts in play, regardless if they have been traded on a specific date. In that sense, Bitcoin still has double Ether's $10 billion futures open interest.The above chart shows Ether futures mind-blowing 117% increase in two months. It is also worth noticing CME's contracts reaching a $460 million open interest, a seven-fold increase since March.To assess whether the market is leaning bullish, one should analyze its premium. The premium measures the price gap between futures contract prices and the regular spot market. This indicator is commonly referred to as basis and should indicate a 10% to 20% annualized premium.The stablecoin lending rate is the main reason behind this discrepancy, as futures participants are withholding settlement by opting for derivatives contracts.The chart above shows that Ether's futures premium peaked at 45% in mid-April and has since normalized near 25%. This data is very encouraging as it signals that there is not extreme optimism despite the Ether price reaching back-to-back all-time highs. While some analysts will interpret this data as a 'glass half full,' others might say it represents a lack of conviction from professional traders. Regardless of the viewpoint, it is important to account for the impact of the carry trade, which negatively pressures the basis indicator. Investors aiming for a fixed-income trade will short Ether futures contracts while simultaneously buying spot Ether.Overall, there seems to be healthy growth in Ether's futures markets, regardless of how one interprets the data. As for an eventual Bitcoin open interest 'flippening,' this seems a long way from happening. Either way, the overall increase in cryptocurrency derivatives is beneficial for the market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-06,"  New allocations from big business come as momentum behind the latest altcoin rally seems to shift away from familiar names. Bitcoin (BTC) touched $58,000 on Thursday as the latest phase of its comeback seemed to come at the expense of altcoins.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD’s return to battle familiar resistance near old all-time highs on Thursday.The move builds on strength from earlier in the week. As Cointelegraph reported, Wednesday saw $57,000 and 5% daily gains.As analysts began to note, however, altcoins are facing increasing pressure from a newly invigorated Bitcoin, which just days before had been left in the shade by their performance.Thursday, thus, saw 4.4% growth on BTC/USD, while Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), previously the week’s high flyers, were both flat. Other altcoins did manage to deliver impressive returns and beat Bitcoin on the day, notably Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which were up 16% and 22%, respectively, at the time of writing.“Good start of the day: both ETHUSD and BTC bouncing from the expected levels,” popular trader Crypto Ed summarized about the state of the market.The largest cryptocurrency thus again faced final resistance beginning at just under $60,000. Bitcoin had benefited from a major United States bank adoption announcement, which was followed by news that the largest e-commerce company in Latin America, MercadoLibre, had added $7.6 million of BTC to its balance sheet.“As part of our treasury strategy this quarter we purchased $7.8 million in bitcoin, a digital asset that we are disclosing within our indefinite-lived intangible assets,” a filing with U.S. regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed.There are now six companies with at least $11.4 million in Bitcoin on their balance sheets, corresponding to at least 8,027 BTC. MicroStrategy, which only entered the market last August, is still by far the largest player with over 91,000 BTC."
2021-05-05,"  Bitcoin bulls have a $104 million advantage leading into Friday's $1.1 billion options expiry, but a favorable close depends on BTC price reaching $60,000. Bitcoin (BTC) entirely recovered from its recent drop that saw the price fall to the $53,000 support level. This move back to $57,500 relieved bulls from the negative pressure of the May 7, 3,500 BTC options contract, which represents $200 million in open interest along with a $1.1 billion options expiry.Today's swift recovery could have been partially driven by the news that New Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) partnered with Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) to create a framework for U.S. banks to offer crypto trading services. Patrick Sells, the bank solutions chief at NYDIG, told CNBC that several banks have already signed up for the program.Moreover, a Mastercard survey found that 40% of the 15,500 interview participants intend to use crypto for payments over the next 12 months. Additionally, it reported that 77% of millennials are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency.Whatever the reason behind Bitcoin's recent price recovery, bulls are now in a much better position for the May 7 options expiry.Options contract buyers pay the premium upfront and thus face no forceful liquidation risk. On the other hand, the call (buy) option provides its buyer with upside price protection, and the put (sell) does the opposite.This means traders aiming for neutral-to-bearish strategies will typically rely on put options. On the other hand, call options are more commonly used for bullish positions.Analysts could easily dismiss Friday's Bitcoin expiry as the put-to-call ratio is flat. This means the neutral-to-bullish and neutral-to-bearish options open interest is balanced. However, these options will expire in less than 38 hours, causing the $65,000 and higher calls to become worthless.The put options, a right of selling Bitcoin at $48,000 on Friday, are also worthless today. To correctly interpret the potential impact of the May 7 expiry, analysts must exclude the strikes that are too far out from the current price.The call (buy) options up to $60,000 total 4,950 contracts ($285 million), and if the price of Bitcoin happens to reach $64,000 on May 7, another 1,620 contracts will boost the call options open interest by $93 million.Alternatively, the neutral-to-bearish put options add up to 3,150 contracts down to the $54,000 strike. These currently present a $181 million open interest and would be increased by 2,800 contracts down to $50,000. This level would boost put options' open interest by $161 million. Although bulls have a $104 million advantage leading to Friday's expiry, this number would be greatly reduced at any level below $60,000. As the chart indicates, most call options (1,680 contracts) have been placed at this level. Therefore, bears have incentives to suppress the price below $60,000. At least until 8:00 AM UTC on May 7.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

2021-05-05,"  Bitcoin is trying to stage a comeback in order to catch up with the spectacular price action seen in Ethereum and other altcoins.  Dogecoin (DOGE) skyrocketed above $0.69 today and flipped XRP to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of over $88 billion at its highest point. Galaxy Digital recently released a report titled “Dogecoin: The Most Honest Sh*tcoin,” and the document highlighted the fact that no updates have been logged in Dogecoin’s GitHub repository since 2017. Even the blockchain’s network security is suboptimal with only 26% of the overall node count running fully synced notes, the report added.There seems to be a massive mismatch between Dogecoin’s fundamentals and its valuation. The meme coin’s rally is an indication that traders are driven by greed and such phases of frenzy never end well. When the bubble bursts, several investors will be left nursing massive losses.Moving away from the Dogecoin frenzy, the latest CoinShares report shows weekly institutional inflows of $489 million for various crypto products. Bitcoin (BTC) accounted for the lion’s share of the investments at $411.7 million. This shows that institutional investors are viewing the current weakness in Bitcoin as a buying opportunity. The total crypto assets under management is at $64.7 billion, having risen about $7 billion in the past six weeks. Will Ether (ETH) continue to pull altcoins higher or will Bitcoin make a comeback? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin plunged below the moving averages on May 4 but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. This suggests the bulls have not yet given up and they continue to buy on every dip.The bulls have pushed the price above the moving averages today and they will now try to challenge the downtrend line and the overhead resistance at $58,966.53. A breakout of this resistance zone will clear the path for a possible retest of the all-time high at $64,849.27.However, the flattish moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This could keep the BTC/USDT pair stuck between $52,323.21 and $58,966.51 for a few days.The bears may gain the upper hand if the price turns down and plummets below $52,323.21. Such a move will suggest weakness and that could result in a decline to the critical support at $46,985.Ether is in a momentum-driven uptrend. Generally, in such phases of melt-up, the asset may remain overbought for an extended duration and corrections can be sharp but are usually short-lived. After a one-day pullback on May 4, the bulls are trying to resume the up-move today. If buyers propel the price above $3,527.19, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to $4,528.97. However, the farther the price moves away from the moving averages, the greater the risk of a massive correction. Therefore, traders should exercise caution.If the price reverses direction from $3,500, it will indicate profit-booking at higher levels. The bears will then try to pull the price below $3,165.30, which could result in a decline to the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,731).A strong rebound off this level will suggest the uptrend remains intact. The bulls then try to resume the up-move. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest the pair has formed a short-term top.Binance Coin’s (BNB) sharp correction on May 4 attracted buyers near the $600 mark. This suggests the sentiment remains bullish and traders are accumulating at lower levels.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the buyers push the price above $680, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $808.57.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($567). Such a move will suggest that supply exceeds demand and the BNB/USDT pair could then drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($436).Dogecoin is in a strong melt-up. The bulls pushed the price above the $0.45 resistance on May 4, which resulted in a pick-up in momentum. The long wick on May 4 suggested profit-booking by traders near $0.61 but the bears could not maintain the selling pressure.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for DOGE have been favorable for some time.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for DOGE flipped green on May 2 when the price was $0.38, well before the indication of any rally.Since then, the VORTECS™ Score has largely remained in the green and DOGE rallied to $0.69 today, an 86% gain in about four days. The buying resumed today and the DOGE/USDT pair hit a new all-time high at $0.69. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels. The pair could now drop to the breakout level at $0.45. A break below this level could pull the price to the 20-EMA ($0.33).Alternatively, if the bulls flip this level into support, the pair may again try to rise above $0.69. If that happens, the rally may extend to $0.84 and then $1.Frenzied buying in an asset can result in strong rallies. However, traders should be careful and protect their capital with a trailing stop-loss because vertical rallies can quickly reverse direction, resulting in sharp losses.XRP dropped below the 20-day EMA ($1.39) on May 4 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This shows the bulls are defending the 20-day EMA. The price has reached the downtrend line where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the BNB/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($1.05).On the contrary, if the bulls thrust the price above the downtrend line, the up-move may resume and the bulls may try to push the price to $1.96. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Cardano (ADA) broke below the 20-day EMA ($1.29) on May 4 but the bulls defended the 50-day SMA ($1.24). The buyers are currently trying to push the price toward the resistance of the range at $1.48.The ADA/USDT pair is likely to face stiff resistance near the $1.48 to $1.55 zone. If the price turns down from this zone, the pair could again drop to the moving averages and extend the stay inside the range for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, the pair may gradually drop to $1.03. A strong bounce off this support will suggest that traders continue to buy on dips to the support of the range. Until the bulls push the price above $1.55 or the bears sink the pair below $0.98, the range-bound action is likely to continue.Polkadot (DOT) plummeted below the 20-day EMA ($36) on May 4 but the bulls did not panic and dump their positions. Rather, they bought the dip and have pushed the price back above the moving averages today. If the bulls sustain the price above $38.30, the DOT/USDT pair may rally to $42.28 and then to $48.36. However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This indicates the pair is likely to hit a wall at $42.28. If the price turns down from this resistance, the range-bound action is likely to continue. The next trending move could start if the price breaks above $50 or plunges below $26.50. Litecoin (LTC) broke above the $335.03 overhead resistance today, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. The 20-day EMA ($271) has turned up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting the bulls are in command.If the buyers push the price above the resistance line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern, the LTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $400 and then $463.31.However, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to stall the up-move at the resistance line. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could drop to $308 and then to the 20-day EMA.A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will then make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the wedge. After days of hesitation near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,012.29, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soared above the $1,213.51 resistance today, indicating the resumption of the uptrend.If the bulls manage to sustain the price above $1,213.51, the BCH/USDT pair could rally to $1,410.42 and then $1,710.39. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $1,213.51, the pair could drop to $1,050. If the pair rebounds off this level, the bulls will make one more attempt to start the next leg of the uptrend.However, a break below $1,050 will suggest that supply exceeds demand and that could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($926). Uniswap (UNI) rebounded off the $39.60 support on May 5, which shows the bulls are defending this level aggressively. If the buyers propel the price above $45, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The target objective on the upside is a rally to the resistance line of the ascending channel at $50.The rising 20-day EMA ($38.35) suggests the buyers have the advantage but the negative divergence on the RSI indicates the bullish momentum may be weakening.A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bears are making a comeback. The UNI/USDT pair could then drop to the support line of the channel where buyers may emerge. A strong bounce off this support will suggest buying at lower levels and the uptrend may remain intact. Conversely, a break below the channel will signal a possible change in trend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-05,"  Miners are returning to Bitcoin as difficulty drops and revenues reach all-time highs.  Bitcoin (BTC) miners collected $60 million on a thirty-day average time frame as of May 5, showing the first signs of recovery after last month's severe revenue drop that followed mass miner outages in China's energy-rich provinces.In April, coal mining accidents and subsequent inspections in Xinjiang lacerated energy supply to the regional cryptocurrency mining industry. That forced miners to turn off their ASIC hardware, which exclusively generates computing power to secure and put the ""work"" into Bitcoin's proof-of-work.According to data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin mining revenue fell from its 30-day average peak of $60 million — recorded on April 16 — to as low as $57.08 million on May 2. The resource collects miners' data from block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners.The drop in profits coincided with a decline in the Bitcoin network's hash rate, signifying that many ASIC miners went offline after losing their chief energy source. The total hash rate per second (seven-day average) plunged from a record high of 172 exahashes per second on April 16 to 131 EH/s on April 23, a drop of roughly 30%.It since recovered to 168 EH/s on May 5, indicating that miners are resuming their Bitcoin operations following a considerable mining difficulty drop four days ago.Bitcoin prices suffered significant declines following China's outages. The benchmark cryptocurrency was already correcting lower after establishing a historic peak near $65,000 on April 14. The China FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — apprehensively accelerated the sell-off, causing the BTC/USD exchange rate to plunge to as low as $50,591 on April 25.Bitcoin's price and hash rate drop occurred almost simultaneously, providing further evidence for a higher positive correlation between the two metrics.Simply put, the hash rate represents the computational power of the Bitcoin network. This means that the higher the hash rate, the higher the theoretical cost of ""attacking"" Bitcoin, making this metric synonymous with the network's security. Bitcoin's price has recovered to a little over $55,000 as of May 5, much in line with the hash rate, signifying that the network reset is helping to maintain the cryptocurrency's prevailing bullish bias. More upside tailwinds come from Bitcoin mining difficulty projections. For example, data from BTC.com shows it should rise by a modest 1% in the subsequent bi-monthly (or 2,016-block period) adjustment on May 13.The network difficulty, which shows how difficult it is for nodes on the Bitcoin network to solve the equations necessary for mining operations, had dropped 12.6% on May 2. That tends to increase margins for both inefficient and efficient miners, promising lower risks of a Bitcoin sell-off at the producers' end.Meanwhile, with an upside adjustment looking more likely and mining activity rising on the Bitcoin network, the long-term projections for the cryptocurrency remain bullish.An earlier report from Cointelegraph compared the correlation between Bitcoin's price, hash rate and mining difficulty, ruling out that the first has a lagging correlation with the latter two, despite the popular mantra that ""Price follows hash rate.""The BTC/USD exchange rate closed 2020 at $28,990 after Bitcoin's network difficulty plunged to 17.438 terahashes per second from 19.679 TH/s in the November–December 2020 session. The period also saw a significant drop in the hash rate but left Bitcoin's overall upside bias untouched."
2021-05-05,"  Bullish news kickstarts a lackluster Bitcoin after an overnight slump neared $53,000 and altcoins kept surging. Bitcoin (BTC) staged a characteristic comeback on May 5 as a day of losses turned around in a flash.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD passing $57,000 again during May 5 trading, with daily gains knocking on 5%.The move marks Bitcoin's second such ""comeback"" in a week. While the bearish trend reset, analysts were keen to see how much fuel Bitcoin had accumulated after dipping to near $53,000 overnight.For Philip Swift, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, fundamental indicators still point to a continuation of the longer-term bull market.""I continue to think that Bitcoin will not crash and is more likely to range before breaking out to the upside,"" part of a series of tweets read. Swift specifically noted that one tool, the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, had ""nailed"" Bitcoin's most recent all-time high of $64,500 in April. As Cointelegraph reported, the indicator has become increasingly popular for those tracking BTC price trends over successive years.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $57,200, ruminating after reaching local highs of $57,400.Hodlers thus received a welcome response from the largest cryptocurrency, which had spent much of the week being humiliated at the hands of a surging altcoin market.Among the astonishing movers were tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), the latter having laid dormant for much of the past three years since the end of the previous broad ""alt season.""Words of caution, veiled or not, were nonetheless not in short supply as Bitcoin proponents warned about the fickle nature of such parabolic altcoin moves.Bitcoin dragging all markets down as people flee to superior assets such as Dogecoin.Acting in Bitcoin's favor, meanwhile, was news that it would be supported by ""hundreds"" of banks in the United States in 2021, along with investment giant Grayscale becoming a sponsor of NFL team the New York Giants. ""What we’re doing is making it simple for everyday Americans and corporations to be able to buy bitcoin through their existing bank relationship,"" said Patrick Sells, head of bank solutions at crypto custody firm NYDIG — which is behind the scheme — revealing the scale of the rollout to CNBC."
2021-05-04,"  Gemini follows eToro in integrating Dogecoin, as Ethereum underscores altcoins' Bitcoin-crushing surge. Ether (ETH) hit $3,500 on May 4 as the star of this week's altcoin rally battled Dogecoin (DOGE) for returns supremacy.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed ETH/USD as the pair broke through its latest historic boundary and continued climbing.At the time of writing, the largest altcoin by market capitalization was in pure price discovery mode as it sought resistance above $3,500.The week had already seen new highs for Ether's price on a daily basis, with seven-day gains standing at 36%.Among analysts and traders alike, the sense of excitement on the day was palpable. ""I have been calling for $3600 $ETH for well over a month, but think it can go much higher,"" Scott Melker told Twitter followers.  Short-term price targets have called for $5,000, and while zooming out, $10,000 and even $20,000 are not unheard of targets, as Ether has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) in U.S. dollar gains throughout the past year.On May 4, however, ETH was not alone. After somersaulting off its own all-time highs last month, Dogecoin returned with a vengeance, abruptly crushing its personal best to pass $0.50 for the first time. Discovery of a new price ceiling was likewise still in progress at the time of writing, with DOGE/USD taking out $0.55 on the back of 38% daily gains.The move came as major exchange Gemini announced that it had integrated support for Dogecoin, a day after trading platform eToro announced the same.""Dogecoin is the people’s money. It’s organic, irreverent, and fun,"" co-founder Tyler Winklevoss commented.Bitcoin predictably felt the heat from the altcoin advance, shedding both market dominance and price strength to near $55,000 for the second time in 24 hours."
2021-05-04,"  Altcoins are outsmarting Bitcoin bulls, and on-chain indicators aren’t as green as they have been — are further support tests inbound? Bitcoin (BTC) is back testing lower levels after failing to conquer $60,000 resistance — and indicators suggest the downturn is not over.BTC/USD bounced off $55,000 overnight on Monday, hours after hitting local highs of nearly $59,000 in bullish early trading.With sellers still in place closer to all-time highs of $64,500, the largest cryptocurrency has a lot of work to do to exit its current broad trading range. One metric that may soon be causing problems for bulls is the overall BTC balance on cryptocurrency exchanges.While seeing a general steep downtrend throughout the past year, local spikes in supply — when traders send coins back to their exchange accounts for potential quick sale — tend to reflect a more selling-driven mentality entering.This is not the case for every exchange this week. According to data from monitoring resource Bybt, 16,222 BTC has entered global leader Binance in the past seven days. By contrast, institutional platform Coinbase Pro has actually lost 11,947 BTC, conforming to the overall trend.Yet Binance is not alone — OKEx, Huobi, Bitfinex and Kraken have all seen their BTC balances tick up in the last 24 hours.As Cointelegraph reported, a familiar face from sentiment changes past is back this week — greed.Tracked by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures trader sentiment using a basket of weighted factors, appetite for a sell-off is rising, even as price action is no longer positive.On Tuesday, the Index gave an overall crypto market score of 68/100, corresponding to “greed” being the overall mood driver. This is still below its mid-90s peak seen earlier in the year — a level that almost guarantees a sell-off — but volatility ensures that the ndex does not stay in the same zone for long. “Greed” can turn to “extreme greed” or “extreme fear” within days or even faster.On April 27, for instance, the Index measured just 27/100.Last but not least is perhaps the most conspicuous factor at play when it comes to problems for Bitcoin this week: altcoins.At first, it was Ether (ETH), which led the pack and outshined Bitcoin with its trip above $3,000 to all-time highs on Monday.Now, however, Dogecoin (DOGE) is leaving the rest in its dust, back above $0.47 after getting integrated on popular trading platform eToro.DOGE/USD was up 72% in a week compared with Bitcoin’s 3% at the time of writing.While altcoin surges come in bouts, the mood among analysts is increasingly one of a longer-term trend taking center stage before Bitcoin can claw back lost time — and market dominance.As Cointelegraph reported, one indicator even suggests that the combined altcoin market cap could explode by more than 27,000% by the start of 2022.“The next 2-3 months are going to be epic for alt coins,” the popular Twitter trader known as Johnny summarized to followers, also forecasting a near-term price target of $5,000 for Ether.Bitcoin’s market share is currently 46.3%, falling ever lower thanks to altcoin inflows."
2021-05-03,"  Ethereum and a handful of altcoins have charged higher while Bitcoin struggles to find enough momentum to clear the $58,000 level. Ether (ETH) has been the star performer among major cryptocurrencies in the past few days as its rally has continued unabated. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed the $3,300 today sending projects market cap to $381.6 billion. Ether has now become the 24th largest asset in the world, vaulting the project above blue-chip names like Mastercard, NVIDIA, Walt Disney, Bank of America and Home Depot, according to data from Infinite Market Cap. This strong performance in Ether has also brought back murmurs of Ethereum flippening Bitcoin (BTC).However, Ether has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to flip Bitcoin because its market dominance at 16.4% is much below Bitcoin’s 47%. Still, the rise of Ether is positive for the crypto sector because it is likely to attract the attention of institutional investors.Fund managers will find it difficult to ignore the top two cryptocurrencies as their market caps surpass popular Wall Street names. This could continue to attract fresh money into the crypto sector and boost prices higher.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine their trend and the possible target objectives.Bitcoin has bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,915) today, suggesting that bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will now try to push the price to the $61,825.84 to $64,849.27 overhead resistance zone.However, the wick on today’s candlestick shows that the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above $58,000. If the buyers fail to do that, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price below the 20-day EMA.If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could start a correction to $52,323.21 and then to $50,460. A bounce off this level could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Alternatively, if the bulls defend the 20-day EMA, it will signal strength. If the buyers can sustain the price above $58,000, the pair could start a gradual climb to the overhead zone. The next leg of the uptrend may start after the pair rises above $64,849.27.Ether had been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. The bulls pushed the price above the resistance line of the channel on May 1, resulting in a pick-up in momentum. Ether could now rally to $3,513. Both moving averages are sloping up suggesting that bulls have the upper hand. However, the RSI above 80 suggests the rally is overbought in the short-term and the ETH/USDT pair may soon enter a minor correction or consolidation.If the bulls do not allow the price to re-enter the channel, it will suggest that traders are buying on dips as they expect the rally to continue. Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $2,850, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,586).After forming a Doji candlestick pattern on May 1 and 2, Binance Coin (BNB) has resumed its uptrend today. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting the bulls have overpowered the bears.If the bulls can sustain the price above $639, the BNB/USDT pair could start its journey toward the pattern target at $808.57.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $639, the bears will try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($552). A bounce off this support will keep the uptrend intact.However, if the price drops below the 20-day EMA, the pair could decline to the support line of the triangle and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($421).XRP turned down from $1.66 and formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 2. That was followed by a Doji candlestick pattern today, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the XRP/USDT pair could correct to the 20-day EMA ($1.36), which is likely to act as a strong support.A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest that traders are buying on dips. If the bulls thrust the price above $1.66, the pair could rise to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $1.73 and then retest the 52-week high at $1.96.The marginally rising 20-day EMA and the RSI near 61 indicate the bulls have the upper hand. This positive view will invalidate if the pair breaks the 20-day EMA support. Such a move will suggest that traders are dumping their positions and that could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.01).The uncertainty following the inside-day candlestick pattern on April 29 resolved to the upside on April 30 and the bulls propelled Dogecoin (DOGE) above the $0.34 resistance on May 1. VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for DOGE on April 29, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for DOGE flipped green on April 29 when the price was $0.30.Since then, the VORTECS™ Score has largely remained in the green, barring a short-term dip below the 60 level. DOGE has rallied above $0.41 today, resulting in a 36% rally in roughly five days. The rising 20-day EMA ($0.28) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the bulls are in control. The DOGE/USDT pair could now retest the all-time high at $0.45. If the bulls propel the price above this resistance, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $0.65.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks the 20-day EMA support, Cardano (ADA) has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA ($1.27) for the past few days, suggesting the bulls are in no hurry to book profits. The altcoin remains on track to resume the up-move and reach the $1.48 to $1.55 resistance zone.The ADA/USDT pair may hit a wall at the overhead resistance zone as the bears will once again try to reverse the direction and keep the price stuck inside the $1.03 to $1.48 range for a few more days.The marginally rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 56 suggest the bulls have the upper hand. If they can drive the price above the zone, the pair could start its journey to $2. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, the pair may drop to the support of the range at $1.03.After hesitating near the 50-day SMA ($36.94) on May 1 and 2, the bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above it today. However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows the bears have not given up yet and are selling on every rise.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA. That could open the gates for a move to $42.28.On the contrary, if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA, the DOT/USDT pair may drop to $32.50. The bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively but if the bears overpower them, the pair could drop to support of the range at $26.50.Uniswap (UNI) witnessed profit-booking at $44 on April 29 and entered a minor correction. However, the bulls succeeded in flipping the previous resistance at $39.60 into support, which is a positive sign. The uptrend has resumed today and the UNI/USDT pair has risen to a new all-time high at $45. Although the RSI is still warning of a negative divergence, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($37.41) suggests the bulls are in control.If the bulls sustain the price above $44, the pair could rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel at $50. This bullish view will nullify if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then drop to the support line of the channel.After a one-day correction on May 2, Litecoin (LTC) has started its northward journey today. This suggests the sentiment remains bullish and every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls will now try to push the price above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $286.02.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could rise to the 78.6% retracement level at $307.58 and then to $335.03. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($257) and the RSI above 61 suggest that demand exceeds supply.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from $286.02 and slumps below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders are closing their positions on relief rallies. That could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($230).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,012.29 on May 1 but the correction was short-lived as the bulls purchased the dip on May 2. This suggests strong demand at lower levels.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows bears are selling on rallies above $1,012.29. If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $950.46, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($879). A break below this level will suggest the bullish momentum has weakened and that will open the doors for a possible drop to the 50-day SMA ($703).Conversely, if the bulls succeed in sustaining the price above $1,012.29, the BCH/USDT pair could rise to $1,100.78 and then retest the 52-week high at $1,213.51. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 62, indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-03,"  Ether's spectacular rise to $3,300 has rendered all of the bearish put options worthless ahead of this Friday's $470 million expiry.  On May 7, a total of $470 million in Ether (ETH) options are set to expire, and ""slaughter"" is really the only word that describes what is about to happen to bearish ETH traders.Currently, almost every single one of the 75,909 put (sell) option contracts will become worthless if Ether manages to remain above $3,100 until Friday 8:00 am UTC.Ether's growth has been fueled by the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has recently surpassed $60 billion in total value locked, according to DeBank. Yat Siu, chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, perfectly described the scene:Siu added: While this may have sounded futuristic one year ago, the Ethereum network opened the doors for these markets in a very short time.Regarding May 7's options expiry, the neutral-to-bearish puts currently have a $250 million open interest but tend to become worthless as the settlement day approaches.While the apparent put-to-call ratio favors the more bearish Ether put options by 13%, when analyzing the target price (strike) for those derivatives, the activity above $3,100 is nonexistent. Ether's 55% rally over the past 30 days caught bears by surprise as the protective puts mainly focused on $2,800 and lower.Bulls, on the other hand, are usually highly optimistic. The call option contracts have a 66,350 open interest, equivalent to $220 million. Currently, 13.5% of those neutral-to-bullish options contracts have strikes of $3,200 and higher.However, considering that the call options completely dominate above $2,700, bulls have incentives to positively pressure the price as the May 7 deadline approaches. Unlike futures markets, there are few benefits to rolling over contracts that are now almost worthless.As shown above, the $2,450 and lower-strike ETH put options are offered below $10 each. Meanwhile, some of them don't have any bids at all; therefore, for Ether bears, it makes sense to throw in the towel for this week's expiry instead of wasting resources to salvage the poorly cast bets.For those questioning Ether's current valuation, Cointelegraph recently showed how the cryptocurrency might be less risky than holding traditional dividend-paying stocks such as Roche or Procter & Gamble. Moreover, the spectacular growth of decentralized applications and daily Ethereum network transfers and transactions should fuel Ether bulls to aim even higher for the end-of-month expiry.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

2021-05-03,"  Fresh gains come as the weekend preserves previous performance and Bitcoin heads to $59,000 on Monday. Bitcoin (BTC) is challenging familiar but significant all-time highs as a new week gets underway, rallying to $58,000 on Monday.After a surprise rally on Friday, the largest cryptocurrency saw a slow comedown through much of the weekend. This turned on its head overnight on Sunday, however, and now BTC/USD is back fighting resistance near $60,000.Cointelegraph takes a look at what the coming days might have in store for Bitcoin price action with five factors that could help shape it. With various major markets closed for May holidays, there are fewer cues than usual coming from commodities and equities.Asian stocks tracked losses, fuelled by various issues including India’s ongoing COVID-19 debacle. At the same time, in the United States, S&P 500 futures are already recovering lost ground from Friday. Unlike Bitcoin, markets did not react well to rumors that fiscal support measures over the virus may be reduced by some banks — these were a key element behind the S&P’s record performance over the past year. In tandem with the move was a shift in the strength of the dollar, however, with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) seeing impressive gains after a month of descent.As Cointelegraph reported, DXY and Bitcoin tend to be inversely correlated, but last Friday proved to be another notable exception. BTC/USD climbed conspicuously as if out of nowhere on the day, passing $58,300 before reversing. A key topic remains inflation — senior U.S. officials believe that trillions of dollars in virus stimulus will have little impact on it, while others disagree. Another day, another blistering comeback for Bitcoin. Just a week after recovering from its dip to near $46,000, BTC price action is now making good on its further gains late last week. While the weekend was mostly lackluster in tone, Monday is seeing the kind of “buying frenzy” that arch-nemesis Warren Buffett has been eyeing on traditional markets.At the time of writing, BTC/USD has passed $58,300 — the site of an all-time high from February — and is now continuing higher, calming near $59,000.A look at buy and sell demand from the orderbook of major exchange Binance shows resistance is still strong at $60,000 and above, and bulls will need to knock down several walls of sell orders to break out beyond the current all-time high of $64,500. Another significant barrier is now $68,000. On the support side, the picture is less sturdy — $52,000 is the first solid level among traders, followed by $50,000 and $48,000.Nonetheless, appetite for Bitcoin could well be seeing a new bullish phase as stablecoin balances on exchanges fill up. Against huge “printing” of these assets, such a trend raises the prospects of significant buyer demand materialising, helping to boost spot price action.“Stable coins are flowing back into exchanges. You know what that means,” analyst Jan Wuestenfeld summarized.Friday’s gains were notably driven by “genuine” buying among spot traders, while leveraged trades actually declined.Another theory focuses on Bitcoin simply playing catch-up with a red-hot altcoin scene, led by Ether (ETH).The performance has defied expectations; ETH/USD is now above $3,000, having gained 28% over the past week compared to Bitcoin’s 11%.That predictably shaved even more clout off Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, which is now at 47.7% — its lowest since July 2018. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see $3500 $ETH this week,” popular Twitter trader Crypto Chase forecast, along with further upside against Bitcoin. On-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, meanwhile, saw strength in the decreasing network value to transaction ratio (NVT) on Ethereum, this corresponding to organic trade volume fuelling price gains. “As $ETH price reaches over $3,000 setting a new ATH, the NVT Ratio is driven back down towards this cycles lows,” the firm commented on an accompanying chart. Back to Bitcoin and its network fundamentals, which are still playing catch-up after seeing something of a “reset” over the past few weeks. This first came in the form of a brief hash-rate plunge due to flooding in China. Bitcoin’s network difficulty then began signaling a drop to accommodate the loss of participants.As difficulty adjusts every two weeks, it took until Saturday to kick in in real terms. The resulting 12% drop has been the biggest since last November. With that out of the way, however, the door is open for returning mining hash rate to up competition and return difficulty to positive, not negative, adjustments. It’s still early — current estimates still call for another drop, this time of around -7%.Hash rate, meanwhile, has all but recovered from its prior shock, standing at around 161 exahashes per second. Its peak, monitoring resource MiningPoolStats says, was 168 EH/s.With new gains comes a familiar shift in sentiment, and market participants are getting greedy. That’s according to the ever-popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which on Monday is back in “greed” territory after more than doubling since late last week. The Index uses a basket of factors to create a normalized score between 0 and 100 for how greedy or fearful crypto markets broadly are on a given day. Its score tends to highlight when a price floor is in, or conversely, when a sell-off is due. At 61/100, however, the Index still has room to grow before sounding a local top — “extreme greed” is not here yet. "
2021-07-29T16:18:43-04:00," #1 – If your coins are on an exchange, you need permission from the exchange to spend them. In your own custody, you can do whatever you want and pay whomever you want, whenever you want, at the fee you want.You will understand this if you’ve ever wanted to move your bitcoin from an exchange and you were blocked because you needed to provide more identification documents or prove your source of income. You may have been blocked because you reached a 24-hour limit of value you are permitted to withdraw. Your funds may have been unavailable due to unscheduled system maintenance. It is your bitcoin and yet you are in a powerless position.Bitcoin doesn’t actually care who you are or how much you are transacting. You can move 100,000 bitcoin and you’ll be free to do that without any resistance any time of the day, even on Christmas Eve, if the bitcoin was in your possession.#2 – Your coins might not really be there. What you see is a promise that if you ask for your bitcoin, they will give it to you. But if the exchange gets hacked or if the CEO fakes his death and takes the private keys or if the government steps in, all coins could go bye-bye.Newcomers log into their exchange and see “Balance = 1.0 bitcoin” and they think that is their bitcoin. It is not. That is a number on a screen. The bitcoin is on the Bitcoin blockchain, the global distributed ledger. The entity that can move that bitcoin from one address to another is the entity that has the private key that generated that address. The user of an exchange does not have the private key, the exchange does! It is their bitcoin. The bitcoin belongs to whoever has the private key. This is crucial to understand.The exchange just has a legal agreement that the bitcoin belongs to the user and they show the user their balance. But the user just has a login name, a password, and a promise. Not a private key.A little sinister trick that blockchain.com employs is a 24-word password to log in to the website. This LOOKS like a bitcoin private key, but it is not. It is just a website-password. Blockchain.com has the private key. This is quite misleading, and confuses beginners as to the true nature of how Bitcoin works.Many exchanges have been hacked and coins have been stolen from those exchanges:There is no way to tell if an exchange really got hacked or if it was an inside job from a rogue employee. The bottom line is: if they hold your bitcoin, you are trusting them to act honestly and safely.You might not trust yourself with self-custody. That is understandable. But it is your responsibility to educate yourself on self-custody or at least only partially-custodial collaborative custody. Most early Bitcoiners are likely sitting on a lot of bitcoin. They must step up and look after their coins. People brand new to bitcoin can store their initial small stacks on exchanges and it won’t matter too much. But you, you are early. You must take responsibility. All the information is available online and free.#3 – If coins are left on the exchange, they can engage in fractional reserve lending, effectively inflating the supply of bitcoin. If there is a mass withdrawal by the public, exchanges can and have gone bust if they don’t have the coins that were promised. Coins go bye-bye.Fractional reserve is the fraudulent practice for accepting a deposit, and then lending it out, but the depositor is given the illusion that their money is still available. Somehow this is both common and legal in the fiat banking world. If one bitcoin is deposited and then is loaned out, the depositor should not have access, similar to a term deposit. This would be full reserve or one-to-one banking.If the depositor requests their funds, then what is returned to them is another depositor’s funds instead and, in theory, no one is hurt. But if many people want their funds at once, then the obligations cannot be fulfilled.This practice not only inflates the supply of money but is a systemic risk.By withdrawing your coins, you eliminate the risk to you of a bitcoin bank run.Trace Mayer, a once loved Bitcoiner, started Proof-of-Keys Day, on the anniversary of the first Bitcoin block, January 3. It started a movement where Bitcoin users celebrate by withdrawing all their coins from exchanges all at the same time, putting stress on the system, to keep the exchanges honest. Any exchange that was running on partial reserves could be exposed if enough people participated. #4 – One day governments may outlaw withdrawals to private wallets, leaving your coins stuck and vastly less valuable. The real bitcoin economy would consist of the open peer-to-peer market outside of the exchanges while the coins trapped inside exchanges would be useless.I am fully expecting governments to make it extremely difficult or outright ban coins from leaving exchanges into private wallets. We will fight back, no doubt. But the effort by governments will be futile. Most bitcoin is not on exchanges. My estimate is that about two million coins of the 18.7 million mined are on exchanges.Bitcoin’s future is as peer-to-peer money, with most payments made on the Lightning Network. Coins on an exchange cannot serve this function. Exchange coins will always have a middleman that you will require permission from to make payments.Coins stuck on the exchange due to laws cannot be used as bitcoin is intended and they will be less valuable. If I offer a service and charge in bitcoin, I will only accept real bitcoin outside of exchanges. I will not take payment from trapped bitcoin to my exchange wallet. I will not be alone. Therefore, there will emerge a price difference between real bitcoin and IOU exchange-trapped bitcoin.#5 – Powerful people who want Bitcoin to fail MAY be naked shorting it on futures markets. If we, The Resistance, buy bitcoin and extract it from the trading pool, we will eventually enforce a decoupling of the price of paper bitcoin vs physical bitcoin.We are fighting the people who print fiat. It’s easy for them to naked short bitcoin and suppress the price because they can print money and therefore have no real risk. *Click here to read more about how naked shorting can affect the price of assets. Here’s why they’ll fail: there is an army of Bitcoiners, true believers, who are regularly buying bitcoin and withdrawing coins from exchanges. Most of the coins are off exchanges already. If the naked short attack succeeds in driving down the price, Bitcoiners will eagerly scoop up the cheap sats and remove even more bitcoin from the exchanges.Miners can somewhat replenish the supply of coins on exchanges. Currently, miners could theoretically dump 900 bitcoin per day onto exchanges. When HODLers remove 900 bitcoin a day, the price is relatively steady. Wild fluctuations in price can happen despite this, of course, as traders buy and sell coins between each other. But as more and more coins are removed and as mining supply diminishes (halves every 4 years), there will come a point when not enough bitcoin is available. This will cause a decoupling of the paper price of bitcoin on the futures market and real bitcoin that is demanded by HODLers or merchants.Be a part of the army to bring this day forward and make bitcoin successful sooner. Regularly stack bitcoin — Dollar Cost Average (DCA) — and remove the coins from the exchange.#6 Unless you take coins into your own custody, you will never fully appreciate how Bitcoin works.If you don’t appreciate it, you won’t buy enough of it. And this you will regret.You will need to learn more about self-custody and run a node. This will also blow your mind and get you closer to the truth of how amazing this technology is. You might even start using the Lightning Network and be totally obsessed. In a good way.This is a guest post by Arman the Parman.

2021-07-29T11:53:19-04:00," U.S. clients of Compass mining can now mine bitcoin directly into a Choice Individual Retirement Account without triggering a taxable event, per a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Under the current tax laws, revenue from Bitcoin mining is taxed as income. Currently, miners must also pay capital gains taxes when they are forced to sell some of their bitcoin to cover other tax obligations. Through mining in a Choice account, miners avoid taxes on their bitcoin revenue in the short term and potentially indefinitely, depending on which type of IRA they use. In the statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine, Compass explained: “Tax-efficient mining presents enormous benefits to retail miners and empowers them with another tool to mine even more profitably at a smaller scale.”Choice is an independent, qualified custodian regulated by the South Dakota Division of Banking and an offering of Kingdom Trust Company. In May, of 2020 Choice became the first retirement provider to offer a single account for all client retirement assets, physical or digital, legacy or traditional. The Choice platform currently hosts over 125,000 retirement accounts, with over $18 billion assets under custody. Compass mining allows users to effectively mine without worrying about the logistics of mining through purchasing and renting machines that are then housed, maintained, and operated on the client’s behalf. It is the fastest growing marketplace for average investors to mine profitably at a wide range of scales. Retail miners are provided access to the same high-quality mining hardware and verified hosting facilities as large scale industrial competitors.In July, Compass Mining reached over 450 petahash (PH) of hashrate across all its mining customers. The tax benefits of mining to a Choice IRA account are limited to retail miners who have purchased hardware through Compass. The mining payouts are then sent directly to the Choice account. Ryan Radloff, CEO of Choice commented, “Being able to purchase a Compass miner within your IRA and mine bitcoin in a tax-advantaged account is an incredible opportunity. Our entire team is excited to work with Compass and as the industry continues to evolve.”"
2021-07-27T08:30:52-04:00," The below is a recent edition of the Deep Dive, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.The short squeeze finally arrived. Late Sunday evening, the bitcoin price started to run and absolutely exploded higher, touching $40,000 on certain exchanges and hitting an unbelievable $48,000 on the Binance Perpetual Swap BTC/USDT contract. What was the reason for the move, and why was it so explosive? Let’s break it down. The first thing to understand is how derivatives work and how certain types of derivatives can affect the market. In last Friday’s edition of the Daily Dive, we covered the structural changes that had occurred in the bitcoin derivatives market since May. Specifically, the increasing prevalence of stablecoin margined derivatives. To quickly recap some of the important points from Friday’s report, there are two type of derivative contracts (broadly speaking): ones that use stablecoins as margin and ones that use crypto, or in this case specifically, bitcoin as collateral. It is advantageous to use stablecoins to long bitcoin instead of bitcoin itself because if bitcoin draws down while you are leveraged long, not only does your position take a hit but the value of the collateral you are using falls in tandem. This is a large reason that the May 19 sell off was so extreme. In The Daily Dive #024 A Dichotomy Emerges, we covered the divergence between the spot market accumulation taking place and the increasingly bearish sentiment and trading occurring via the derivatives markets, as funding was persistently negative for much of the past three months. “Derivative and futures traders are bearish. Bitcoin stackers and hodlers are bullish. An explosive dichotomy in the market is beginning to emerge.” Specifically, bearish bets occurring on Binance using stablecoins as collateral had been occurring in increasing numbers over the past three months.Leading up to May, traders were increasingly using bitcoin as collateral to long bitcoin. This can be seen in the chart below which shows the proportion of crypto/stablecoin margined futures contracts.This short squeeze is the opposite. Traders were increasingly shorting bitcoin using stablecoins as collateral (i.e. shorting bitcoin via futures without having the underlying bitcoin).However, slowly but surely, accumulation by sat stackers ate away at the free float supply, which eventually gave way to a short squeeze."
2021-07-26T15:03:12-04:00," Nigel Green, CEO of independent financial advisor and asset manager deVere Group, reportedly said that the Bank of England's rumored digital currency Britcoin, which aims to overtake Bitcoin, will backfire.Green's comments come after it was reported in April that the UK was considering implementing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) ""aimed at tackling some of the challenges posed by...bitcoin."" A month later, the Bank of England deputy governor said that the launch of Britcoin was ""probable.""But Green reportedly claimed that the UK central bank initiative might not only fail but actually help Bitcoin's adoption and price appreciation, according to multiple sources.""Revealing just how worried they are about the ongoing epic rise and influence of Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, the Bank of England is reportedly set to establish its own digital currency,"" Green said. ""If the Bank and government officials believe Britcoin will supersede Bitcoin, they are mistaken. In fact, it will have the opposite effect.""Green cited three reasons why he doesn't see Britcoin posing a threat to Bitcoin as genuine digital cash.First, he said that a central bank's mere action of venturing into creating digital money might help reduce people's skepticism toward the lack of paper cash. That, in turn, would help validate and propel bitcoin and its ""inherent values of being digital, global, borderless, quicker, and more cost-effective than traditional money,"" Green explained.Second and perhaps more importantly, Green noted the fundamental distinctions between Bitcoin and digital money controlled by a central bank. CBDC's, he said, ""will still be controlled and manipulated by the Bank of England, meaning they can adjust supply and therefore its value."" Something not possible with Bitcoin.Lastly, Green also highlighted how there is a growing mistrust of the traditional banking system by the ""younger, 'digital-native' generations."" Consequently, the generation immersed in technology might favor the truly peer-to-peer digital cash system.""Britcoin will be controlled by a handful of people from the Bank who have conversations and make decisions behind closed doors,"" Green added. ""Bitcoin is controlled by no one and discussions are held out in the open and decisions are transparent and community-based. Which one do you think is the future of money?"""
2021-07-26T12:56:51-04:00," Last Week In Bitcoin is a series discussing the events of the previous week that occurred in the Bitcoin industry, covering all the important news and analysis.It’s been quite the week for bitcoin. Elon Musk revealed that SpaceX, in addition to Tesla and himself, holds bitcoin with no imminent plans to sell. Jack Dorsey pushed a bitcoin positive agenda onto Twitter shareholders, recommending an “aggressive” approach to investing in bitcoin. Besides a lot of other news, the week ended with reports that Amazon would accept bitcoin payments before the end of the year, sending bitcoin on a run toward $40,000. All in all, not a bad week for HODLers.Besides bullish market sentiments, there are more than enough movements in the market to indicate an upward breakout is coming. Besides El Salvador beginning its nationwide rollout of bitcoin in September 2021, there is Tesla likely accepting bitcoin for payments again; Twitter and other companies’ “aggressive” investment in bitcoin; and rumors of both Amazon being interested in either accepting bitcoin payments or investing in it outright.Overall, it is likely that bitcoin’s current trajectory should follow the same path as in November and December 2020 given current developments. If that does in fact happen, bitcoin could very well breach $100,000 sometime in the fourth quarter of 2021, which means Christmas is coming early for hardcore HODLers and those who bought recent dips.Let’s start with the bullish reports that pushed bitcoin to $40,000 over the last few days. Amazon seems to be interested in integrating bitcoin payments into their platform, you know the global marketplace with over 310 million users worldwide. Should this pan out, and Amazon starts accepting payment in bitcoin, the market will react very favorably if rumors were able to push the surge on Sunday.Bitcoin warlock Jack Dorsey also indicated to Twitter shareholders that the company should “invest aggressively” in bitcoin. Interestingly, Dorsey repeatedly avoided Elon Musk’s questions about Twitter integrating bitcoin into its platform during The B Word earlier in the week which featured Dorsey, Musk and Cathie Woods.Speaking of The B Word, during the discussion, Elon Musk made two important statements. The first was confirming that SpaceX holds bitcoin on its balance sheet, in addition to Tesla and Musk himself. The second was that, although he “pumps” the market, he would never “dump,” leading many to take that as an admission that neither he nor his companies intend to sell any of their bitcoin holdings. With Musk’s epic trolling over the last few months, this was about as bullish as anything that comes out of his mouth.Finally on the bullish front, there’s FTX’s recent funding round in which the global exchange raised $900 million in funding, the largest ever for a crypto exchange, leading to an $18 billion valuation and reaffirming that interest from large investors in the crypto space is as high as ever. Bullish indeed.Last week, the European Commission proposed a law to KYC all transactions involving digital currencies in the European Union. If passed, this could very well negatively affect wallet manufacturers such as Ledger and Trezor, both of which are based in Europe. Although bearish in the long run, there are still some hurdles to clear for the law and it may not end up being passed.Luckily for us, there is relatively little bearish news from the week otherwise. Let’s hope it stays that way.Once again, I am still hyped on bitcoin’s future. In terms of fiat pricing, it’s going up over the next few months and will likely be fueled further with high inflation rates in the U.S. and U.K., further adoption by large corporations and an overall change in market sentiment.I firmly believe we’re in for a wild week in the coming days as the recent surge will either see a decent correction, or push bitcoin past the $40,000 resistance and back up in the mid 40s. Of course, nothing is set in stone and if you’ve been in the market for only a short while, its volatility and uncertainty can be a cause for concern.Hardcore HODLers and true bitcoin believers will agree that the way to approach bitcoin is with a long-term view. Short-term fluctuations are common, but, of course, had you bought bitcoin anytime in the 11 years leading up to 2021, your stack would be nice and deep in the green right now.Many would agree with me that we are still in the early days of bitcoin. So far only one of the 195 countries worldwide has adopted bitcoin and we’re still 119 years from the last bitcoin being mined. There are millions of companies that have yet to embrace the beauty that is bitcoin and billions of people to do the same.This is a guest post by Dion Guillaume.

2021-07-24T14:30:00-04:00," Bitcoin is king — it is still the best performing asset of our lives. It has silenced its harshest critics and only continued to grow in adoption, usability and relevance. The fact that bitcoin has achieved all this in only 12 years is remarkable. However, there is a very real specter that has been haunting the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception: speed. As adoption continues to bring billions in institutional money, retail, venture capital and now even entire countries into the Bitcoin ecosystem, we are facing the congestion and throughput problems many feared would keep bitcoin from achieving all its lofty revolutionary goals. Despite this, and even despite the rise of altcoins and the scalability challenges facing bitcoin, it will continue to build upon its successes and inevitably become the primary digital reserve currency of the world economy. How? With a bolt of Lightning.If a blockchain network cannot scale to meet the needs of the global, digital economy, there is no hope of achieving mainstream adoption. There are many measures for scalability, but the most common is throughput (transactions per second or TPS). For context, Visa's payments network can process an estimated 24,000 transactions per second, though in reality only needs to complete about 1,700/sec. By comparison, Bitcoin processes between four and five transactions per second—in other words, Bitcoin is painfully slow. Bitcoin's latency is in large part what motivated the rise of altcoins: Cardano, Nano and Solana, to name a few, all advertise high transaction throughput in comparison to bitcoin.Many Bitcoin users would argue that speed isn't the ultimate aim for bitcoin, whose primary purpose is to serve as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Admittedly, there is a real need for preserving wealth through time to dodge the ravages of fiat currency inflation that have wreaked havoc on countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina and Iran. However, Bitcoin purists never doubted that Bitcoin should also live up to the original vision of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system laid out in Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper.So, how does bitcoin arrive at this vision as a global currency and means of exchange, in addition to a store of value?The Bitcoin Cash hardfork was one potential solution to scalability: By increasing block size, more transactions could be included at a time. However, Bitcoin Cash can still only process a meager 116 transactions per second (it also failed miserably in the adoption test). Enter: the Lightning Network.The Lightning Network works by offloading capacity from the main Bitcoin blockchain onto a second layer of payment channels. Since Bitcoin's scalability issues are driven by the fact that each transaction has to be broadcasted to the entire network and included in the main Bitcoin blockchain, by utilizing Lightning Network, two entities can open a payment channel between them to enable instantaneous and frictionless payments. The only time transactions are broadcasted to the entire chain is when they open or close a channel. Lightning's real magic lies in the fact that you don't have to open a channel with someone in order to transact with them. The network knows how to send money across existing channels from sender to receiver. Say Alice and Bob have a channel, and Bob and Charlie have a channel, Alice can pay Charlie by hopping through their mutual friend Bob. Suddenly, those 4.5 transactions per second can scale into the billions.Now the efficacy of Satoshi’s original vision becomes plausible. The case can now be made unequivocally for bitcoin as a viable digital currency usable in everyday life across the globe. The Lightning Network’s adoption has grown exponentially, nearing 13,000 nodes and $60 million in total locked bitcoin, and is offering solutions to Bitcoin’s scalability to places like El Salvador, Vietnam, the Philippines and many other nations in desperate need of alternatives to their national currencies. The Lightning Network now even seems to be garnering the attention of mainstream players as Twitter is eyeing the implementation of the protocol into the platform. Even with the Lightning Network in use and growing in popularity all the time, there still stands other obstacles bitcoin must overcome to become the digital reserve currency of the world. Ever since Nixon broke the U.S. dollar away from the gold standard in 1971, USD has been in a state of inflation, now losing nearly 4% of its value year over year. Indeed, inflation is inevitable with any fiat currency, but the rise of digital currencies like bitcoin presents an alternative that is immune to fiat’s failings.As the Lightning Network grows in adoption, bitcoin will realize Satoshi Nakamoto's original intentions as a store of value and means of payment. Already, we can see multiple reasons why bitcoin is expertly positioned to be a dominant form of currency. It is often the first cryptocurrency acquired by those new to the crypto space. It is the most well known, highly regarded and commonly held cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin also has endless use cases as a universal form of exchange on almost all centralized exchanges, DEXs and nearly any DeFi platform one can find. With the additional help of a fast, high-throughput overlay network such as Lightning, bitcoin has the potential to become the global reserve currency of the future.This is a guest post by Sagi Bakshi.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.Yesterday's Daily Dive took a look at some of the structural changes in the bitcoin derivatives market over the course of 2021 and what they mean.First, what is a derivative? A derivative is a contract between two (or possibly more) parties whose value is derived from one or more underlying assets. A contract speculating on the price of bitcoin six months from now is an example of a derivative contract. Why does this matter, and how does it shape underlying supply and demand dynamics in the bitcoin market? Derivatives and leverage can most certainly whipsaw price, yet what matters for the bitcoin market is the spot market (i.e., real dollar or other fiat demand to buy BTC). Derivatives and futures contracts are just directional bets on what the spot price will be. However, derivatives markets offer the ability to use leverage to increase position size. An entity can take one bitcoin worth of capital and place trades with 10 bitcoin worth of buying power, however a 10% move in either direction can double your money, or wipe your account entirely. During the late months of 2020 and early months of 2021, it became increasingly popular amongst traders to use bitcoin as collateral to margin long bitcoin. This strategy was extremely profitable up until April as bitcoin doubled in value in just a four month period. This can be seen in the chart above, showing bitcoin futures open interest climbing in bitcoin terms from January to April. The strategy of using bitcoin as collateral to leverage long bitcoin can work as long as there is fresh capital entering the market to buy the underlying asset in spot markets. However, in April the spot bid began to slow up, and the market was left with a bunch of overextended bulls that were using their bitcoin as leverage. The problem with using bitcoin to margin long bitcoin is that during a market downturn, your position is losing value at the same time your collateral value is decreasing. There is a negative convexity to this strategy. So why does this matter? Because following the local top of $64,000 in April, the structure in the derivatives market has changed significantly.The day of the $64,000 all time high (and coincidentally the Coinbase IPO), 70% of the bitcoin futures market was using bitcoin as collateral. As highlighted above, this dynamic can lead to reflexive selling as collateral values and position profit and loss drawdown in unison.At the top of 2021, bitcoin-margined open interest hit a high of around 257,000 BTC, and was at approximately 248,000 BTC just before the May 19 flash crash, as open interest on bitcoin-margined futures contract drew down 31% in bitcoin terms, displaying the negative convexity highlighted previously. Currently, bitcoin-margined futures open interest is at approximately 177,000 BTC. What has taken the place of bitcoin-margined contracts is of course stablecoins. The chart below shows the explosive growth in stablecoin-margined futures contracts, which are not subject to the same dynamics during a downturn.The chart is denominated in bitcoin to display the relative growth of open interest despite the volatility in the bitcoin price. Here is the same chart in dollars for context.Another large change in market structure from the early months of 2021 is the funding rates on perpetual futures contracts. In the early months of 2021, funding was consistently positive, meaning that shorts were being paid by longs due to the overwhelming demand to go leverage-long bitcoin.However, since the middle of May, funding has stayed muted and has often trended negative, meaning that shorts pay longs to enter a position. This dynamic as well as the shift to stablecoin-margined derivatives means that the likelihood of a derivative market blowup and subsequent crash is extremely unlikely over the short term.WIth stablecoins as collateral, as bitcoin draws down, your buying power relative to what you are looking to buy increases. While this is an obvious statement to some, this means that dips will be bought aggressively, especially when funding is already in the negative. With bitcoin-margined futures playing an increasingly diminished role in the market, events as severe as March 13, 2020, and May 19, 2021 are far less likely. In that sense, the explosive growth in the stablecoin ecosystem should be celebrated. "

The next Daily Dive will focus on some of the probable factors at play and potential scenarios for the bitcoin market, while this letter will highlight the latest trends around bitcoin miners in particular. Bitcoin Mining DifficultyBitcoin mining difficulty adjusted downward on Sunday for the fourth time in a row. The -4.81% adjustment is following the historic -27.94% adjustment in the prior epoch that was caused by the record mining migration out of mainland China. The latest adjustment is another positive sign for entities who were able to keep their operations running, as the adjustments over the past two months have reduced difficulty by 45.5% from the all-time high, significantly increasing BTC denominated revenue for mining operations. Hash Rate And Mining Revenue With the four straight difficulty adjustments, hash rate and miner profitability have begun to rebound. The two metrics (seven-day moving averages) both bottomed on July 3, with miners now pulling in over 33% more today than in U.S. dollar revenue than they were at the bottom. Miner profitability, hash rate, and difficulty are all important to keep an eye on because — as has been previously covered in the Deep Dive — bitcoin is a commodity (among many other things). There is a production cost to bitcoin, and this production cost is driven by demand to hold the asset, and the inelastic supply of the asset that cannot rise as a function of demand like all other commodities. What can rise is hash rate and subsequently; difficulty. Conversely, the opposite has happened over the past couple of months, as the fall in hash rate has significantly lowered the (estimated) production cost of bitcoin. Below is the price of bitcoin, the energy value and the hash rate.A result of the increased profitability is that miners have accumulated 3,785 bitcoin over the last month, and this trend can be expected to continue as long as the production cost is this far below the price of bitcoin. Despite recent price action, this is a bullish development for not only the mining industry but also the market broadly."
2021-07-20T09:25:24-04:00," Watch This Episode On YouTubeListen To This Episode:On this episode of the “Bitcoin Magazine Podcast,” host Christian Keroles sat down with the infamous Bitcoin Twitter personality and troll Udi Wertheimer to discuss why the hardcore Bitcoin faithful should not be so worried about alternative cryptocurrencies, or “altcoins.” Generally speaking, Bitcoiners are very adversarial towards altcoins and those who support them. It is not unheard of to see Bitcoiners loudly decrying all altcoins as scams and altcoin investors as foolish. Neither Wertheimer nor Keroles believe that altcoins pose a real challenge to Bitcoin, nor that they can even be helpful for new people who are not quite primed to understand Bitcoin initially. Bitcoin is quite unintuitive to people still operating with a fiat mindset. Wertheimer also challenged Bitcoiners by claiming that they lose credibility when they continue to pretend that some altcoins like doge and ether have not outperformed bitcoin substantially in 2021. Wertheimer thinks that toxicity was much more necessary back in 2015 to 2017, during the Bitcoin fork wars. He now believes that Bitcoiners can be much more empathetic and successful at converting new Bitcoiners and precoiners to Bitcoin with a less toxic strategy. The current brand of altcoins pose no threat to Bitcoin itself and, if anything, it amplifies Bitcoin’s own brand, reach and total addressable market. Please listen, share and tell Bitcoin Magazine what you think of this conversations with Udi Wertheimer. "

Yields on U.S. treasury bonds continued to fall today, with the 10-year yield hitting 1.18%, as legacy markets have begun to risk off as the reflation trade from earlier in the year has lost significant steam.The S&P 500 Volatility Index ($VIX) spiked, as equities sold off sharply.S&P 500 Volatility Index ($VIX)S&P 500 Index As covered in the Daily Dive #018 - Impending Deflationary Bust, due to the massive amount of leverage in the incumbent financial markets, a deflationary bust is not only very possible, but even imminent (although the timeline cannot be known). The Federal Reserve and other global central banks have to continue to toe the line between financial asset hyperinflation or a deflationary bust and ensuing depression. If equity markets continue to fall, expect the talks of central banks “thinking about” tapering asset purchases to halt completely. The only game in town for financial markets to remain “stable” is for real yields to continue to be pushed further into negative territory (i.e., inflation picking up with yields being suppressed). This process, which is known otherwise as financial repression, is the only way out of a debt trap. "
2021-07-15T17:00:00-04:00," These essays mirror the exact chronological structure of ""Beyond Order"" by Jordan Peterson, offering a reflection through a Bitcoin lens. This is chapter six of a 12-part series. If you read the book, it adds a second dimension. All quotes credited to Jordan Peterson. All reflections inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto.“Heat and pressure transform the base matter of common coal into the crystalline perfection and rare value of the diamond. The same can be said of a person.”Bitcoin is the transmutation of the base matter of gold into digital perfection and rare value. Fiat currency is fragile and must be enforced via threat of punishment. Bitcoin is antifragile and becomes stronger with errors, stress, and time. How antifragile is your money?“A house divided against itself, proverbially, cannot stand. Likewise, a poorly integrated person cannot hold himself together when challenged.”Cash rules everything around me and permeates all segments of society. Wealth inequality has become a singular point of contention across conversations touching gender pay gap, racial pay disparity, reparations, universal basic income, increasing taxation and defunding the police. Governments have weaponized money to centrally manage the economy for so long that we are now paying the price for decades of misallocated capital. Our country has become a house divided against itself. The conversation is couched around social issues but the common thread connecting them all is the conversation is largely over money. Economies are too complex to be centrally planned. It’s a game of whack-a-mole that fails to address the fact that the money itself is in large part responsible for the chaos in the economy. Printing more money is like calling in the arsonist to fight the fire with gasoline. America has rested on her laurels for too long and has slipped from a high-quality nation into a poorly integrated one. It has caused generational atrophy.This is why we are fighting on every corner. What we need is something that benefits all Americans equally, but a thing we all individually must earn, defend and protect. That is what unites and that is what is American. Bitcoin moves America closer to a high-quality, well-integrated indivisible house.”Washington Crossing the Delaware” (Emanuel Leutze)“If you aim at nothing, you become plagued by everything.”The internet has shined a light on an unlimited number of social and global problems. It’s too many things to aim at. And I personally have fallen prey to this analysis paralysis. As we shed our naiveté and awaken to the many plagues facing humanity, it is easy to slip into cynicism and nihilism. None of us is able to solve all of humanity’s ails, but choose one. Money is one of those plagues and Bitcoin is aimed squarely at solving at least this one thing. “I typically encouraged my clients to choose the best path currently available to them, even if it was far from their ideal.”You may not like Bitcoin but it’s becoming irresponsible to own none. Those who understand it find it to be a blessing while others will be dragged, kicking and screaming, because time waits for no one. There are many use cases for Bitcoin adoption: tyrannical governments, failing currencies, inflation protection and avoiding confiscation. “Cynicism about such things, or mere indecision or doubt, finds an easy but truly adversarial ally in the mindless nihilistic rationality that undermines everything: Why bother?”We live in times of cynicism. Conspiracy theories, fake news, insecurity, invisible threats, imminent threats; it’s enough to make anyone feel powerless. So why bother when we’ve already lost the fight? True solutions to large complex problems are no easy task. Inflation currency promotes high-time-preference thinking, making focusing on good long-term solutions more challenging. Money alters behaviors and inflationary dollars promote short-term thinking when what we need most to turn these macro plagues around is solid long-term ideas that can be generated via low-time-preference thinking.“...the worst decision of all is none.”These problems won’t solve themselves. You don’t need to save the world. Tackle a small problem that is unserved: how about converting your savings account currently yielding 0.5% to a bitcoin savings account yielding 200%? Even small changes require a pound of flesh; steel your reserve, study up and put a little skin in the game. And if you don’t, walk away with three damn good reasons why you’re convinced bitcoin is not for you. But either way, hold your ground. Doing nothing is the worst decision of all. Pick a side and be open minded. It is lazy to pick sides based on glossy ideology. Coming to your own conclusions requires an understanding of both sides. You don’t have to believe in Bitcoin, but know exactly why or why not and be willing to defend that hill.“But the story of integration and socialization does not end here. Initially the apprentice must become a servant of tradition, of structure, and of dogma, just as the child who wants to play must follow the rules of the game.”Bitcoin is purchased through exchanges requiring Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance. Bitcoin plays the role of the apprentice as a servant of tradition, structure and dogma. But history teaches us the path of infrastructure inversion: the horse to the car, natural gas to electricity and landlines (telephony) to fiber optics (internet). In all three of these examples the new technology initially appears inferior because it rides on the old infrastructure. Then an inflection point is met where the users find enough value in the new infrastructure to justify the switching costs. Finally, the old technology is easily accommodated on the new infrastructure. Most people recognize bitcoin the asset — the coin. Fewer understand the power of Bitcoin the network — the new infrastructure. As second-layer application development expands Bitcoin’s utility, user adoption increases in tandem, bringing the free market closer to this infrastructure inversion. As Bitcoin offers more to more people, its network effect grows. Once Bitcoin breaks the inflection point, it becomes undeniably attractive: switching cost drops, value increases and the new infrastructure consumes its predecessor. This is not a best-guess; this is a likelihood based on path dependence.Image sourceThe achilles heel of digital money is precisely that it rides on old infrastructure: the original internet. That internet of communication is inherently an insecure network. This is why the cybersecurity industry is described as layers of an onion. It can be attacked at every imaginable angle because, at its core, the internet is not built for security. Therefore, cybersecurity on the internet of communication will never be solved because it is an infinite problem. Bitcoin, the internet of money, is an inherently secure network at birth by design. As traditional banks figure this out, their hefty security budgets will shrink considerably.“The goal of this heat and pressure is subordination of an undeveloped personality… to a single path, for the purposes of transformation from undisciplined beginner to accomplished master.”In an ADHD society that loves the newest, shiniest object, Bitcoin is singularly focused on one thing: being a store of value. This makes it appear boring to the untrained eye, but for those in the trenches, we witness a network tested by immense pressure for the purpose of transformation from new money on the block to a Bitcoin standard.“… the Gospel of Mark, which is a commentary on what are among the most influential Rules of the Game ever formulated — the Mosaic Ten Commandments…”The Ten Commandments gave mankind a protocol for coexistence. Bitcoin gave mankind a protocol for trust. The Bitcoin protocol includes code that is well known, such as a 21 million hard cap supply and four-year halving cycles, as well as less known, such as difficulty adjustments, amongst many other topics. Each Bitcoin full node enforces these protocol rules and serves as your private access point to Bitcoin’s open global pseudonymous blockchain.“It is worthwhile thinking of these Commandments as a minimum set of rules for a stable society — an iterable social game.”The Ten Commandments are bedrock foundations in nearly every Western society. They enabled order, allowing civilizations to rise. Fiat currency is a fluid set of rules that change as needs arise. This leads to misuse because changes dictated by the few impact the majority. When monetary policy is unpredictable, the majority live high-anxiety, stress-filled existences. At its highest level, Bitcoin is a simple set of fixed rules. The rules are determined by the nodes. The idea is that the protocol can change, with node consent, but calcifies over time. This is in stark contrast to fiat currencies. New additions like Lightning Network or Rootstock are built on top of Bitcoin’s foundations, leaving the underlying protocol unchanged, but serve to augment new functionality such as scale or speed. Just as sand is a suboptimal anchor for a home because it constantly shifts beneath you, fiat is a suboptimal anchor for money. Bitcoin is the strongest foundation for money ever invented by mankind. Just like a home anchored to granite, Bitcoin offers a highly predictable unwavering protocol. Bitcoin is money you can build thousand-year civilizations around. “The core idea is this: subjugate yourself voluntarily to a set of socially determined rules — those with some tradition in their formulation — and a unity that transcends the rules will emerge.” Choose a game that presents the best opportunity for success and consider how fairly the game treats you. This is why football (aka “soccer”) is a worldwide phenomenon — it’s egalitarian. Football is the most popular sport on earth played by 250 million and watched by four billion. Anyone can kick a ball, making it incredibly inclusive. Bitcoin and football share much in common. Opening a bank account is not possible for billions around the world due to the barriers to entry. But anyone with an internet connection can open a bitcoin account. And no one can confiscate, censor or inflate away your bitcoin. The game of Bitcoin is a major upgrade for the average human being. And its openness allows it to transcend the rules enforced by closed systems. Unity is beginning to emerge around Bitcoin as humanity awakens to the most egalitarian game we’ve ever played. Bitcoin is to money what football is to sport — the beautiful game.“It is for this reason that an apprenticeship ends with a masterpiece, the creation of which signifies not only the acquisition of the requisite skill, but the acquisition of the ability to create new skills.”And if you’re daring, bold and wise enough, you can submit a Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIPs). Bitcoin continues its development with contributions from unsung heroes like Adam Back, Pieter Wuille, Peter Todd, Nicholas Doirier, Luke Dashjr and many more. They are moving us closer toward a masterpiece. Most mere mortals can contribute by simply running a full node. That gives you the freedom to choose which version of the game serves the best spirit. Bitcoin is free to join, free to leave. That’s real freedom. Join the beautiful game. Work as hard as you possibly can on Bitcoin and see what happens.This is a guest post by Nelson Chen.

2021-07-13T12:41:33-04:00," BIT Mining, a bitcoin mining company and owner of the BTC.com mining pool, has announced that it has reached securities purchase agreements with select investors to raise $50 million in a private placement.Under the terms of the placement, which will not involve a public offering and is expected to close around July 16, 2021, BIT Mining will issue 100 million Class A ordinary shares at a purchase price of $5 per ten shares.Already included in the price is one warrant per share, which investors can use to purchase additional shares later. The warrants will have a term of three years and will be exercisable six months following their issuance date, at $6.81 per ten shares. Furthermore, upon the satisfaction of certain undisclosed conditions, an investor would be able to convert ten shares into one “American Depositary Share” (ADS) of the company.BIT Mining plans to use the proceeds of the private placement to expand its bitcoin mining operations worldwide. After the recent bitcoin crackdowns in China, the company has devised an “overseas deployment strategy,” which dictates how it plans to move its operations to more welcoming countries. BIT started moving part of its mining rigs to Kazakhstan in June, having made some investments in bitcoin data centers in Texas at a similar time.Besides aiding with BIT’s overseas deployment strategy, the offering, whose sole placement agent is H.C. Wainwright & Co., will also allow the bitcoin mining firm to acquire additional mining machines, build new data centers, expand its infrastructure and improve its working capital position. Consequently, BIT might further increase the hash rate capacity of its BTC.com mining pool, which currently accounts for over 11% of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate."
2021-07-10T12:00:00-04:00," Bitcoin has risen from the dead so many times, it makes Lazarus look lazy. Yet its doubters persist: “Bitcoin is a bubble,” they say; a “risky speculation with little chance of ever becoming an established form of money,” they shout.But Bitcoin’s obituarists are not just mistaken: they are cast iron, copper-bottomed, 180 degrees wrong. Because Bitcoin’s success isn’t speculative, it’s a certainty. Or at least, as certain as anything can be in the world of finance.Why am I so sure? Like any other Bitcoin supporter, I believe in the brilliance that’s baked into Bitcoin at the technical level. I believe in the fundamental value bitcoin holds for an individual's financial sovereignty. I believe in its capacity to move wealth through time. And perhaps most importantly, I believe it is the best way to survive the tectonic economic shifts we are witnessing in the world today. And we “believers'' are no longer alone. Bitcoin is now being embraced by everyone from institutions to governments to ordinary savers. Despite the press being fixated on price, Bitcoin continues to pass many structural and cultural adoption milestones with rapidity and ease.All the evidence heralding Bitcoin’s rise to reserve status is there. All you have to do is look.You don’t have to search too far to find disquisitions on Bitcoin’s technical and theoretical brilliance, so I’ll keep my own precis brief. When fiat replaced the gold standard half a century ago, the world’s bankers (including central bankers) discovered a multitude of ways to debase the currency. President Biden’s $3 trillion splurge is only the latest example of paper money’s malleability. Conversely, and as more people each day are realizing, Bitcoin can’t be inflated: there is a hard cap of 21 million coins. There’s simply no way to print or create more of it out of thin air.Bitcoin’s other advantages include the fact that, being digital, it does not require physical infrastructure to store. No vaults, no heavily-guarded vans or aeroplanes, no Fort Knox. You can transfer a billion dollars’ worth with a couple of clicks. And then there’s the fact that Bitcoin is not controlled by a central authority, which has rendered any attacks (and there have been a few) ineffective.That, in a nutshell, is why Bitcoin ought to become the world’s reserve currency. Now let’s look at why it will.We don’t need to speculate about Bitcoin’s rise to reserve currency status because it’s happening already. No, governments are not buying it or issuing bonds priced in BTC yet. But who says you need a green light from the government before you start putting funds into a safe haven?Several very large public companies have already started converting their fiat balances into bitcoin. And why wouldn’t they when, as Microstrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor says, holding cash is like sitting on a melting ice cube? With businesses like Tesla, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs buying big tranches of Bitcoin and opening trading desks, and as loose monetary policy erodes fiat’s value yet further, we’re already a long way down the road to reserve currency status. There will be no big “Aha!” moment, when the Fed admits fiat was a mistake and starts converting to bitcoin. And there doesn’t need to be. When private companies, corporate treasuries and ordinary citizens adopt Bitcoin as their go-to savings asset, everything snowballs from there. There’s another key driver of adoption that’s rarely mentioned. It’s often forgotten that politicians are people too, and if they’re smart their financial advisors will be urging them to hedge against the coming one world currency, one world tax system, and ever-surveilled economic paradigm with bitcoin. The government's hypocrisy is going to become increasingly evident as governments continue to speak against bitcoin when its own members have holdings themselves. None of this is meant to give the impression that Bitcoin will follow a single, arrow-straight pathway to hegemony. Even our community disagrees on how the Bitcoin network should develop: some say it’s perfect as it is but others think there’s more work to be done on UX, infrastructure and blockchain-based financial services. It’s the same with regulation, with opinion divided on whether bitcoin ought to be regulated or if it should not (or cannot) be subject to oversight and control. There is wisdom in all these views. But however bitcoin develops, one inevitability is that attempts to kill it will fail. Countries like India and Pakistan have tried to ban holding or transacting bitcoin, only to be defeated in the courts or simply by the technical impossibility of stopping peer-to-peer transactions.My own view is that regulation is an inevitability. And as such, the best option is to preemptively gun for sensible and industry-led frameworks. And it is my hope that governments will engage in constructive dialogue with those who understand Bitcoin’s technological and monetary characteristics. Postponing the inevitable does no favors for anyone, but through engagement and collaboration we can build a new economy that’s fit for our increasingly digitally-connected lives. Yes, regulation is a slow, often ponderous process. But the sooner we have clarity over how governments will officially view Bitcoin - whether a black, white or grey economy - the faster we can finally deliver solutions that work for everyone. We, along with many other financial experts, are waiting in the wings, always willing to engage with governments and regulators so that together we can make the inevitable work for everyone.This is a guest post by Nik Oraevskiy.

Over $16 billion worth of losses have been realized since May 13. The steady bleed of the class of 2021 bitcoin investors continues, as shown by the largest capitulation event in the history of bitcoin in terms of aggregate dollar losses. On-chain data shows that a notably large amount of UTXOs in the age range of 3-6 months have recently moved, which further supports the notion that buyers from within the range of $40,000-$60,0000 have been capitulating. This next point is worth repeating. Do not allocate into bitcoin more than you can afford to lose, especially if the funds will be needed in a short period of time. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, but this is the key point:During the monetization phase of bitcoin’s history (what we are currently living through), the exchange rate volatility is the price you pay for returns. Without the immense volatility, the upside potential and investment risk/reward would not be as asymmetric.This further highlights the simplicity and elegance of dollar-cost averaging into a bitcoin position. A simple daily dollar-cost average strategy would have you up 71.02% year over year.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Technical analysts weighed in after bitcoin's latest price movements. (Photo illustration by ... [+] Chesnot/Getty Images)Bitcoin prices have been trading primarily between $30,000 and $42,000 since late May, but recently, they have repeatedly attempted to mount convincing breakouts. In the last week, the cryptocurrency surpassed the upper limit of the aforementioned range multiple times, CoinDesk figures show. It reached $42,351.93, $42,369.39 and $42,435.07 on July 30, July 31, and August 1, respectively, additional CoinDesk data reveals. More recently, the digital asset has fallen back somewhat, declining to as little as $38,978.57 this morning, down roughly 8.1% from yesterday’s recent high. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Key Technical LevelsKeeping these latest developments in mind, several technical analysts weighed in, shedding some light on bitcoin’s crucial levels of support and resistance. Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, LLC, offered some perspective: “Bitcoin has broken through the resistance I have been highlighting defined by the cloud model, which lowers over time,” she stated. “It previously was near $42K, but has since lowered to below $38K, such that a breakout has already been confirmed above cloud-based resistance.”“A Fibonacci retracement level near $42.6K remains intact as resistance, however, so I would imagine some are focused on that,” Stockton added. “Once that level is surmounted, the targeted level becomes $51.1K based on the Fibonacci levels,” she concluded. William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform Token Metrics, also chimed in.“Bitcoin is facing substantial resistance near $43k,” he stated, adding that this resistance is “clear on charts.” Potential OpportunityNoble spoke to the recent pullback, describing bitcoin’s recent drop to roughly $39,000 as “an opportunity to get involved if you missed the rally.”“The decline in bitcoin from $42k to $39k is likely a pause that refreshes,” he stated. Mark Warner, head of trading at BCB Group, also offered a bullish take. “There are many sellers at $42,000, where longs have been trapped since 19 May, so we expect more resistance at this level. A confirmation of the breakout, by BTC retesting $34,500-$36,000, could provide buying opportunities for those who missed out.”Downside RiskWhile the aforementioned analysts focused on bitcoin’s resistance and potential buying opportunities, other market observers commented on how the digital currency could suffer further losses. Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, spoke to this. “BTC is still in its trading range and, as a matter of fact, BTC seems to be respecting the technical boundaries of that trading range ($30k-$42k) fairly well so far,” he said. “Unless we see a clear break above that upper boundary, the risk now seems to be the downside again.”Jason Lau, COO of cryptocurrency exchange Okcoin, also weighed in. “Bitcoin's been stuck in this range for the past few months and resistance at the $42k level was expected,” he noted. “Bitcoin last hit this range in mid June and fell 30% the following week,” Lau emphasized. “Key metrics around BTC futures and premiums look similar to the last time,” he said. “BTC futures open interest has rebounded in past few days, but at similar levels to mid June.” “Since 7/31, BTC futures funding rates have turned positive, having been mostly negative for the past few weeks. Again, we are now at similar levels to mid June.” “Looking ahead, we would need to see a clean price break above $42,000, along with a strong uptick in BTC futures funding rates, before we can confirm a breakout of the range,” said Lau.

The combined crypto market has added $250 billion over the last week and is now nearing $1.7 trillion.

""The provision includes updating the definition of broker to reflect the realities of how digital assets are acquired and traded,"" the document said. ""The provision further makes clear that broker-to-broker reporting applies to all transfers of covered securities within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3), including digital assets.""""Things are moving fast, which can feel scary,"" wrote Chervinsky, adding ""don't panic. This provision isn't final yet and still can be changed.""Chervinsky warned that ""it defies logic to adopt a regulation for which compliance is literally impossible, unless the goal is to kill the industry,"" and ""this could mean a de facto ban on [crypto] mining in the USA.""Since China's bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining crackdown in recent months—in which those who use powerful computers to secure blockchains and validate transactions in return for new crypto tokens were expelled from the country—the U.S. has emerged as a potential new home for many.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Metallic Bitcoin symbol over financial chart. Horizontal composition with selective focus and copy ... [+] space.A survey from Fidelity Digital Assets has revealed that seven in ten institutional investors from around the world, including advisors, family offices, pensions, hedge funds, and endowments, plan to buy or invest in digital assets within the next five years. Additionally, more than 90% of those interested in the industry say they expect to have an allocation of digital assets in their institutions' or clients’ portfolios in the next five years.  However, it is worth noting that not every respondent necessarily uses the same internal definition for the term ‘digital asset’. When asked about how it was presented in the survey (the full document will not be released until September), a Fidelity spokesperson told Forbes: “It was defined as assets that are issued and transferred electronically, and bitcoin and Ethereum were given as examples. Re: allocations, exposure to digital asset companies (e.g., common stock) could be considered as part of a portfolio allocation in addition to cryptocurrencies.” In other words, stock in publicly traded companies that deal with crypto could also be considered digital assets.More than half of respondents across the U.S, Europe and Asia currently invest in digital assets, with adoption rates highest in Asia (71%). 56% of European institutions and 33% of U.S institutions now hold investments in the asset class, up from 45% and 27%, respectively, last year. “The pandemic – and fiscal and monetary measures in response to it – has been a catalyst for many institutional investors to define their investment thesis and operationalize it.” says Tom Jessop, President of Fidelity Digital Assets. There is, however, some fine print to these results. The survey, which included 1,100 respondents across the U.S (408), Europe (393) and Asia (299), was conducted at the very height of the recent crypto bull market (December 2, 2020-April 2, 2021). Bitcoin would go on to reach its all-time high of $64,654 on April 14th, coinciding with leading bitcoin exchange Coinbase going public. Since that time bitcoin, ether, and the broader crypto market has lost approximately 50% of its value. However, a Fidelity spokesperson told Forbes, “we haven’t seen a material change in demand during the drawdown given institutions tend to hold a long-term view and are experienced in managing through cycles.”Bitcoin and Ether are far off of their all-time highs Finally, while interest remains high there are still concerns that could impede further adoption, with the largest being price volatility. Another is the lack of fundamentals to gauge value as well as worries about market manipulation. On the positive side, past concerns about technological complexity for institutions and immature market infrastructure seems to have dwindled."

Extreme bitcoin price swings have been outmatched by the meme-based dogecoin, Elon Musk's pet project that's rocketed into the cryptocurrency top ten by value this year (subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and discover crypto blockbusters poised for 1,000% gains).As cryptocurrency traders are whiplashed by bitcoin and dogecoin volatility, investors are braced for a closely-watched live discussion between Musk and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, set for 2pm EDT—with The ₿ Word event organizers promising ""nothing is off-limits.""Sign up now for CryptoCodex—a free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious that explains the world of bitcoin with brevity. Arriving in your inbox at 7am EDT every weekdayTesla billionaire Elon Musk is set to take the stage at with Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey ... [+] today, with the pair likely debating bitcoin, dogecoin and the future of cryptocurrency. Announced last month, The ₿ Word is a bitcoin-focused online event that says it aims to ""demystify and destigmatize mainstream narratives about bitcoin"" and expand bitcoin awareness among companies and institutions.Musk, who has alienated much of the bitcoin community with his irreverent attitude toward crypto since plowing $1.5 billion of Tesla's cash into bitcoin earlier this year, initially trashed the event on Twitter before agreeing to attend. Musk has repeatedly attacked so-called bitcoin maxis—who argue against all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin—in recent months, calling for developers to suggest dogecoin upgrade ideas and promising the doge memecoin will eventually ""beat bitcoin hands down.""The dogecoin price has surged by many thousands of percent since the beginning of 2021, with investors pouring cash into the memecoin in the aftermath of trading restrictions being placed on viral meme stock Gamestop in January. Dogecoin tokens traded for mere fractions of a cent for years before surging to an all-time high of $0.73 in April on the back of a Musk-fuelled pump.The 2021 bitcoin price rally, which saw bitcoin soar to around $65,000 per bitcoin before crashing back, was largely driven by expectations Tesla's bet on bitcoin would spark a surge of corporate and institutional bitcoin buying that failed to transpire.Bitcoin's April crash, helping to wipe over $1 trillion from the combined crypto market capitalization, was partly caused by Musk's shock announcement Tesla was pulling the bitcoin payment support it had added just a few weeks earlier. In a statement Musk cited bitcoin's eye-watering energy demands, promising he would restart Tesla's bitcoin support if the bitcoin network increased its use of renewable energy. After China's expulsion of bitcoin and crypto miners—who use powerful computers to secure the blockchain networks in return for freshly-minted tokens—in recent months, some have argued bitcoin's renewable energy mix has crossed Musk's required threshold. However, the ill-will generated by Musk's flippant attitude toward bitcoin on Twitter has led to many of bitcoin's most dedicated supporters denouncing Musk.This week, Musk responded to a news story reporting his expected attendance at the event this week in his signature, offhand manner.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Recent comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, highlight the need for more productive conversations around crypto competition. GettyDuring testimony to both the House and Senate the topic of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) was raised and discussed, and illustrated just how serious this conversation has become. Far from the early days of crypto being thought of as a tool for criminals and other illegal actors, central governments the world over are rapidly working on various type of crypto-fiat hybrid currencies. This is not news, but comments about the possibility of bitcoin being potentially rendered obsolete by a U.S. CBDC shows just how much more education and awareness is needed. Bitcoin may have been the first crypto to go mainstream, and certainly tends to dominate blockchain and crypto conversations, but is just one of thousands of cryptoassets that exist in the marketplace. The introduction of new crypto variations has not weakened or diminished the appeal, functionality, or fundamentals of bitcoin. Rather the proliferation of stablecoins, CBDCs, and other blockchain and crypto related applications has strengthened the health of the ecosystem at large. Viewed through that lens, there is no reason to think that the continuing introduction of CBDCs will render bitcoin or other crypto obsolete. What is safe to say, however, is that crypto competition will only improve the dynamism of the sector. Let’s take a look at few potential implications of this increased crypto competition, both now and going forward. Crypto adoption. What has increasingly already been happening is that, setting aside the views of bitcoin maximalists, is that for most individuals and institutions bitcoin is currently viewed as an investment versus a currency. Stablecoins and CBDCs, related directly to how these instruments were designed and built, continue to play the role of crypto that can be used for transactional purposes. Bitcoin may indeed become the world currency of the future, and news out of El Salvador and other nations adopting bitcoin as legal tender does point to this possibility. That said, the price volatility and high cost of entrance (when priced in dollars) do seem to work against bitcoin being used a currency for the time being. CBDCs, instead of rendering bitcoin obsolete, seem well positioned to play a complementary role. Better crypto. Even as it is currently constituted crypto transactions offer several substantive benefits when compared to incumbent fiat transactions. Crypto transactions are, generally speaking, faster, cheaper, easier to confirm, and instantly accessible versus fiat transactions. That is not to say that this is the end stage of crypto; quite to the contrary. Even in just the last several years there have been several protocol improvements (on both the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains) that have improved the performance and speed of these networks. The introduction of a U.S. CBDC would not immediately sweep aside all other cryptoassets, but instead would unlock a new wave of innovation in the space. An improved ecosystem. Up until recently there was still a perception among some institutions and policymakers that crypto would be, if not banned outright, regulated and constrained to such an extent that it would be rendered virtually unusable. This has obviously proven to be an erroneous view, and actually the opposite has occurred; almost every large financial institution and numerous nations have moved into the crypto space in an active way. Despite this, there is a certain segment of the population that has been hesitant to become directly involved with what has admittedly been an area that has been volatile and exists in an ambiguous regulatory environment. The introduction of a CBDC by a major world economy will not solve every issue linked to crypto, and there will still be regulatory issues to sort out, but it would go a long way to ironing out the remaining open items. The crypto market has proven itself, time and again, to be robust, resilient, and continuously open to new ideas and ways of doing things. Crypto has rapidly evolved from just bitcoin to a complex and fast moving ecosystem consisting of thousands of different cryptoassets, but it is important to remember that it is still a new economic area. CBDCs and other type of cryptoassets will invariably be introduced to the marketplace, and may actually challenge bitcoin and other earlier versions of crypto for market leadership. That said, there is no reason to think that CBDCs will lead to bitcoin becoming obsolete. To the contrary, as CBDCs become increasingly common and mainstream the cryptoasset sector – including bitcoin – will become stronger as a result.I am a professor at the City University of New York – Lehman College.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," The price of bitcoin fell below $30,000 Tuesday morning, losing nearly all its 2021 gains as $100 billion was wiped from the crypto market, mirroring the sharp falls in global markets amid concerns the fast-spreading Delta variant of Covid-19 could hamper economic recovery.Bitcoin was down Tuesday as the crypto market slid. Bitcoin fell roughly 6% Tuesday to just over $29,600 a token, only slightly above the $29,022 it started 2021 on and less than half an all-time-high of more than $64,000 in mid April.Other major cryptocurrencies also fell, with ethereum down around 7%, cardano 10%, Ripple’s XRP 8% and dogecoin 9%. Around $100 billion has been wiped off the crypto market in the last 24 hours, compounding earlier losses sparked by increased regulatory activity around the world and China’s crackdown on energy intensive crypto mining.   While the precise cause of the fall is unclear, the crypto market is mirroring sharp falls in markets around the world—including the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its biggest one-day drop since October—as experts fear renewed restrictions and a slower recovery caused by the infectious Delta Covid-19 variant.  Regulatory action against BlockFi, a bitcoin financial services platform, by New Jersey’s Office of the Attorney General on Monday evening also ignited fears of a broader regulatory crackdown, which have previously triggered sell-offs.  The infectious Delta variant is driving new waves of Covid-19 around the world, including in highly vaccinated countries that had already managed to control the virus. The variant, which is resistant to vaccines and possibly capable of causing more severe disease, is also driving a surge of new cases in the U.S. and many regions—including parts of Europe, Israel and Australia—are reinstating restrictions and lockdowns to contain outbreaks. Some areas, notably the U.K., are preparing to just “live with the virus” and England has dropped virtually all pandemic restrictions. While many scientists have branded this strategy as dangerous and ignoring the threat of long Covid, businesses have lamented the burden of a contact tracing system prompting people to self-isolate combined with such a high-case rate (the U.K. has the highest in the world), leaving them short of workers. As the path to recovery becomes less clear, the markets reflect this and are less optimistic.   Global markets shaken by fears over Delta variant (FT)New Jersey Attorney General Issues Cease And Desist Order Against Multi-Billion Dollar Bitcoin Financial Services Platform (Forbes)Stock Market Sell-Off: Dow Plunges 700 Points In Worst Drop Since October As Delta Variant Fears Mount (Forbes)I am a London-based reporter for Forbes covering breaking news.

Among the crypto top ten by value, ethereum rivals BNB and cardano led the market lower with a more than 10% sell-off while ethereum itself was around 8% lower. Ripple's XRP, currently in the midst of a legal battle with the SEC, was some 10% lower, with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's pet project dogecoin off by 7%. The bitcoin price was down by just over 6%, adding to loses of 10% this past week. ""Bitcoin's swing range has declined recently, forming the basis for a powerful exit with a compressed spring effect,"" says Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro, who warned the bottom could be about to fall out of the bitcoin and crypto market. ""A sequence of increasingly lower highs is a significant selling factor. Given the fear-of-missing-out nature of cryptocurrencies, a prolonged consolidation is increasingly frustrating for speculators. The main question now is whether bitcoin fall to the levels near $23,300, where it paused before last Christmas. We cannot rule out that with massive liquidation of margin positions the price will even close the gap at $18,000. Overall, such a reversal would be a repeat of the 2018 so-called crypto winter, opening the possibility for a price collapse toward a bottom near $10,000 and nullifying the rally since October 2020.""The bitcoin price, having tested the $30,000 level repeatedly over the last few weeks, appears to have been spooked by a cease and desist order that was issued to New Jersey-based bitcoin financial services platform BlockFi by the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General and the Bureau of Securities last night. The story, first reported by Forbes, triggered a wave of selling as investors feared this could be part of a wider crackdown on the myriad of crypto lending platforms that have sprung up over the last couple of years. BlockFi offers interest rates to depositors between 0.25% and 8.5% depending on the crypto asset and deposit size. The regulatory action is the latest in a string of blows to the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market that began with China's latest crackdown on crypto miners—who secure cryptocurrency blockchains with high-powered computers in return for freshly-minted tokens—in April. Since then, major crypto exchange Binance has seen a wave of pressure from regulators around the world, with many warning against investors using the platform. Meanwhile, U.S. regulators have turned their attention to the booming stablecoin market that's swelled to a $100 billion value over the last 12 months. Yesterday, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen met with various other government agencies to discuss how stablecoins should be governed. CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Bitcoin prices fell to their lowest since late June today as they tested the bottom of their current ... [+] range. Bitcoin prices, which have been trading largely between $30,000 and $42,000 for close to two months, have been repeatedly testing the bottom of this range lately. Earlier today, the world’s most prominent digital currency fell to as little as $30,426.88, according to CoinDesk data. At this point, it was trading at its lowest since June 26, additional CoinDesk figures show. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Bitcoin’s Descending Triangle Chuck Jones, a senior contributor for Forbes, wrote about the cryptocurrency’s recent price movements in an article published today, noting that bitcoin recently formed a descending triangle. “The descending triangle is a bearish formation that usually forms during a downtrend as a continuation pattern,” according to StockCharts.com. These formations are “bearish patterns that indicate distribution,” or selling of an asset. An Investopedia article provides further info, stating that: “Descending triangles are a very popular chart pattern among traders because it clearly shows that the demand for an asset, derivative or commodity is weakening.”“When the price breaks below the lower support, it is a clear indication that downside momentum is likely to continue or become even stronger,” the piece added. Analysts Weigh InSeveral experts spoke to this situation, offering some key technical analysis that investors might use. “There definitely is a descending triangle on the daily chart,” said Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst of TrendSpider. “This is generally looked at as a bearish continuation pattern but can break to the upside in some cases.” Jason Lau, COO of cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, also weighed in. “I would generally agree” that bitcoin has entered a descending triangle, he said. “However the support levels in the $30k range have held despite repeated tests.” While Lau spoke to the resilience the digital currency had near $30,000, some analysts emphasized the losses the digital currency could face if it breaks through the support that exists around this key, psychological level. “If the descending triangle starts to break down through the previous lows, market participants should watch for a move down to the Covid crash anchored VWAP below around $26,500,” stated Wujastyk. He also emphasized the digital asset’s market history. “Based on Bitcoin's seasonality over the last 5 years shown on TrendSpider, August has one of the lowest win rates of the year at 20%,” said Wujastyk. “This means that since 2016, only 1 of 5 August monthly closes has been higher than the July close.”“A combination of the bearish technical setup and low win rate for August would suggest a move further down rather than up into the rest of the 3rd quarter.” “Bitcoin is looking precarious and is trading lower alongside global markets as concerns of economic recovery rise,” said Pankaj Balani, cofounder & CEO of Delta Exchange. He noted that compared to May and June, the digital currency has a far greater chance of falling below $30,000. Balani emphasized that if “BTC breaks below $30,000 convincingly,” it could experience “sharp moves on the downside.”Bullish FactorsWhile the analysts who contributed input for this article frequently offered bearish commentary, they did highlight several developments that could prove bullish. “If the descending triangle breaks out to the upside, market participants should watch for a move up to test the ‘all-time high anchored VWAP’ around $42,000,” said Wujastyk. Jon Pearlstone, publisher of the newsletter CryptoPatterns, also spoke to the cryptocurrency’s potential upside. “Bulls want bitcoin to break resistance at $35,000 which then puts a target of $42,500 in play.” Past that, in the short-term, concerns about the digital currency suffering further losses may be overblown, according to Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, LLC. “I see where they’re seeing the triangle,” she said regarding the analysts who are reading bitcoin’s recent price movements as being contained within a descending triangle. “I label it as a consolidation phase,” said Stockton. “It’s ‘ripe for a shakeout’ in my opinion,” she stated, referring to a situation where weaker hands sell and stronger hands swoop in and buy. In other words, the support that bitcoin has close to $30,000 may hold up after all. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is displayed in front of the Bitcoin ... [+] course's graph of Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)After peaking at $63,503 on April 13 this year bitcoin has fallen just over 50% to approximately $30,700 today. It is still up 6% for the year but has been in a steady downward trend since it tried to rally in the late April to mid-May timeframe and failed to make a new high. There are two technical patterns that show bitcoin is at a critical juncture.Bitcoin price chartHead and shouldersStockCharts.com describes a head and shoulders pattern as, “the Head and Shoulders reversal pattern is made up of a left shoulder, a head, a right shoulder, and a neckline.” It adds, “A Head and Shoulders reversal pattern forms after an uptrend, and its completion marks a trend reversal. The pattern contains three successive peaks, with the middle peak (head) being the highest and the two outside peaks (shoulders) being low and roughly equal. The reaction lows of each peak can be connected to form support, or a neckline.”As can be seen in bitcoin’s chart there was a heads and shoulders pattern formed between March and May this year. And then it decisively broke below the neckline support at $50,000.Descending triangleThe near-term technical bearish pattern that has formed is a descending triangle. StockCharts.com describes it as, “a bearish formation that usually forms during a downtrend as a continuation pattern. There are instances when descending triangles form as reversal patterns at the end of an uptrend, but they are typically continuation patterns. Regardless of where they form, descending triangles are bearish patterns that indicate distribution (or selling of shares).”After an attempted rally in late June bitcoin has seen a series of lower highs with the base of the triangle right around where it is currently trading. If the pattern holds, which is by no means a certainty, and bitcoin breaks below the base of the triangle, there is some longer term support around $30,000 but it could easily fall below this level.I provide independent research of technology companies and was previously one of two analysts that determined the technology holdings for Atlantic Trust (Invesco's high…I provide independent research of technology companies and was previously one of two analysts that determined the technology holdings for Atlantic Trust (Invesco's highI provide independent research of technology companies and was previously one of two analysts that determined the technology holdings for Atlantic Trust (Invesco's high net worth group), a firm with $15 billion under management.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," BITCOIN STALLS AS BINANCE FACES MORE REGULATORY QUESTIONSNot a great week for bitcoin as it’s squeezing into a tight consolidation range in the low-$30,000s. The cryptocurrency, promoted as a hedge against inflation but still seen as a risky asset, took a dip on Tuesday, following a Labor Department report of an accelerating inflation. “Overall, the risk of downside below $30,000 on bitcoin is much higher now than what it was in the months of May and June,” writes Pankaj Balani, CEO of crypto derivatives platform Delta Exchange, in a note shared with Forbes. As of Friday morning, bitcoin is changing hands at a price below $32,000.The breakdown one direction or another may come as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) will release a swath of its shares worth 16,240 BTC on July 17, one of the largest such unlocks to date. Analysts have been debating what impact the coming unlocks will have on bitcoin’s price.Meanwhile, the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance,stopped selling tokens linked to shares of publicly listed companies a.k.a tokenized stocks in the face of the latest regulatory probe. On July 16, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said Binance was not licensed to sell “stock tokens” in the city. The move came a day after Italian regulators issued a similar warning and Binance faces further questions about its business model from officials around the world.Crypto is poised to set a new record for the biggest private round fundraise ever. CRYPTO VENTURE CAPITAL KEEPS SETTING RECORDSCrypto is poised to set a new record for the biggest private round fundraise ever. The France-based fantasy soccer game and non-fungible token (NFT) trading platform Sorare is close to completing a $532 million funding round, led by Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank with participation from London-based venture capital firm Atomico, at a $3.8 billion valuation. This round would add to an already lucrative 2021 for crypto startups, which has seen the top six funding rounds this year collectively raise more than $1.9 billion. An NFT platform setting a new record in this climate would also counter the narrative that the vertical is losing steam after a white-hot winter.PAYPAL UPS ITS BITCOIN LIMITSAre you buying crypto with PayPal? Good news: eligible PayPal customers in the U.S. can now buy up to $100,000 worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies per week (up from a previous limit of $20,000) with no annual purchase limit. The payments giant launched its crypto services last October and later added the capability to buy bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies via its mobile payment app Venmo. While the firm has been quiet about its average monthly cryptocurrency volume, CEO Dan Schulman told Forbes in April he expected the number would hit $200 million within months.THE DIGITAL EURO PROJECTCentral banks around the world are hard at work on digital currencies. On Wednesday, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) launched the investigation phase of a digital euro project, a significant step that could lead to the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the euro zone. The announcement marks the beginning of a two-year investigation process, during which time the central bank will work to develop a functional CBDC design while also addressing questions related to its impact on monetary policy, financial stability and illicit activity. It will also evaluate necessary changes to the European Union legislative framework.Meanwhile, the pace of CBDC rollouts is picking up. In 2020 the Bahamas launched the first CBDC, the Sand Dollar. Additionally, the People’s Bank of China, running one of the most advanced such programs in the world, is already conducting real-world trials and announced earlier this month that 10 million people have been made eligible to participate in retail digital yuan trials.BLOCKCHAIN 50 SPOTLIGHT: SQUARE Two years ago, Square, the payments company headed by Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, started letting users of Cash App, its peer-to-peer money transfer and digital banking service, buy bitcoin. The app has grown to 30 million active users and generated $3.51 billion in revenue and $75 million in gross profit from bitcoin during the first quarter of 2021, each up approximately 11x year-over-year. Square currently holds approximately $250 million worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet and is working on a bitcoin hardware wallet and a new crypto development platform.ELSEWHEREDigital bank Revolut valued at $33 billion in funding round led by SoftBank and Tiger Global [CNBC]China's Share Of Bitcoin Mining Slumped Even Before Beijing Crackdown, Research Shows [Reuters]White House announces ransomware task force—and hacking back is one option [Politico]Covering the most important news in crypto and blockchain.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," KaPow! China's government keeps trying to blow up BItcoin. In some ways, they've succeeded as over ... [+] the last six weeks the value of the world's leading crypto currency has lost around 30%.Bitcoin is still down. And I’m still blaming China for it.Last month, China banned Bitcoin mining in some inland provinces. It came at a bad time. Fresh off touting Bitcoin and Dogecoin as the next best thing after the dollar and the euro, Elon Musk said Bitcoin was bad for the environment and he was no longer accepting Bitcoin as payment for his Teslas. Bitcoin sunk. Alt-coins sunk. People blamed Musk. It was mostly China’s fault. And still is. Can we please move on now?It seems China has shot itself in the foot by going after its Bitcoin miners. The U.S. is becoming a big time miner in its wake. Kazakhstan is a top three now. Now that the Bitcoin algorithm has re-calibrated to count for fewer China miners, we don’t need China anymore. “Miners are actively migrating from large farms and taking out the equipment. We assume that industrial mining in China is dead,” says Oleg Kurchenko, Founder and CEO of Binaryx, a digital assets exchange headquartered in Estonia.China is also going against mining because it is against Bitcoin in general and wants to run its own digital currency, their digital yuan. Some smart economic pundits like Nassim Taleb think that governments, like China, are going to bring Bitcoin down to zero. The notion of Central Banks (like the Fed) driving a nail into Bitcoin’s coffin is starting to circulate among some crypto investors, especially after Jerome Powell said last week that a “digital dollar is a high priority” for the Fed. Powell has also called cryptocurrencies “not useful stores of value.”Jerome Powell: we are working on a digital dollar. And...Bitcoin is not a good store of value.Clearly, Beijing thinks the same thing. They’ve had it with Bitcoin over there. For various reasons. Their digital yuan rollout is one of them. Keeping control of a powerful currency, of course, is another one, but every government wants to do that.China's ban on crypto miners and exchanges has been going on and off since 2018, says Ian Lowe, CEO of the three year old start up Dacxi, a blockchain platform and coin run out of Australia. Dacxi operates what they call a Crypto Wealth Platform for new retail crypto investors.  “China’s more recent enforcement of these bans is in large part to de-risk the release of their own digital currency.  A digital yuan will provide unprecedented government oversight on every aspect of the Chinese economy, including making it more difficult to transfer wealth out of China,” he says, which is the main reason why Beijing hates cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin.  “The mining ban has clearly impacted the efficiency of the Bitcoin blockchain in the short term, but it's unlikely to have an enduring effect on the value of Bitcoin, because its utility and breadth of ownership has become too vast,” says Lowe.  “Will governments look to ban Bitcoin?  It's possible.  But sophisticated, regulated economies will simply regulate it in the same way they regulate financial markets already.  Very few governments see the sense in pushing the trading of Bitcoin exclusively into unregulated environments.”Over the last month, when China has taken another of its famous pop-shots against Bitcoin, the lead cryptocurrency is down over 20% with no real relief in sight. Bitfarms, a new listing in the BTC mining space, has done even worse than the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF. ... [+] Gold has been a dud, too. While the S&P 500 continues to be steady as she goes.The overall network hash rate for Bitcoin decreased by 40% initially as Chinese miners went dark. Once dominant, the mining pools concentrated in China are no longer omnipotent. If Bitcoin aficionados hate centralization, Bitcoin mining (like clothes and solar panels and iPhones and...) were centralized in China. Changes in the cryptocurrency world are happening fast, says Kurchenko. “Soon, the transported miners will operate at new locations in zones with loyal jurisdiction and low-cost electricity.”That’s already happening. Witness Kazakhstan’s rise. Why Bitfarms of Canada is still such a loser stock I will never know. I own it. I’ll keep buying it for a little while longer. But for Bitcoin investing, I’m on hold and...dare I say it...hodling. “During the last sharp rate drop of cryptocurrencies, small traders closed their positions,” says Kurchenko. “It was predictable.”Still, now that the China mining crisis is behind us, will we see $60,000 Bitcoin again? Or was that the moon landing and now we are moving on? Markets seemed more sure of Bitcoin $50,000 back in the fall of 2020 then they do Bitcoin recovering back to its all-time-high in the $60,000s.“This was not the first time the Chinese government went against Bitcoin,” says Kurchenko. “When the market is stuck in a bearish mood, it’s difficult to predict when the next crypto madness will happen and if Bitcoin will reach its prior price highs.”Some young, crypto entrepreneurs are starry-eyed still.Some in the cryptocurrency business think a new change to Bitcoin in the fall could push its value ... [+] higher, China or no China.Dave Haggard, the head of startup company Ultrasafe.Finance, says he is “very bullish on the future and months to come for Bitcoin. I feel like the worst is now behind us (on China mining).” Haggard mentioned the Taproot upgrade coming in November that could be a signal for a higher price point coming in the months ahead.Pay attention to that, Bitcoin retailers on Gemini and Robinhood.“Taproot matters, because it opens a breadth of opportunity for entrepreneurs interested in expanding bitcoin’s utility,” Alyse Killeen, founder and managing partner of bitcoin-focused venture firm Stillmark told CNBC on June 12.The ups and downs of Bitcoin may persist for the rest of the summer as markets worry about inflation. Bitcoin doesn’t seem to be a beneficiary of inflation hedges at the moment. “The upcoming Taproot upgrade should push Bitcoin back up and once we hit the next halving, Bitcoin will hit huge all-time-highs,” says Haggard, adding: “Bigger than any we have seen so far this year.”I write about global business trends, big business dramas and investing, primarily in emerging markets. I am also a retail investor with interests in cryptocurrencies, so…I write about global business trends, big business dramas and investing, primarily in emerging markets.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Price discrepancies crop up on cryptocurrency trusts. It pays to understand them.Grayscale share priceBitcoins worth $2.5 billion are lying on the sidewalk. Who’s going to pick them up?Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the granddaddy of crypto funds, owns 654,600 coins, worth $20.7 billion. But shares of the trust are trading at a combined value of $18.1 billion, a 12.3% discount.Even stranger than this discount is the premium on a rival fund. Osprey Bitcoin Trust, newer and much smaller, trades at a 27% premium.Is this crazy pricing, or what? If you want a dollar’s worth of bitcoin, you can buy it here for 88 cents or there for $1.27. Someday these discrepancies will go away—if and when the Securities & Exchange Commission allows exchange-traded funds to track crypto.A coin ETF would have market makers meeting a demand for redemptions by handing in fund shares and getting either cash or coins, and meeting a demand for new fund shares by submitting coins or cash and getting in return new shares. That revolving door would cause bitcoin funds to trade at prices very close to their asset value. Discounts and premiums would almost vanish.Both Grayscale’s and Osprey’s operators have vowed to convert their trusts into ETFs if the government ever permits those things. At that point, Grayscale’s investors would reap a windfall and Osprey’s would suffer a severe shellacking.Do investors understand this? One wonders.“We’re in the Wild West of financial products for digital assets,” says James Elbaor, who runs Marlton LLC, a Chicago investment firm that has invested in several Grayscale products. The menu includes, besides the bitcoin flagship, funds for ethereum and an assortment of lesser cryptocurrencies.Elbaor complains that Grayscale is dragging its feet on the ETF front. The SEC’s in-box contains a dozen or so applications—from Ark Invest, Fidelity, Van Eck and other firms—for crypto ETFs; conspicuously absent is anything from Grayscale or its parent firm, Digital Currency Group.Not a fair criticism, responds Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale Investments. His firm, he says, will join the ETF parade just as soon as the SEC signals that it is ready to act. Grayscale already has a bank lined up for the back-office work of running an ETF. And when an ETF format for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is approved, he vows, Grayscale will cut the 2% annual management fee on the fund, although he doesn’t say by how much.There’s a lot of loot at stake. In the first quarter of this year that 2% fee brought in $144 million of revenue from Grayscale’s bitcoin fund. Sonnenshein may find a way to preserve most of this gravy train while competing with the newcomers via a second fund.There would be ample precedent for such a dual play. When Vanguard introduced cut-rate ETFs for S&P 500 stocks and emerging-market stocks, State Street and BlackRock left in place their respective overpriced ETFs for those categories while opening discount versions on the side.Why, you might ask, would people stay put in the original Grayscale Bitcoin at, say, 1.9% a year when a Grayscale Bitcoin II can be had for maybe half the price? Because they don’t like to pay capital gain taxes.Take a look at Grayscale Bitcoin’s first-quarter report, a document that amusingly tabulates its coin holdings down to the satoshi (one one-hundred-millionth of a coin). It notes that shares worth $38 billion on March 31 had been acquired for $7 billion.For most of their glorious history, during which their net asset value has climbed 21,200%, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares have traded at a premium to their asset value. That made it possible for investors who subscribed to new shares at net asset value to wind up with a double win—coin appreciation plus the premium. It also made for a lucrative arbitrage between the coins and the shares.“There was a whole ecosystem” feeding assets to Grayscale, explains Tyler Odean, publisher of Something Interesting, a perceptive Substack newsletter on crypto. He explains: An asset manager would offer interest-bearing bitcoin accounts, tender coins to Grayscale in return for trust shares, wait the required six-month cooling-off period, unload the trust shares at a nice premium over their coin value and then use the proceeds of that sale to buy coins.The coins would be available for delivery, with interest, to the depositor. In a bull market, everyone made money: the depositor, Grayscale (with its 2%) and the arbitrageur.The ecosystem collapsed this year when Grayscale Bitcoin shares sank to a discount to their asset value. Possible explanation: Too many people playing the spread game crowded into the exit door at the same time.What might a daredevil arbitrageur do now? I’ve got two schemes to offer.The first is a bet on the SEC, not on the currency. If you think the feds will come around on ETFs, buy Grayscale (ticker: GBTC) in the over-the-counter market. Now hedge against a fall in crypto prices by shorting bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.If the SEC authorizes coin ETFs, and if Grayscale fulfills its promise, the discount will evaporate. That will give you a windfall equal to 12% of the coins involved. You could make a further profit from the contango in the futures.Contango is the spread between a spot price and a higher futures price; it reflects the cost of financing and storing a hoard of precious goods (coins, gold, whatever). Recently the bitcoin contango, as measured by the price difference between the near-month and next-month contracts, has been running at an annualized 7%.Hoped-for outcome: A year from now, the SEC grudgingly approves crypto ETFs. You make 7% rolling over the futures contracts for 12 months plus 12% from the closing of the discount on the Grayscale trust. You lose 2% to the trust’s management fee. Net gain, before accounting for trading costs: 17%.This arbitrage is not a lock. One or both legs of the transaction could turn against you. Perhaps, a year from now, the SEC is still hemming and hawing and the GBTC discount languishes at 12% or something worse than 12%. It’s also possible that the CME futures swing from contango to backwardation, the phenomenon in which commodity futures are priced below the spot price. If that happens, keeping the hedge in place makes you a little poorer every month.In short, there’s a shot at a 17% gain but some risk of getting hosed.The second play is for speculators who want to be long crypto. Instead of buying coins or Grayscale shares, you could subscribe to new shares at upstart Osprey. To do that, you send cash to the operator, getting trust shares that can’t be sold for 12 months. (Osprey is seeking permission to trim its lock-up period to six months.) You have to clear a modest net worth or income hurdle to be eligible for this trade.It’s quite possible that by the end of your lock-up, Osprey’s 27% premium will have disappeared. No great harm. You’ve simply acquired crypto at a fair price, and hold it inside a fund that is one of the better buys out there. Osprey’s 0.8% expense ratio is less than half Grayscale’s.If, on the other hand, there’s still a premium, you could cash in your Osprey shares (ticker: OBTC) and restart the process.As Chicago investor Elbaor argues, the market for digital assets is at a primitive stage, when irrational behavior can persist. Earlier this year Osprey shares were changing hands at a comical 100% premium over their asset value. Who could have been buying?But at some point, if virtual currencies continue to gather attention from retail investors and legitimacy among institutional ones, trading costs will come down, fund management fees will come down and price discrepancies will evaporate.What to do in the meantime? If you are bullish about crypto’s future, don’t wait for things to settle down, advises Tyler Odean, who bought bitcoins in 2014, during the dark days of the Mt. Gox hacking scandal: “The moment the SEC approves an ETF, you’ve probably missed a lot of the upside.”I aim to help you save on taxes and money management costs.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Bitcoin has struggled over the last few months, falling by more than half from its peak of around $65,000 set in April.The bitcoin price is still up significantly from before it began its latest rally in October, a bull run that sent combined crypto market to a staggering $2.5 trillion before crashing back (subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and discover crypto blockbusters poised for 1,000% gains).Now, a panel of cryptocurrency experts has predicted bitcoin will overtake the U.S. dollar as the dominant form of global finance by the year 2050—putting the bitcoin price at just over $66,000 by the end of 2021.Sign up now for CryptoCodex—a free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious that explains the world of bitcoin with brevity.

""Some countries will leverage bitcoin as their primary currency of choice,"" said one panelist, Thomson Reuters technologist and futurist Joseph Raczynski, who said he thinks bitcoin will overtake the dollar by 2025 with a value of $150,000. ""With fixed circulation, ease of transfer, it will serve them well to move to a 'bankless' model inherent in this ecosystem.""This year, El Salvador has adopted bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in a controversial economic experiment. Other Central and South American countries have indicated they may follow suit in an attempt to escape dependence on the dollar.However, the bitcoin price is predicted to fall further before finding a floor, with the panel consensus of $25,000 per bitcoin—down around $8,000 from its current price of around $32,000.While 54% of the panel, surveyed by personal finance comparison site Finder, expect bitcoin to eventually overtake fiat currency—sometimes called ""hyperbitcoinisation""—by the year 2050, 44% of panelists, including University of Western Australia associate professor Lee Smales, don’t expect bitcoin to ever become the dominant form of global finance.""Ultimately I think bitcoin (and many other cryptocurrency assets) will lose out to central bank digital currencies—many of which will be live by the end of the decade,"" Smales said.This week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said one of the stronger arguments for a digital dollar is that it could undermine the need for bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and so-called stablecoins, digital currencies such as tether that are pegged to traditional assets. In Europe, the E.U. has moved forward with plans to develop a digital euro over the next couple of years while China has already begun real-world trials of its digital yuan.

(Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images)Crypto is poised to set a new record for the biggest private round fundraise ever. The France-based fantasy soccer game and non-fungible token (NFT) trading platform Sorare has reportedly completed a $532 million funding round at a $3.8 billion valuation. This round would add to an already lucrative 2021 for crypto startups, which has seen the top 6 funding rounds this year collectively raise more than $1.9 billion. An NFT platform setting a new record in this climate would also counter the narrative that the vertical is losing steam after a white-hot winter.The round is reportedly led by Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank with participation from London-based venture capital firm Atomico, according to anonymous sources who spoke with Business Insider. European investment firm Eurazeo and venture capital company Blisce are also potentially involved. Sorare did not reply to requests for comment by publication time. The rumored fundraising would follow a  $50 million series A round in Feb, which was led by venture capital firm Benchmark with participation from venture capital firm Accel Partners and soccer legends themselves including Barcelona forward Antoine Griezmann and Rio Ferdinand, the former captain of Manchester United and the English national team. Sorare is an ethereum-based fantasy soccer game where players trade and manage a virtual team with digital player cards in the form of NFTs. In addition to gaming applications, the digital player cards are officially-licensed collectibles featuring superstar soccer players like Alphonso Davies or Mark McKenzie. Since its founding in 2018, Sorare has partnered with 142 soccer clubs including Real Madrid S.F., Liverpool F.C. and Sporting Clube de Portugal, to issue new player cards. In the past 30 days alone Sorare has facilitated 43,933 sales with a total value over over $9 million, according to data from Nonfungible.com. The top sale over the past 30 days was an Antoine Griezmann unique player card, meaning only one is issued per season, which sold for 50.8 ETH worth $114,916."
2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 13: President and CEO of JPMorgan Chase Co. Jamie Dimon arrives to testify ... [+] before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Capitol Hill June 13, 2012 in Washington, DC. The committee is hearing testimony from Mr. Dimon on how JP Morgan Chase lost over’s two billion dollars in stock market trades. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)Flying in the face of crypto skeptic, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, two senior analysts at his firm argued in a report this week that as blockchains running more energy-efficient networks than bitcoin and ethereum increase in popularity, a new way to make money, called staking, will gain traction as a source of revenue for institutional and retail investors alike. Currently, the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains use an energy-demanding process called proof-of-work to ensure all transactions on the network are valid and that the network’s distributed record is accurate. In order to create a more scalable and energy-efficient system, blockchain development teams, including the progenitor of the decentralized finance movement, ethereum, are switching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, where investors lock-up their funds on the blockchain in exchange for rewards. According to the report, staking today generates an estimated $9 billion worth of revenue annually for the crypto industry. Authors predict that ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake after the launch of long-anticipated ethereum 2.0 next year will spur adoption of the alternative consensus mechanism and could cause staking pay-outs to balloon to $20 billion in the quarters following the launch of Ethereum 2.0 and $40 billion by 2025. “Not only does staking lower the opportunity cost of holding cryptocurrencies versus other asset classes, but in many cases cryptocurrencies pay a significant nominal and real yield,” the report reads. Currently staking cryptocurrencies like SOL or BNB can earn yields ranging from 4% to as high as 10% annually, according to data from stakingrewards.com. The Winklevoss crypto exchange Gemini for example, currently advertises to  investors the chance to earn annual yields up to 7.4% on their crypto balances. The report also says that as the volatility of cryptocurrencies declines, the ability to earn a positive real return will be an important factor in helping the market become more mainstream.The report’s authors predicted that staking will become a growing source of income for cryptocurrency intermediaries like Coinbase, especially after Ethereum 2.0 which is scheduled to be complete in 2022. The report estimates that staking presents a $200 million revenue opportunity for Coinbase in 2022, up from $10.4 million in 2020.J.P. Morgan has dabbled in the crypto market since 2018 through its Blockchain Center of Excellence. In 2019, the bank launched its own stablecoin representing the US dollar, JPMCoin. In March, J.P. Morgan even began offering clients bitcoin exposure.“Yield earned through staking can mitigate the opportunity cost of owning cryptocurrencies versus other investments in other asset classes such as US dollars, US Treasuries, or money market funds in which investments generate some positive nominal yield,” the report reads. “In fact, in the current zero rate environment, we see the yields as an incentive to invest.”The current market capitalization of proof-of-stake tokens is over $150 billion, according to the report. Authors predict that the ability to use crypto assets to earn yield through staking will make digital assets a more attractive asset class and could help to grow mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum 2.0 was originally supposed to launch in January 2020, and is now expected to enter its final launch phase in 2022. However, the potential ability to earn consistent positive yield through staking cryptocurrencies is dependent on market volatility. For example, ethereum competitor Solana lets investors take the native SOL cryptocurrency, currently valued at $32.76, and earn SOL rewards. If the value of the SOL token were to tank, there would be no real gains. This is true of any staking cryptocurrency. As the crypto market matures and volatility decreases, staking will likely become a more reliable source of revenue. An additional concern raised by the report is the inflation inherent to any system that consistently mints new tokens. As more people participate in a staking system, the more diluted the value of a single token and the less individuals are rewarded, if there are not strict inflation-control mechanisms. Sticking with the SOL example from earlier, the Solana development team has released an inflation schedule designed to minimize these concerns and  set a long-term inflation rate target of 1.5%."
2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," The value of major cryptocurrencies—including bitcoin, ethereum, cardano and ripple—fell Wednesday after China’s Anhui province announced sweeping plans to ban cryptocurrency mining, the latest region to block the power-hungry practice as Beijing intensifies its crackdown on the industry.Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process.Bitcoin fell roughly 4% Wednesday morning to just over $31,500 a token, its lowest point in nearly three weeks, after the province announced plans to phase out cryptocurrency mining within three years.The ban, reported on by Bloomberg and Reuters citing state media, is intended to help ease expected power shortages in the province and tackle growing demand for electricity.      China is the source of the majority of the world’s cryptocurrency trade—a 2020 study found it to account for nearly 80% of global bitcoin operations—though Anhui is not a major location for miners. The ban comes amid a wider crackdown on the crypto industry in China and follows similar initiatives to outlaw the power-hungry process in the mining hub provinces of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Yunnan and Sichuan. Other major cryptocurrencies, which often mirror bitcoin’s movements, also fell Wednesday morning, with ether, cardano and ripple all losing between 5-6.5%.In May this year, Beijing renewed and intensified efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies in China, citing environmental concerns and a need to preserve order and stability. Beijing banned crypto exchanges in 2017 and authorities are increasingly focusing their efforts on bitcoin mining, the process through which bitcoin is awarded to computers solving complex problems. The computer systems needed to mine bitcoin consume vast amounts of energy, which is available cheaply and in abundance in China, though often from dirty sources at odds with China’s climate goals. The crackdown in China has prompted some major crashes across the crypto market and blunted interest in major tokens like bitcoin, which at around $31,500 is currently worth less than half its all-time high of almost $64,000 in April.      Cryptocurrency trading volume plunges as interest wanes following bitcoin price drop (CNBC) Major Cryptocurrencies—Including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin—Plummet As China Widens Crackdown (Forbes)China Cracks Down On Crypto Business, Saying ‘Speculative’ Trading ‘Seriously Infringing’ On Financial Order (Forbes)Bitcoin’s growing energy problem: ‘It’s a dirty currency’ (FT)I am a London-based reporter for Forbes covering breaking news.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," British police have confiscated around $250 million worth of cryptocurrency as part of an ongoing money laundering investigation, London’s Metropolitan Police announced Tuesday, marking one of the largest crypto seizures in the world and breaking a record the force set last month. London police seized millions in cryptocurrency, though it is unclear which tokens were taken.The seizure, which follows a $160 million crypto haul the force made three weeks ago, is part of an ongoing investigation into international money laundering by the force’s Economic Crime Command.It comes after a 39-year-old woman was arrested on “suspicion of money laundering offenses” on June 24 after the first cache was confiscated and the woman was subsequently released on bail, the force said.The woman was interviewed again last weekend—this time under caution—after the latest discovery was made and has been bailed until late July.     Detective Constable Joe Ryan said the “seizure is another significant landmark in this investigation which will continue for months to come as we hone in on those at the centre of this suspected money laundering operation.”The force did not disclose what cryptocurrencies had been confiscated. Cryptocurrencies are traded digitally, relatively anonymous, have low barriers to entry, can be convenient to use and are international by nature, making them an attractive prospect to some criminals. While most crypto transactions are legitimate, the specter of financial crime has become a strong motivator for regulators around the world to bolster scrutiny of digital assets. With growing demand for cryptocurrency services, in part spurred on by a growth in value for many major assets and meme tokens during parts of the Covid-19 pandemic, many major financial institutions have moved into crypto markets, including JPMorgan, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock. Despite this, regulatory uncertainty hinders mainstream acceptance and leaves consumers relatively unprotected. Money laundering is a commonly-touted concern among regulators, as is tax fraud, terrorism, and drug trafficking. The digital assets are also the payment method of choice for ransomware hackers, which adds to calls for enhanced regulatory scrutiny.While the “proceeds of crime are laundered in many different ways,” Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty said, organized criminals are increasingly “using cryptocurrency to launder their dirty money.” However, McNulty added: “Cash still remains king in the criminal world.”U.K. Police Seize $160 Million In Cryptocurrency In Money Laundering Investigation (Forbes)Met police seize nearly £180m of bitcoin in money laundering investigation (Guardian)Ransomware Hackers Demand $70 Million In Bitcoin, Claim Massive U.S. Attack As Biden Investigates Possible Russian Involvement (Forbes)I am a London-based reporter for Forbes covering breaking news.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Bitcoin prices may be headed for a serious breakout, some analysts predict. Bitcoin prices have been suffering from a distinct malaise lately, trading within a reasonably defined range for several weeks. Since late May, the digital currency has been stuck mostly between $30,000 and $42,000, CoinDesk figures show. In spite of this, some market observers have claimed that the digital currency is not only poised to break free of its current range, but could experience some serious upside while doing so. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, the CEO of payments company BCB Group, spoke to this recently. “All the on-chain analysis suggests we’re at the tight end of a slingshot,” he told CoinDesk. “It’s quiet now but don’t mistake that for lack of interest.”Potentially ‘Explosive’ Gains Scott Melker, a crypto investor and analyst who is the host of The Wolf Of All Streets Podcast, offered his two cents. “Bitcoin price has been consolidating in a tight range between 42K and 30K for over 8 weeks, with decreasing volume and volatility,” he noted. “The longer an asset’s price consolidates, the larger the expected expansion when volume and volatility return. We have seen this countless times with Bitcoin, so the expectation is that the next move will be explosive,” said Melker. “On-chain analysis indicates that supply is being transferred from impatient speculators to Bitcoin whales with large wallets, with new wallets selling and old, larger wallets buying.”“This theoretically indicates that the smart money is accumulating ahead of the next major move to the upside.”Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst of TrendSpider, provided a differing point of view, stating that: “I disagree in the short-term. I would argue the tension is currently to the downside as those that are holding Bitcoin need to capitulate to reset the price.”“The anchored VWAP from the covid lows points to a level of $27k below to watch out for short-term.”“Based on the historical seasonality, we are entering one of the weakest months of the year next month with only a 20% win rate for August over the last 5 years,” he added.Assessing ProbabilitiesJeff Dorman, chief investment officer of asset manager Arca, offered a third perspective. “Bitcoin is a binary option. It's either worth close to $0, or it's worth likely $10 trillion (implying roughly $500k/BTC),” he stated. “Everything in between is just a path function based on the increased or decreased probabilities and timing of hitting either of these extremes.” “Earlier this year, those probabilities rose as inflation talk was rising, corporate treasurers were buying, and Elon Musk gave retail traders confidence,” said Dorman. “Over the past three months, those probabilities fell as Elon pulled out, ESG fears sprang up, and China cracked down,” he stated.“Traders can use any mumbo-jumbo they want about ‘tension’ and ‘breakouts,’ but the reality is it is meaningless compared to how you assess probabilities.” Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS.

The FBI alert, first reported by Bleeping Computer, cautions users to be aware of attacks using technical support fraud, phone sim swapping, and identity theft.Sim swapping, when the attacker requests a carrier transfer a phone number to a new sim card giving them access to incoming SMS messages and calls, has exploded in popularity in recent years, prompting a warning from the FBI in 2019 and guidance from the Federal Trade Commission. The increase in criminals targetting those holding bitcoin and digital currencies comes after the bitcoin price surged to around $65,000 per bitcoin in April, up from around $10,000 last year, before crashing back. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $32,000. Other smaller cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and the meme-based dogecoin, have seen even bigger price increases. ""Cybercriminals are targeting cryptocurrency users, exchanges, and third-party payment platforms in the virtual asset industry, resulting in large amounts of financial loss to victims,"" the FBI alert, issued via a system for distributing sensitive information to selected groups and individuals called the Traffic Light Protocol, reportedly read.Once the stolen cryptocurrency has been transferred to attacker-controlled accounts it can be hard for law enforcement to recover it, the FBI warned.The FBI advised financial and crypto companies to check the origin of emails and keep an eye on recently created accounts while those buying bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were encouraged to use multi-factor authentication—meaning they must have access to at least two devices or accounts linked to the platform—avoid download requests, remote access applications and any unofficial company communication channels.CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Saul Loeb/AFP/BloombergDuring testimony on Wednesday afternoon before the U.S. Financial Services Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made clear that while the central bank is continuing to study the feasibility of a digital dollar, it will not be forced into launching one or succumb to outside pressure from other countries that are jumping out ahead.Additionally, he noted that when the US launches a sovereign digital currency, it could make cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or stablecoins such as Tether unnecessary. “One of the arguments that are offered in favor of a digital currency in particular you wouldn't need stablecoins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency” said Powell when asked by Representative Stephen Lynch (D-MA 8th) about the potential benefits that swift action by the Fed would have on digital currencies. Currently, the Fed is working on a report expected to be published in September, pushed back from July, that seeks to expand on  benefits, risks, and considerations that must be taken into account when it comes to forms of digital payments, such as  crypto assets, stablecoins and the formation of a CBDC. This builds on work that the Fed undertook last year when it partnered with an MIT digital currency initiative to explore the idea of a CBDC. “That whole group of issues and payment mechanisms, which we think are at a critical point, in terms of appropriate regulations and in the case of the CBDC, laying out really, questions for the public to respond to about what good it can do, what the cost and benefits of it would be.” says Powell on what exactly the study would cover. That said, a strong argument could be made that the U.S. is falling behind when it comes to developing a CBDC. China is getting close to implementing the digital yuan, last year the Bahamas went live with the first CBDC, and today the European Central Bank launched the next phase of its digital euro project. In fact, according to a January 2021 study by the Bank for International Settlements, 86% of central banks have begun to explore CBDCs in some shape or form.These developments are not lost on certain lawmakers. During his questioning, Rep. Lynch expressed concerns to Powell that if the Fed took too long in exploring the idea of a CBDC the U.S. could inadvertently give up its status as the reserve currency.That said, Powell remains firm that the U.S status as a reserve currency has no other competitor. “The US is the reserve currency. There really isn't a good competitor out there because all the things you need to be the reserve currency really the United States has it.” As for getting into CBDC’s, Powell cautions that there are risks as well as benefits but notes that it depends on each country's circumstances. “I think it’s way more important to do it right, than to do it fast,” adds Powell. Finally, Representative Patrick McHenry (R-NC 10th) also probed Chairman Powell regarding any concerns he may have about the implementation of digital assets such as stablecoins, which has grown in popularity with even Visa announcing it will settle payments in USDC, a competitor to industry leader Tether.In response, Powell compared stablecoins to money market funds and even bank deposits but without the regulations both adhere to. Powell notes that historically the U.S. has had a strong regulatory framework for other assets such as money market funds but digital assets like stablecoins have limited regulations. “That doesn’t exist really for stablecoins and if they are going to be a significant part of the payments universe, which we don't think crypto assets or even stablecoins might be, then we need an appropriate regulatory framework which we don't have.” says Powell."

[+] 13-year highBitcoin continues to squeeze into a tight consolidation range of low-$30,000s, trading at $32,511, more than 4% down on the week, as of 7:10 a.m. ET, according to crypto data aggregator COIN360. The cryptocurrency, promoted as a hedge against inflation but still seen as a risky asset, took a slight dip on the news of an uptick in inflation yesterday. Per a report from the Labor Department, the consumer price index, measuring the average change in prices paid for goods and services, increased 5.4% from a year earlier, the largest jump since August 2008.Bitcoin price according to CoinbaseMeanwhile bitcoin’s 7-day volatility keeps declining and currently sits at 2.76%, while the 30-day volatility is now back to March levels when bitcoin consolidated above $50,000, according to analysis from Norwegian crypto analytics firm Arcane Research. This dampened volatility matches trading activity in the derivatives markets, where open interest is stalling and trading volumes are falling to 2021 lows, data from Glassnode shows. Since the May sell-off, futures open interest has remained bound between $10.7 billion and $13 billion, 57% below the all-time high set in April when Coinbase went public. Volumes across futures markets have fallen 62.5% and 49% compared to May and June highs respectively, now standing at $45 billion in futures traded per day. Bitcoin Futures VolumeGlassnode analysts write, “With such a significant decline across all derivatives markets, it becomes increasingly likely that market volatility will be driven by spot volumes, rather than short/long squeezes or leveraged liquidations.” In June, trading volumes at major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase and Kraken, fell by more than 40% compared to the previous month, according to crypto market data provider CryptoCompare.This sentiment is mirrored by Jehan Chu, founder and managing partner of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital. In a message to Forbes he wrote, “Lower prices, volume, and sentiment are working together to create further downward pressure on the crypto markets. With a lack of positive sentiment in both the crypto and macroeconomic markets, we can expect sideways and downward movement for the near term, while whales and institutions continue to slowly add to their positions and consolidate a floor.”Altcoins are also trading in the red. Ether fell below $2,000 for the first time this month yesterday and continues to trade south of that level, worth $1,950 as of press time.

Meanwhile, bitcoin rival ethereum is also grappling with eye-watering volatility as a sell-off that began in May drags on.While ethereum has seen a flood of adoption and attention this year thanks to the twin decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFTs) crazes—both almost entirely built on ethereum's blockchain—the ethereum price has swung even more wildly than bitcoin.But despite its heavy losses over the last few weeks, those who have invested and work with the technology remain confident it can succeed. ""With ethereum, you are betting on the adoption of a protocol in the realm of decentralized finance and smart controls,"" J.P. Theriot, the chief executive of New York-based digital money platform Uphold, said in emailed comments. ""The genie is out of the bottle, and it isn't going back in.""I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

2021-07-08T18:35:00-04:00," Prices of major cryptocurrencies according to data aggregator COIN360Led by bitcoin, most major cryptocurrencies have spent the past seven days in relative tranquility. Bitcoin and ether have been trading -0.69% and -4.46% on the week respectively, according to crypto data aggregator COIN360. The biggest movers are Binance’s BNB, which has added 6.95% over the same period, and Dogecoin, which is down by 8.28%. As of 8.06 a.m. ET, bitcoin is still facing resistance at $33,576 though on-chain metrics are becoming more bullish. For instance, “bitcoin exchange balances have started to show signs of sustained outflows,” tweeted blockchain data and intelligence provider Glassnode. Approximately 40,000 BTC, or $1.37 billion, have been withdrawn over the last three weeks, reversing weeks of inflows that coincided with the 50% market crash. The withdrawals suggest that traders are moving their funds to outside wallets and aren’t looking to sell in the near term. That said, there have been some standouts among altcoins. EOS, the native cryptocurrency of the EOS.IO blockchain platform, rallied nearly 11% in the last few days following the announcement that crypto startup Bullish is preparing for a public listing via a $9 billion SPAC deal. During the past year, Bullish received an initial capital injection of $100 million and digital assets, including 20 million EOS, from Block.one, the company behind EOS. Additionally, Block.one’s CEO Brendan Blumer will become the chairman of Bullish upon the transaction’s close. Another big altcoin winner of the week is Terra (LUNA), a native token of the namesake protocol for issuing fiat-pegged stablecoins,  – up by 30.86%. The token seems to have found its footing after the volatility it saw in May subsided. On July 7, Terraform Labs, the project’s creator, committed approximately $70 million to boost the reserves of its savings protocol Anchor. LUNA’s market capitalization has leaped from $300 million to $3.4 billion since January. Price of LUNA according to Binance (calculated by TradingView)But all eyes will be on one of the largest releases of locked shares (16,240) in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), bound to take place on July 17. In total, 40,000 shares will become unlocked in the coming weeks. The trust, set up as a private placement where qualified investors can buy shares directly from Grayscale, requires investors to hold their shares for six months before selling them on the secondary market. GBTC saw massive interest in late 2020 and early 2021 among institutions looking for a simple way to get exposure to bitcoin. Opinions on the impact of the event on the market differ. JPMorgan strategists think the selling will add pressure on the cryptocurrency. “Selling of GBTC shares exiting the six-month lockup period during June and July has emerged as an additional headwind for bitcoin,” wrote the bank’s analysts in a note issued earlier in June. “Despite some improvement, our signals remain overall bearish.”Analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, however, seem to disagree: “market structure suggests that the unlock will not weigh materially on BTC spot markets anytime soon, if at all, like some have claimed.” Whether or not the unlock creates a catalyst for price action, it remains one of the most anticipated events of the week.I report on cryptocurrencies and emerging use cases of blockchain.
