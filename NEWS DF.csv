Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up 2.7% to over $2,600 in the same time period.“Bitcoin is rallying as risky assets finish a very bad January on a positive note,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, the Americas, wrote in his daily market update. “Bitcoin bullish momentum is slowly building up and it could surprise to the upside if the dollar continues to weaken as much of the Fed tightening for the year begins to get priced in.”Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major crypto exchanges was significantly lower than a week ago. Many stock indexes in Asia were closed amid the weeklong lunar New Year (also known as Chinese New Year) holidays. Many crypto traders in the region may also have taken time off.Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges reported nearly $100 billion in trading volume in January, according to href=""https://dune.xyz/hagaetc/dex-metrics""Dune Analytics. The total trading volume in DEXs previously dropped significantly following its peak last May.

Feb 1 2022 5:36 AM ,"The price of bitcoin held steady early Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) terminated its liquidity-boosting bond purchase program, also known as quantitative easing (QE), and tamed rate hike fears.The Australian central bank href=""https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2022/mr-22-02.html"" target=""_blank""announced an end of the weekly A$4 billion ($2.8 billion) in government bond purchases and maintained the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.1%. Most economists had predicted an end of the QE, with the jobless rate dipping to a 13-year low of 4.2% and core inflation surging to seven-year highs of 2.6%.RBA's decision to end QE comes on the heels of markets pricing an aggressive tightening cycle in the U.S. Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to end its bond purchases in March and set the stage for a rate hike in the same month. Markets are now priced for five quarter percentage point Fed rate hikes by the end of the year.While the RBA followed the Fed's lead on ending QE, the Australian central bank pushed back against rate hike expectations. ""Ceasing purchases under the bond purchase program does not imply a near-term increase in interest rates,"" Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement. ""The board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve.""Ahead of the decision, markets were expecting a rate hike in May, followed by another four hikes by December.RBA's dovish tone weighed over the Aussie dollar, sending AUD/USD down 50 percentage points (pips) towards 0.70 and perhaps helping bitcoin and other risk assets maintain overnight gains.The top cryptocurrency by market cap traded largely unchanged on the day, changing hands at about $38,560 at 04:55 UTC. It rose 1.5% on Monday. Australia's benchmark equity index, S&amp;P ASX 200, traded 0.5% higher, while the futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 0.2%.Bitcoin has nearly halved in value since peaking at nearly $69,000 on Nov. 10, predominantly because of fears of faster Fed tightening. The cryptocurrency's fortunes are closely tied with the equity markets, with the 60-day correlation between the two assets now at 65% versus virtually zero in 2017. The sensitivity to stock market gyrations and macro factors like central bank decisions perhaps stems from increased institutional participation. Besides, bitcoin has been one of the inflation trades.""Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in an increasingly digital world,"" Fidelity Digital Assets' analysts wrote in their monthly note.While macro factors appear to have aligned in favor of the bears, on-chain activity paints a positive picture.According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, 40,785 bitcoins left exchanges last week, registering the highest weekly exodus of coins since September. ""The continued trend of coins moving to cold wallets is historically good for long-term price movements,"" href=""https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1488296857373536259"" target=""_blank""Santiment tweeted."

Feb 2 2022 7:18 PM ,"As markets swoon in the face of the Federal Reserve's recent href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126a.htm"" target=""_blank""pivot to tackle inflation, some crypto analysts are already calling the U.S. central bank's bluff.Bitcoin prices have plunged alongside stocks as the Fed moves to reverse nearly two years of emergency monetary stimulus. But some top crypto analysts argue that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues may quickly back off from their new campaign to tighten monetary policy – due to worries that traditional markets, the banking system and the real economy can’t handle the higher borrowing costs.The analysis gets at the heart of economists' debates these days over the Fed's willingness to maintain the hawkish stance if the economy starts to go into recession or if stock prices suddenly tank. It goes back to the ""href=""https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/08/03/Poole.pdf""Fed put"" – the notion that investors can count on getting bailed out by the U.S. central bank without having to worry about unlimited downside.The theory is that bitcoin prices might jump if the Fed were to reverse course and halt the tightening or even start stimulating markets again to prevent a recession – and to preserve the soundness of the traditional financial system. The Fed is widely expected to start raising interest rates next month for the first time since 2018, and to keep tightening monetary conditions over the course of the year.Even before the Fed gets going, some analysts are already starting to handicap when the U.S. central bank might start to ease up.“I anticipate that we are to see some slowdown in” the pace of Fed monetary-policy tightening, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda. “If there’s some cracks in the economy and the Fed goes slower, that is going to provide a spark here for bitcoin.”During a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20220126.pdf""press conference last week, Powell noted that the economy has reached the point – with inflation ticking up and coronavirus cases waning – when the time for extreme monetary stimulus has passed.“The economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support,” Powell said.But he left himself ample wiggle room to maneuver in case the outlook changes.""Of course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain,"" Powell said. ""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes.Big Wall Street firms aren't completely in sync on how fast the Fed will move to tighten monetary policy, but they're in agreement on the general trajectory: Bank of America predicts seven 0.25 percentage point rate hikes this year, while JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank forecast five and Morgan Stanley sees four.Coinbase Institutional Research analyst David Duong said he's skeptical that the Fed will be able to keep cranking monetary conditions tighter if markets start to weaken.He noted Powell's use of the term ""financial stability"" – often invoked by the Fed as a reason for loosening monetary policy. When the spread of the coronavirus in March 2020 sent global asset prices reeling, the U.S. central bank cited the threats to financial stability as a reason to pump trillions of emergency liquidity into money markets.""I heard the phrase 'financial stability' more than once,"" Duong told CoinDesk last week in a video interview. ""I take that as a signal that they are saying, We are concerned about financial stability, what’s happening in the market.""No one knows for sure how much stock market decline the Fed can tolerate. Among analysts who spoke with CoinDesk, most guessed 20% to 30%.“I doubt the Fed will act decisively,” Duke University finance professor Campbell R. Harvey wrote in email to CoinDesk,Market expectations, he said, are that the Fed will hike interest rates by 0.25 percentage point in March and another percentage point over the rest of the year. He said ""that seems trivial"" considering that inflation is running around 7%, with the Fed's benchmark interest rate currently around 0.08%.Garrick Hileman, head of research at href=""http://blockchain.com/"" target=""_blank""Blockchain.com and a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said that inflation might prove to be less daunting, which could give the Fed more room to ease off.“We are not in an extremely unstable inflation right now,” he said. “Many sectors are deflationary. Tech is deflationary. These are all forces helping the Fed manage inflation.”"

Feb 3 2022 11:40 AM ,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has emerged as one of the most href=""https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/09/most-influential-40-jerome-powell/"" target=""_blank""influential entities in the bitcoin market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. What's not clear are the roles of other major central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BOE).According to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at CoinDesk's sister company Genesis Global Trading, those banks' actions matter to traders holding cryptocurrencies in euros, the official currency of 19 of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), and the British pound.""We're so used to watching crypto in dollars; we forget that for many, performance is decided by relative movements in local currencies,"" Acheson told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Also, many traders borrow in local currencies to trade, so higher borrowing costs will eat into their profits.""The BOE on Thursday raised official borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 0.5%, matching estimates. The central bank's policy statement showed four members voted for a 50 basis-point hike, signaling the potential for a faster tightening than historical standards. Officials unanimously voted to begin shrinking the balance sheet.The central bank was widely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points, while pushing back against market expectations of a total of five quarter-percentage-point hikes by the end of 2023. ""Most were already discounting a raise from the BOE, but not the ECB,"" Acheson said.The ECB, as expected, kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25%, while maintaining that higher inflation will fade by year end. Dessislava Aubert, senior research analyst at Paris-based crypto market data provider Kaiko, said the growing monetary policy divergence between the Fed and the ECB might lead to a stronger dollar and weaker bitcoin.""While the Fed is expected to hike rates several times this year, the ECB has adopted a more sequential and slow-go approach to monetary policy tightening – explicitly ruling out a rate hike for this year. This will likely impact the U.S. currency relative to the euro,"" Aubert said in a WhatsApp chat.""There is already a rate differential, with between the U.S. yields which have increased since November and German yields which are up only a little. Stronger dollar is generally bearish for equities and bitcoin with BTC moving in the opposite direction to the greenback over the past months,"" Aubert added.The BOE and ECB rate decisions failed to inject volatility into the bitcoin market, leaving the cryptocurrency largely steady at under $37,000.Europe has been a major source of demand for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Both the ECB and BOE have contributed to the two-year global liquidity deluge commonly associated with the Fed and have fueled unprecedented risk-taking in financial markets.Data tracked by href=""https://terminal.bytetree.com/bitcoin/flows"" target=""_blank""ByteTree Asset Management shows the number of bitcoin held by U.S. and Canadian closed-ended funds and Canadian and European exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has risen 165% since early 2020 to 842,153 BTC.A href=""https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/central-northern-western-europe-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2021-preview/"" target=""_blank""Chainalysis report released in October mentioned Europe as the world's largest crypto market. ""Central, Northern, &amp; Western Europe (CNWE) has the biggest cryptocurrency economy in the world, receiving over $1 trillion worth of cryptocurrency over the last year, which represents 25% of global activity,"" the blockchain analytics firm said.Together, the Fed, the ECB, BOE, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have $27 trillion worth of assets, according to Bloomberg. That's up from $14 trillion at the start of 2020. Thus, monetary policy revisions by the European and North American central banks can influence bitcoin's price.""Broader monetary policy trends do matter for the medium term as it sets the tone for global liquidity and global risk appetite,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in a Telegram chat.While central banks in advanced nations have worked in tandem to flood the global economy with cash, the Fed sets the worldwide narrative and draws the most attention from financial markets.""While all macro decisions matter, the Fed is the most important as it drives the global policy,"" said Charlie Morris, founder and chief investment officer of ByteTree Asset Management.The Fed is widely seen as the lender of the last resort because of the dollar's global reserve status, as explained in a Council on Foreign Relations article href=""https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/dollar-worlds-currency"" target=""_blank""dated September 2020. The popular theory states that the dollar's reserve status ensures constant demand for the greenback in the global market. That allows the Fed, in theory, to print to infinity without worrying about sharp currency depreciation and a surge in inflation.The U.S. central bank has taken a sharp hawkish turn since November, retiring the word ""transitory"" from inflation discussions, setting the stage for at least four interest rate hikes this year and an end to the liquidity-boosting bond-buying program in March.Bitcoin, widely touted as an inflation hedge, has declined by 45% since mid-November, predominantly due to the Fed jitters.Speculation of href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/fed-sets-stage-for-most-aggressive-global-tightening-in-decades"" target=""_blank""global tightening has been doing the rounds since the Fed's hawkish turn. Thus, impending anti-stimulus comments or actions from other central banks, if any, may not have a significant negative impact on bitcoin.On the flip side, the battered cryptocurrency may see a relief rally if the likes of ECB squash fears of aggressive monetary policy tightening, though the central bank has little room to do so given inflation is running at multiyear highs. ""If ECB and BOE do not pull the trigger, this will offer up some short-term tailwinds with the price of bitcoin,"" said Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETF expert and director of CEC Capital.That said, overall, the environment for risk assets, including bitcoin, is gloomy, according to Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange. ""The cryptocurrency could continue to trade sideways until bottom fishing emerges,"" Balani told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp call. ""That looks unlikely as long as macro factors remain bearish.""UPDATE (Feb. 3, 12:23 UTC): Updates with BOE's rate decision; removes ""Preview"" from headline.UPDATE (Feb. 3, 13:07 UTC): Adds ECB decisionUPDATE (Feb. 3, 13:47 UTC): Adds quote from Kaiko"

Feb 4 2022 2:01 PM ,"The U.S. added 467,000 jobs in January, widely beating economists' forecasts as employers scrambled to cope with the Omicron variant as well as an unusually tight labor market.Bitcoin was trading slightly lower after the report, possibly because the faster-than-expected jobs growth might keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary conditions – seen as a negative in cryptocurrency markets.The U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics published its latest employment situation report Friday in a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"" target=""_blank""statement. The January number was much higher than economists' average estimate of 150,000 in a Dow Jones survey, though some economists had warned that the variability from Omicron and other data-related issues might make the latest report harder to analyze.""Employment growth continued in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in retail trade, and in transportation and warehousing,"" the bureau said.Crypto traders were monitoring the report because many investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and a tighter jobs market could put upward pressure on wages – which businesses might in turn try to pass through to consumers in the form of higher retail prices.Bitcoin was down 1% in the minutes after the report was released to about $37,500.The number of jobs added in December was revised higher by 311,000 jobs to 510,000.The unemployment rate was ""little changed"" at 4% in December, according to the report.A hot labor market could put pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates sooner than later, as more spending could drive inflation up even higher. More pressure from the Fed could weaken bitcoin returns, according to some analysts.“If the data suggests the Fed will need to be more aggressive with rate hikes, look out for more risk-off flow, which for the time being, will continue to have a negative impact on crypto,"" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Digital.Economists were warning even before the January jobs report came out that the data might be messy because of the unpredictable and wide-ranging impact on employers and workers from Omicron.The count of jobs gained or lost is measured through a survey that asks employers for the number of workers they have on their payrolls during the period of measuring. That excludes workers who were out sick, or missed work for other reasons, like taking care of someone or quarantining. Those people still kept their jobs, but they weren’t accounted for in the report, which is why the number could be misleading.The main question now is how seriously the Fed takes the data reported this month, considering the significant measurement issues and how it will affect the central bank’s decision in the upcoming weeks.The labor participation rate, which measures the percentage of the American population that is either working or actively looking for work, was 62.6%, up from 61.9% in December."

The largest cryptocurrency remains well off its all-time high of around $69,000 reached in December.""Several attacks on the downside have not been successful anymore as the risk has been taken out,"" said Daniel Kukan, a senior trader at Crypto Finance AG.Kukan said his next target for the price level on the upside is about $42,000 to $43,000. He sees market support at $33,000 – or $28,000 in the worst case, ""which we have not touched.""On an intraday basis, bitcoin has pierced above the top of its weeklong price range, after holding support above the $35,000 to $37,000 zone.Bitcoin dipped briefly after the U.S. Labor Department reported href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/04/us-jobs-report-shows-gain-of-467000-in-january-exceeding-expectations/"" target=""_blank""unexpectedly strong jobs growth in January, along with big upward revisions to the figures previously reported for 2021.Theoretically, such a report would be negative for bitcoin, because the Federal Reserve might need to move more aggressively in hiking interest rates to keep the labor market from overheating. In general, bitcoin's price has responded negatively to tighter monetary policy.""Bitcoin's initial knee-jerk reaction to the shockingly strong nonfarm payroll report was weakness,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda.But he noted that ""bitcoin has managed to stabilize despite rising inflationary pressures that continue to push global bond yields higher.""The 10-year Treasury yield broke above a two week-long range of 1.92%. And the U.S. dollar also ticked higher over the past two hours, while stocks are roughly flat. Bitcoin often trades in sync with stocks.Jason Deane, bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said that ""bitcoin's recent moves do seem to have coincided with the latest U.S. jobs report, and it's possible this may simply have acted as catalyst for an overdue market move.""Separately, the market may have gotten an extra dose of bullishness when href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/04/2379299/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-Announces-Bitcoin-Production-and-Mining-Operation-Updates-for-January-2022.html"" target=""_blank""Marathon Digital Holdings, a bitcoin mining company in North America, said Friday it had increasing its holdings of the cryptocurrency to about 8,595 BTC ($338 million).Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, described that as a ""mammoth increase.""""I think this may well be related to the small push up,"" Kssis said."

CoinDesk Insights,"Earlier in the week, MicroStrategy announced it purchased $25 million in bitcoin (BTC) in January. CEO Michael Saylor joined crypto podcast “href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09JD_ZTCKds""UpOnly” to reveal the back story of his company’s move to href=""https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/01/microstrategy-buys-additional-25m-worth-of-bitcoin-during-market-dip/""accumulate 125,051 bitcoin in 2020 and 2021.Founded in the late 1980s by Saylor, MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a publicly traded business intelligence and software provider, but it is now better known for the $4.7 billion in bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet.You’re reading href=""https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/""Crypto Long &amp; Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. href=""https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/""Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.Before buying all that bitcoin, it was already one of the largest independent, publicly traded companies in its industry. In 2020, its revenue was nearly $480 million and it had an enviable 8.29% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin in the trailing 12 months before its first BTC purchase. When discussing the company's position during the “UpOnly” podcast, Saylor said, “It's profitable, that's what we are. We love it, we’ll keep doing it. But you can't really scale it.”He then claimed that while the company was profitable, it wasn’t viable to reinvest profits into hiring sprees or increasing marketing spending. That makes MicroStrategy a cash cow that keeps collecting cash on its balance sheet.That sounds like a good problem to have, except it becomes a problem if those accumulated dollars start diminishing in value because of inflation.The Federal Reserve’s response in 2020 to COVID-19 with massive quantitative easing helped push the equities market to new highs, with investors favoring speculative growth stocks such as Tesla (TSLA) and tech monopolies such as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN). Soaring stock prices allows those companies to make larger acquisitions and use their valuations to expand their operations with historically cheap capital, sending their stocks higher again, rinse and repeat.One stock that wasn’t rallying was MicroStrategy’s. In fact, it was a laggard for several years even before the pandemic hit. From the start of 2017 to the beginning of March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 31% while MicroStrategy shares fell 31%. The Federal Reserve’s pandemic QE response didn’t change things for MicroStrategy. As the S&amp;P 500 and many growth stocks approached the highs again just three months after March 2020’s crash, MicroStrategy’s stock continued to fall.In one of his many sailing analogies, Saylor likened his company’s performance to rowing a boat against wind blowing harder than one can row. Even worse, inflation began to pick up and the purchasing power of cash cows was falling hard against the stock market and against any assets they might buy. Thus, buying bitcoin was like turning the rowboat around and sailing with the wind.On Aug. 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 21,454 bitcoins for $250 million. While Saylor considered the purchase defensive, between Aug. 10, 2020 and the first week of 2021, the price of MSTR stock rose 263%, from $146.63 to $531.64.Those who didn’t want a stake in a company buying bitcoin were offered a way to cash out through a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200811005331/en/""$250 million cash tender offer via a modified Dutch auction, which saw around $60 million in redemptions.Since its first bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy hasn't slowed down. The company has now purchased 0.66% of the entire supply of bitcoin at an average price of about $30,000. The accumulation included purchases at $57,000, which now appears to be near the top for this cycle.Saylor acknowledged that MicroStrategy has developed a reputation for buying at local tops. If the company’s bitcoin thesis is correct, buying tops will be a part of a strategy that could prove to be very profitable in the long run, even if the company takes a short-term hit on earnings. Under the generally accepted accounting principles, a company is required to take an impairment charge on a digital asset if the asset’s market price falls below the company’s purchase price, while no gain can be realized until the asset is sold. So while the numbers are deceiving, MicroStrategy took a $147 million impairment charge during last year’s fourth quarter.More importantly, if all of its hopes pan out, MicroStrategy may maintain its purchasing power, hedging against inflation and potentially even outperforming the broader stock market. In the past week, Saylor and MicroStrategy’s chief financial officer have both assured the public that href=""https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/25/microstrategy-will-continue-bitcoin-buying-unfazed-by-market-plummeting-report/""they will continue to buy bitcoin and use it in a productive way that adds more value for shareholders.While many criticize bitcoin’s volatility and tendency to drop by 50% seemingly on a whim, Saylor appears to be unconcerned. His response to the criticism is that either you can die a slow death, facing the blows of a devaluing dollar and a soaring stock market, or you can fight. If bitcoin’s price can outpace inflation, it is a good investment as opposed to holding cash. While it may be a long shot, if bitcoin’s adoption becomes widespread in the near term, MicroStrategy will have put itself in a better position than the vast majority of public companies."

Feb 7 2022 12:36 PM ,"The crypto market extended its recovery during morning hours in Europe following a weekend bounce, with major cryptocurrencies rising over the past 24 hours.Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, advanced 3%. Some analysts said Friday's release of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data buoyed investor sentiment, which supported an increase in the price of bitcoin.“Despite U.S. jobs data on Friday being better than expected, global markets responded positively to the news, as investors admire the strength of the labor market,” Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at cryptocurrency brokerage GlobalBlock, said in an email to CoinDesk.“This positive reaction ignited a bounce for the crypto markets too. Bitcoin broke out of two similar downtrends on the RSI within the past year, which both resulted in incredible rallies, hence potentially foreshadowing a Bitcoin rally to the upside,” Sotiriou said. The relative strength index (RSI) is an indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes over a certain time period. RSI readings above 70 are considered overbought, and those below 30 indicate an asset may be oversold.The RSI level on bitcoin reached 61 during European trading hours on Monday after a jump from an ""oversold"" level of 20 in January, when the cryptocurrency traded at $35,550. Bitcoin was trading above $42,500 at the time of publication, with possible resistance at $46,000.Some traders expect bitcoin to see more interest from investors even as the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy.“It is worth noting that the Nonfarm Payrolls can force the Fed to move faster to tighten monetary policy,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “If cryptocurrencies manage to resist and continue to grow, this will be a serious trend reversal order. Just like on Friday, when investors decided to buy BTC in order to protect investments from inflation.”Elsewhere, gains in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ranged from a low of 1.6% for Terra’s LUNA to as high as 9.9% for XRP.Meme coins led market moves outside of the top 10. Shiba Inu’s SHIB tokens surged to $0.000029 during Asian trading hours from the $0.000022 level on Sunday evening, as href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/07/shiba-inus-shib-rockets-26-leads-memecoin-gains/""reported.Ripple's XRP token led gains among major cryptocurrencies with a 16% increase to over $0.77. The price surged amid positive sentiment around the court case in which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the blockchain-based payments firm sold XRP as an unregistered security to the public.In the latest proceedings last week, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ordered the href=""https://twitter.com/CryptoLawUS/status/1489288139579572230""unsealing of three documents in connection with the case.Torres also granted the payment giant's request to file a response to the motion to strike fair notice defense. That defense focuses on whether Ripple had reasonable notice from the SEC about whether XRP sales were illegal, according to law firm href=""https://www.hoganlegal.com/sec-vs-ripple-its-all-about-the-fair-notice-defense/""Hogan &amp; Hogan.Some industry attorneys href=""https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1489303826322575361""said the proceedings suggested the case could be headed for a verdict soon. XRP added $0.07 on Friday, holding the $0.66 level over the weekend before Monday’s surge to $0.78. XRP has slightly broken above resistance and could rise to $0.79 if the current trend continues."

That happens primarily in futures trading.The previous surge in bitcoin funding rates occurred early in 2021, which preceded a near-50% sell-off. This time, however, funding rates have not reached extreme levels, which suggests some traders have been on the sidelines, scarred by significant liquidations in the prior sell-off.Crypto funds saw inflows of $85 million during the seven days through Friday, according to a href=""https://coinshares.com/research/digital-asset-fund-flows"" target=""_blank""report Monday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares.

Leading the charts in the past 24 hours were payment tokens XRP and Shiba Inu’s SHIB, with advances of as much as 22%.Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, each added about 3% in the past 24 hours even as the tokens of layer 1, or base, blockchains Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) fell 2.5%, href=""https://www.coingecko.com/"" target=""_blank""data on analytics tool CoinGecko showed.Among other major cryptocurrencies in the same period, Cardano’s ADA jumped 2% while binance coins (BNB) were little changed. AVAX tokens surged 10% on the back of strong fundamental activity on Avalanche, which processed more than href=""https://twitter.com/luigidemeo/status/1490848334663516161""1 million transactions on Monday across various tools, services and products built on the network.SHIB extended Monday's surge. The token has gained 43% from Sunday’s low of $0.000022. Tokens exchanged hands at $0.000035 in early Asian trading hours after breaking a resistance level at $0.000027 earlier this week. The tokens saw a brief sell-off as traders took profits at the $0.000035 level.The jump came as Shiba Inu’s official Twitter account teased a possible partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase. “Hey coinbase send us a DM. Valentine's Day is approaching and we have a pending match,” the href=""https://twitter.com/luigidemeo/status/1490848334663516161""tweet read, causing prices to surge in early Asian trading hours.Bitcoin broke key resistance levels related to the ""volume weighted average price,"" or VWAP, a tool that calculates the average price a security has traded at throughout the day using both price and volume.“The 2022 yearly VWAP was acting as a key resistance level,” Delphi Digital analysts wrote in a note. “With Bitcoin now trading around $42,500, the VWAP was breached convincingly on Friday after several failed breakout attempts.”VWAP is used by traders to bid on or sell assets based on prices that provided the most volume to ensure better entries and lower href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp"" target=""_blank""slippage. In recent months, bitcoin tended to fall when it approached the VWAP levels, but has held above that level since Friday.“The Bitcoin chart continues to paint a bullish picture,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “With the price at $45,000 on Tuesday morning, BTC is trading above the 50-day moving average just above the mid-January pivot area.“At the same time, the RSI on the daily charts has not yet entered the overbought area, leaving room for further growth,” Kuptsikevich added.RSI, short for relative strength index, is an indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes over a certain time period. RSI readings above 70 are considered overbought, and those below 30 indicate an asset may be oversold.Not everyone is betting on a continued rise, however. Some traders noted that institutional activity, such as profit-taking, in traditional markets could cause a similar effect in the crypto market because various asset classes are correlated.“Cryptocurrencies briefly stopped responding to movements in US stock indices, which started the week with a decline,” Kuptsikevich wrote. “The purchases probably included retail investors, who were driven by the desire not to miss the beginning of the market growth (FOMO),"" referring to the ""fear of missing out.""“However, their buying potential is unlikely to be enough if stock indicators intensify their decline and large institutional investors come into play, wishing to resume profit-taking,” he said."

Feb 10 2022 11:27 AM ,"Crypto markets extended small gains on Thursday with prices of bitcoin and ether rising by 3% in the past 24 hours. Major cryptocurrencies saw little movement as XRP increased 3.3%, while Shiba Inu’s SHIB gained 6%.The moves showcased a recovery in the markets, which started last weekend, after a plunge last month. Total market capitalization crossed $2.12 trillion, adding 2.1% in the past 24 hours. Altcoins outpaced the growth of major cryptos, which led to a decrease in the bitcoin dominance index by 0.4 of a percentage point to 39.6%.Leading the gains in altcoins was FLOW, the token of gaming network Flow. The token surged 11% on Thursday after the mobile gaming app using the network was officially licensed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to develop a game based on the Winter Games in Beijing, as href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/10/flow-tokens-surge-on-beijing-2022-olympics-winter-games-license/"" target=""_blank""reported.Some analysts said bitcoin saw institutional demand as prices recovered from under $35,000 to over $45,000 in the past week.“The benchmark cryptocurrency continues to be in demand after strengthening above the 50-day moving average,” FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “This confirms the breaking of the downtrend of the previous three months.“For the third week in a row, institutional participants have been investing in crypto funds, according to CoinShares. On the intraday chart, you can see purchases at the close of the American session, which clearly demonstrate the interest of the institutionalists in this region,” Kuptsikevich noted.Moving averages (MA) are price chart indicators that use past prices to calculate and identify the trend direction of an asset. Bitcoin crossed its 50-day MA earlier this week at the $42,500 price level and has stayed above it since. Continuation of this price movement would imply strength and set bitcoin for a move toward $49,000.The RSI (relative strength index) values for bitcoin hovered at favorable levels. “The RSI indicator on the daily charts is now at 61, still far from the overbought zone, confirming that the market is still far from overheating,” Kuptsikevich said.The price chart tool calculates the magnitude of price changes, with readings above 70 being considered “overbought” and below 30 considered “oversold,” which may precede a change in trend.In financial news, the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program – which helped prop asset prices after the impact of the coronavirus – was on course to book a $4.1 billion loss, according to reports. Meanwhile in India, Shaktikanta Das, the head of the country's central bank, compared cryptocurrencies to the Dutch tulip bulb market bubble of the 17th century.“Investors in cryptocurrency should keep in mind that they are investing at their own risk. They should also keep in mind that the cryptocurrency has no underlying, not even a tulip,” Das said on Thursday. India had earlier this month proposed to levy a 30% tax on crypto transfers in the country."
Feb 10 2022 1:43 PM ,"U.S. consumer price rises accelerated to a new four-decade high of 7.5% in January, just a week after a government employment report signaled a strong jobs market and fast wage growth.The U.S. Labor Department on Thursday reported last month's increase in the href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm""consumer price index (CPI), the most widely followed gauge for tracking inflation, in a statement on its web site. The increase was the fastest since February 1982 and exceeded economists' predictions of 7.3%.The core CPI, which measures price changes excluding food and energy because they tend to be more volatile, rose to 0.6% month-over-month, the same pace as in December.Bitcoin (href=""https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/"" target=""_blank""BTC), which some crypto investors believe to be a hedge against inflation because its supply is limited, was down 1.9% in the minutes after the report was released by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Thursday. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield peaked over 2% for the first time since 2019.The biggest driver for overall inflation continued to be used-car prices, with an increase of 40.5% in January from a year ago and 1.5% higher than in December. Food prices surged 0.9% month-over-month, adding up to a 7% increase year-over-year, the highest since 1981. Energy costs advanced 0.9% in January.With inflation hitting a new high and the labor market hot, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to be even more aggressive in raising interest rates than previously forecasted. The Fed kept interest rates near zero after the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/26/fed-keeps-interest-rates-at-zero-says-hike-appropriate-soon/""meeting in January, but hinted at rate hikes starting in March.""With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” the Fed said in a statement after the meeting.The cryptocurrency market has seen a sharp drawdown after a period of all-time highs in November, but it has recovered to some extent over the last couple of weeks, which could be a result of the Fed’s hawkishness as inflation has picked up.“Inflation still has less influence on bitcoin’s price than other speculative factors,"" said Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy. ""The idea that bitcoin is an inflation hedge has really not been proven yet, it’s still somewhat theoretical.”However, the recent price movements in the crypto market have partly been caused by economic factors such as inflation and the likelihood of higher interest rates, according to Bauer.“The Fed is not going to be as aggressive as some are saying that they will. I don't think we're going to get seven or eight rate hikes. I don't think we're going to get a 50 basis point hike in March,” he said.Regarding a price prediction for bitcoin this year, he can see it go anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000, depending on the overall equity market and decisions made by the Federal Reserve.“If I had to put odds on one of the two, I'd say it's at 80/20 to the upside rather than the downside,” he said.UPDATE (Feb. 10, 2022, 14:19 UTC): Adds 10-year U.S. Treasury yield price.UPDATE (Feb. 10, 2022, 14:35 UTC): Adds more information on specific price increases."

Bitcoin is likely to be the primary monetary good and another digital asset is not likely to supersede bitcoin in this role.” How can financial experts come to these vastly different conclusions? The answer lies in a misunderstanding of what money is.This article originally appeared in href=""https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-for-advisors/""Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. href=""https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-for-advisors/""Sign up here to receive it in your inbox every Thursday.What is money? It’s one of my favorite questions to ask clients. There is no right or wrong answer, and financial advisors rarely ask this question themselves. The key to understanding href=""https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/""bitcoin is learning monetary history and gaining knowledge of digital networks. We’ll focus on deconstructing what money is for the first part of this series.Throughout history, we’ve moved from physical primitive goods, such as money like seashells and wampum, to physical metals like gold and silver to paper receipts backed by physical metals to government-issued fully fiat currencies. “The better the money is at holding its value, the more it incentivizes people to delay consumption and instead dedicate resources for production in the future, leading to capital accumulation and improvement of living standards,” economist Saifedean Ammous wrote in his book “The Bitcoin Standard.” We’ve only known a fiat system during our lifetimes, so it’s not easy to comprehend anything else. Money is what we receive for the economic output we provide to society. Instead of needing a scale to weigh out precious metals, we have a scale in that dollars are our unit of account and our measuring stick on what something costs. Money allows us to specialize and become an expert and pay for expertise from others. Money provides for trade.Money does not need to increase in quantity to be effective; it needs to have five critical traits – divisibility, scarcity, portability, recognizability and durability. Gold was money for thousands of years, and an ounce of gold in Roman times bought a tailored tunic, in the 1970s a fitted suit and today a broad array of fine custom suits. Gold, while having scarcity, durability and recognizability, fails miserably at being divisible and portable. Gold receipts and fiat currency solved this issue and allowed global trade to expand.Fiat currency is outstanding at solving for divisibility, portability and recognizability. The problems lie in scarcity and durability, again missing the mark at being optimal money. Bitcoin hashref=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/why-bitcoin-has-value-and-should-be-part-of-your-clients-portfolio/"" all five properties of money, but, like any money in existence, the demand needs to be there. In a previous article for this newsletter on href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/13/what-advisors-should-know-about-bitcoin-and-inflation/""bitcoin and inflation, I shared data highlighting the growth of demand for bitcoin. NYDIG recently shared that href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nydig-research-weekly-bitcoin-surpasses-amex-annual-transaction-/""Bitcoin processed $3.0 trillion worth of payments in 2021, exceeding the transaction volume of American Express ($1.28 trillion) and Discover ($504 billion).The href=""https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-part-3-of-4-2e2c002593f1""stages of monetization for any object over history has followed a similar cycle: the object being collectible, a storage of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Until fiat currency, part of what gave something value was the difficulty in obtaining it or the time to create it.Bitcoin solves this value proposition by its href=""https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-bitcoin-mining-works-2/""mining process, called href=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/16/understanding-proof-of-work-proof-of-stake-and-tokens/""proof-of-work, and the difficulty adjustment, which allows the mining network to adjust up or down the computing power needed to solve for the next block. The difficulty adjustment goal is to help ensure the supply schedule remains very predictable, which is a new block every 10 minutes. It’s an effective, yet simple, solution to a very complicated computer science problem for distributed consensus networks.href=""https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-bitcoin-mining-works-2/"" target=""_blank""Bitcoin mining is costly and time-consuming, yet the verification of the transactions by nodes on the network located around the globe is effortless and almost free. Bitcoin’s most significant benefit is having a final settlement in a digital world in record time, leveraging the mainchain or href=""https://www.coindesk.com/reports/an-in-depth-look-into-the-lightning-network-as-a-bitcoin-scaling-solution/""the Lighting network, depending on the needs of the parties involved. (When measuring speed, you must include “final” settlement – for example, credit card transactions href=""https://wallethub.com/edu/cc/credit-card-transaction/25511"" target=""_blank""are not finalized before 24 hours.)Money is what allows individuals and businesses to function and thrive. Money that has all five key traits – divisibility, scarcity, portability, recognizability and durability – helps to enhance trade and economies, as all actors use the same unit of measure. Imagine for a minute we are playing Monopoly, and I am the banker – and in each round, instead of abiding by the rules established at the beginning of the game, I institute a new tweak or change. How do you strategize for your turn? How do you plan for the roll after this one?Money is no different, as individuals and businesses make these decisions subconsciously. And when we all use the same ruler to measure goods and services, that unlocks a more productive society and economy. In my view, href=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/why-bitcoin-has-value-and-should-be-part-of-your-clients-portfolio/""bitcoin as money makes that a possibility – it href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/04/compounding-and-saving-in-bitcoin-the-power-of-a-dollar-cost-averaging-strategy/""allows for savings, not credit, to be what families run on, quick and inexpensive payments, and an incentive structure to reward value creation.

La capitalización total del mercado cruzó los $2.12 billones, hecho que significó una suba de 2,1% en las últimas 24 horas. Las criptomonedas alternativas (altcoins, en inglés) superaron el crecimiento de las principales criptomonedas, lo que hizo que el índice de dominio de bitcoin disminuyera un 0,4% y llegara hasta 39,6%.Read this article in href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/10/crypto-markets-remain-flat-as-bitcoin-sees-institutional-buying/""English.A la cabeza de las ganancias en altcoins estuvo FLOW, el token de la red de juegos Flow. El token subió 11% el jueves después de que la aplicación de juegos para móviles que utiliza la red recibiera la licencia oficial del Comité Olímpico Internacional para desarrollar un juego basado en los Juegos de Invierno que se están celebrando en Pekín, href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/10/flow-tokens-surge-on-beijing-2022-olympics-winter-games-license/"" target=""_blank""según se informó.Algunos analistas afirmaron que bitcoin experimentó una demanda institucional cuando los precios se recuperaron de menos de $35.000 a más de $45.000 en la última semana.""La criptomoneda de referencia sigue teniendo demanda tras fortalecerse por encima de la media móvil de 50 días"", dijo el analista de FxPro Alex Kuptsikevich en un correo electrónico a CoinDesk. ""Esto confirma la ruptura de la tendencia bajista de los tres meses anteriores"".""Por tercera semana consecutiva, los participantes institucionales han invertido en fondos cripto, según CoinShare. En el gráfico intradiario se pueden ver las compras al cierre de la sesión americana, que demuestran claramente el interés de los institucionales en esta región"", señaló Kuptsikevich.Las medias móviles (MA, por sus siglas en inglés) son indicadores del gráfico de precios que utilizan valores pasados para calcular e identificar la dirección de la tendencia de un activo. Bitcoin superó su MA de 50 días a principios de esta semana en el nivel de precios de $42.500 y se mantuvo por encima desde entonces. La continuación de este movimiento de precios implicaría fortaleza y prepararía a bitcoin para un movimiento hacia el nivel de $49.000.Los valores del Índice de Fuerza Relativa (RSI, por sus siglas en inglés) para bitcoin estuvieron en niveles favorables. ""El indicador RSI en los gráficos diarios está ahora en 61, todavía lejos de la zona de sobrecompra, lo que confirma que el mercado está todavía lejos de sobrecalentarse"", dijo Kuptsikevich.La herramienta de gráficos de precios calcula la magnitud de los cambios de precios, y las lecturas por encima de 70 se consideran ""sobrecompradas"" y por debajo de 30 ""sobrevendidas"", lo que puede preceder a un cambio de tendencia.Más allá de cripto, el programa de flexibilización cuantitativa del Banco de Inglaterra —el cual ayudó a apuntalar los precios de los activos tras el impacto del coronavirus— iba a registrar una pérdida de $4.100 millones, según informes. Mientras tanto, el director del Banco Central de India, Shaktikanta Das, comparó a las criptomonedas con la href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp"" target=""_blank""burbuja del mercado holandés de bulbos de tulipán del siglo XVII.""Los inversores en criptomonedas deben tener en cuenta que invierten bajo su propio riesgo. También deben tener en cuenta que la criptomoneda no tiene ningún subyacente, ni siquiera un tulipán"", dijo Das, el jueves.

Feb 11 2022 11:14 AM ,"Bitcoin recovered some of its recent price drop, passing through $43,500, after Thursday's report of higher-than-estimated U.S. inflation sparked declines in bonds, equities and the crypto market. Major cryptocurrencies nevertheless remained lower Friday over 24 hours, with bitcoin down 2.8% and ether 4.5% at the time of publication.U.S. inflation hit 7.5% in January, a 40-year high, with prices for goods and costs for services expected to pick up. Traders from Goldman Sachs forecast href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/goldman-sachs-ups-fed-hike-forecast-to-7-rate-increases-in-2022/articleshow/89498845.cms""up to seven rate hikes this year. Rate increases are an attempt to rein in inflation, a direct result of the asset-buying program put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve following the onset of the coronavirus in early 2020.“Cryptocurrencies were under the pressure of strong data on inflation in the United States on Thursday, which has updated 40-year highs,” FxPro analysts told CoinDesk in an email. “Such values can force the Fed to raise interest rates faster, which is negative for all risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.”Still, the Fear and Greed index – which calculates market sentiment – remained neutral even as crypto markets followed equities lower. “The stock markets are having an increased impact on the dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum, in which the prospects for monetary policy are being reassessed,” the FxPro analysts said.Bitcoin regained the $43,500 level after a brief dip to as low as $42,900 in early Asian trading hours, data from tracking tool CoinGecko showed. The asset continues to face resistance at $45,500.Meanwhile, crypto funds such as Singapore’s QCP Capital remain bullish on the crypto market for February. “Crypto prices rallied even though NASDAQ traded lower towards the end of last week,” the firm said in a Telegram broadcast. “We don't think this means that crypto has necessarily decoupled from NASDAQ but this tells us there is tangible and targeted crypto demand right now.”QCP said it's bullish for February, saying that market expectations and reactions around Fed hikes should subside and pointing to “positive seasonality” – stocks typically gain in February."

Momentum signals are also improving on the weekly chart, which is constructive so long as support above $30,000-$40,000 holds.On the monthly chart, however, momentum signals remain negative, suggesting limited upside for BTC around $46,000-$50,000.Australia Housing Industry Association new home sales (Jan.

Feb 16 2022 11:11 AM ,"The crypto market's rally stalled on Wednesday after crypto company ads running during the Super Bowl championship football game in the U.S. spurred gains earlier in the week. Avalanche’s AVAX led gains among the biggest tokens, adding 12% in the past day.The market has cooled since early Tuesday, when AVAX jumped as much as 13.5%, followed by Solana’s SOL token with 11% gains. That move added nearly 6% to the total crypto market capitalization, taking it above $2 trillion. Now it has hit resistance levels, with most of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market value little changed.In the past 24 hours, ether (ETH) advanced 3%, Cardano’s ADA rose 2.1% and SOL, XRP and Binance Smart Chain’s BNB added 1.5%. The moves followed rallies in broader Asian markets amid tensions between Russia and Ukraine. South Korea’s Kospi index rose 1.99%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index 1.49% while the Euro Stoxx 50 index was little changed.AVAX's touched $94 in early Asian hours. However, it faces resistance at the $95 level – which it failed to break in January – with relative strength index (RSI) readings suggesting a correction could soon occur. RSI is a price-chart indicator that calculates the magnitude of price changes and helps traders identify a change in trend.Bitcoin surged past $44,000 on Tuesday night and held above that level in the European morning. However, the move occurred during low volume, indicating weak buying strength and the asset faces resistance at the $44,300 to $45,500 levels.Outside of the majors, metaverse tokens continued to surge on Wednesday. In the past 24 hours, Decentraland’s MANA was up 10.5%, The Sandbox’s SAND 6% and Axie Infinity’s AXS 11%. The tokens are used for blockchain-based games in separate virtual worlds broadly referred to as a “metaverse.”Gala Games’ GALA metaverse token gained 2.8% in the past 24 hours after a 20% run on Tuesday. That move came after Gala Games said it would deploy $5 billion within the next year to bolster its in-game offerings by buying intellectual property rights and building a theme park, as href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/15/gala-jumps-20-leads-metaverse-index-gains/""reported.Traders said the general outlook for cryptos remained bullish amid improving sentiment for asset classes globally.""After a strong rebound following January's 7.5% CPI print, cryptocurrencies have pulled back in line with traditional markets,” said Will Hamilton, head of trading at Trovio Capital Management, in an email to CoinDesk, referring to U.S. inflation figures.""Whilst the market consolidates it is important to note a persistent decrease in the available supply of bitcoin and ether on exchanges,” Hamilton added, noting there was an increase in stablecoin supply held by exchanges that suggested investors were ready to pounce on opportunities for buying in the coming months."

Meanwhile, some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), such as AVAX, MANA and GRT, rose as much as 7% over the past 24 hours.Tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to linger, which could keep some traders on the sidelines. On Wednesday, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officials href=""https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-16-22-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank""stated that diplomacy could continue, but so far there are no signs of de-escalation on the ground.On the macro front, href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/federal-reserve-releases-minutes-from-its-january-meeting.html"" target=""_blank""minutes from the January U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed that officials are monitoring the higher-than-expected inflation that could trigger rate hikes.

Instead, decentralization is key because it makes the Bitcoin network maximally resistant to attack from anyone who might seek to change its monetary policy and thereby threaten its href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/18/not-all-cryptos-are-scarce-like-bitcoin/""inherent scarcity.No other cryptocurrency comes close to Bitcoin’s href=""https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/23/what-jack-dorseys-beef-with-web-3-is-really-about/""level of decentralization, and it seems unlikely that any ever will.So what makes bitcoin (BTC) the most decentralized digital asset?The most straightforward way to change an organization is to influence its leader. Bitcoin has no leader. Its founder, href=""https://www.coindesk.com/learn/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/""Satoshi Nakamoto, has managed to remain pseudonymous for well over a decade. And ever since Satoshi ceased communicating with the Bitcoin community, no individual or group has managed to exercise enough influence to make significant changes to Bitcoin’s monetary policy.No other digital asset can make this claim to having a long track record without influential leadership. There is no leader to coerce, no committee to bribe, and no constituency strong enough to change it.One of Bitcoin’s most important decentralizing factors is the ease with which a user can run a node. Such nodes both relay transactions through the network and also verify the entire transaction history. This allows anyone to verify the entire transaction history of Bitcoin and also make sure that future transactions comply with the rules of the protocol, including the fact that no bitcoins are double-spent and that the overall supply is strictly limited. All this can be done with href=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/15/becoming-self-sovereign-how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-node-with-lightning/""less than $300 worth of computer gear and a low-bandwidth internet connection.For digital asset networks that support higher numbers of transactions or offer greater feature functionality, higher memory and bandwidth requirements result in lower numbers of nodes that tend to be managed by corporate entities instead of individuals who are invested in the network’s success.If advances in computation continue as they have in recent years, we may soon live in a world in which people can run Bitcoin nodes on their smartphones. This could drastically increase Bitcoin’s node count, which would further decentralize the network.href=""https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-bitcoin-mining-works-2/""Bitcoin’s mining process requires expenditures on both equipment and energy. This has caused distribution of bitcoins from miners to individual holders over the years because miners have been forced to sell significant numbers of coins in order to fund their operations. This system contrasts with href=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/16/understanding-proof-of-work-proof-of-stake-and-tokens/""proof-of-stake systems, which tend to reward small groups of founders with free coins at the beginning and then allow them to maintain their stakes over time and avoid selling coins to fund the energy expenditure required for mining.While some publicly traded bitcoin miners have managed to raise capital in order to href=""https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/crypto-miners-are-stockpiling-bitcoin-amid-recent-rally-kraken-says/""accumulate bitcoins on their balance sheets, this strategy has yet to survive one of Bitcoin’s notoriously brutal “winters,” in which companies reach the end of their funding runways and have to cough up coins in exchange for fiat money. Perhaps this time will be different, but in the meantime it’s probably safe to assume that some miners will eventually have to sell off some of their bitcoins.Moreover, this distribution of coins from miners to new investors is augmented by the sale of coins by early investors. Just as with companies like href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/06/financial-advisors-bitcoin-is-the-next-amazon/""Amazon, early investors sell off their holdings over time as the value of those holdings grows, so it is with Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin has already been around for 13 years and reached a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/""total network value approaching $1 trillion suggests that bitcoins have already spread significantly. As bitcoin’s value increases, large holders will likely diversify out of bitcoin as new participants build their positions.When the U.S. Constitution was inked, it was a great idea but it had yet to be tested in the real world. Centuries later, the governance system detailed in the Constitution has so far proven robust to challenges and attacks.Bitcoin has likewise survived numerous challenges in its 13-year history, culminating in the href=""https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/29/who-sets-the-rules-of-bitcoin-as-nation-states-and-corps-roll-in/""Block Size Wars. In this struggle, a group of companies with interests in Bitcoin attempted to change the protocol to allow an increased number of transactions per second. A vocal minority of node operators and developers resisted this change, based partly on the risk that increasing the block size would increase the size of the blockchain and therefore make it more difficult to run a node. Such a change could have reduced the number of nodes in the network, thereby reducing its decentralization.The lesson drawn from this conflict was that Bitcoin would not be changed by an economically powerful group of individuals seeking to impose their will over the objections of the average users of the network. The oligarchs were forced to bow to the will of a group of vocal plebs. And, crucially, this power dynamic proved Bitcoin’s decentralization.Thanks to its design focused on implementation, lack of identifiable leadership, low barriers to running a node and proven track record of resistance to co-opting, Bitcoin reigns as the world’s most decentralized monetary network. This makes it the monetary asset with the most href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/18/not-all-cryptos-are-scarce-like-bitcoin/""credible scarcity.In my view, in a world where fiat money appears to be href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/10/us-inflation-hits-new-4-decade-high-of-75-in-january/""losing its purchasing power at a high rate, these qualities make Bitcoin the most attractive monetary asset to hold, and the href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/04/compounding-and-saving-in-bitcoin-the-power-of-a-dollar-cost-averaging-strategy/""best long-run risk-adjusted investment opportunity available."

Feb 17 2022 7:23 PM ,"Rising tensions over Ukraine don't preclude a big move higher for bitcoin (BTC), TheoTrade analyst Don Kaufman told CoinDesk TV.“If sanctions hit Russia and hit Russia heavily, there is no question that they’re going to go into every stablecoin. They’re going to go into bitcoin,"" said Kaufman, appearing on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" show on Thursday. ""This is how they’re going to circumnavigate it.”The back and forth over Ukraine continued today, with President Joe Biden saying a Russian invasion was imminent and Russia expelling Bart Gorman, the U.S. deputy chief of mission to that country. Meanwhile, Russia Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu said troops have been redeployed away from Ukraine. The news has helped send the S&amp;P 500 stock index down 1.5% and the Nasdaq lower by 2%. Bitcoin's price has crumbled nearly 7% to $41,175.Kaufman, nevertheless, said the bull case for bitcoin is supported by the rise and prominence of decentralized finance (DeFi), which could essentially stifle sanctions altogether. Whether Russia goes that route is another question because there have been mixed signals of late. Those include the href=""https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/bank-of-russia-proceeds-with-digital-ruble-renews-push-for-crypto-ban/"" target=""_blank""Bank of Russia arguing for a crypto ban in favor of its own central bank digital currency, while President Vladimir Putin's Ministry of Finance appears to be at least flirting with the idea of welcoming, regulating and taxing digital assets.Quantum Economics analyst Jason Deane agrees that bitcoin remains a viable and valuable avenue in Russia to hedge some of Biden’s threats, but sees any big moves as part of a longer-term scenario. “The theory is that uncertainty in traditional markets – all linked to a fiat system already under pressure – would drive capital tobBitcoin and make Russia look for alternatives,” he told CoinDesk. “It’s a hard call whether the asset is mature enough for that to happen.”"

Even as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken requested a meeting with his Russian counterpart, a mortar attack in the Donbas region of the Ukraine damaged multiple buildings, according to different reports.The appetite for high-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, tumbled.

Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was off similarly.

2022-02-18T09:10:09-05:00,"Despite the bitcoin price remaining far from its all-time high, social data demonstrates that retail interest in mining bitcoin is surging.Some social data suggests that bitcoin mining is more popular than ever among retail participants as a surge in interest that started early last year continues, despite a market downtrend. Bitcoin is currently trading roughly 50% lower than its latest all-time high of around $69,000, set in early November 2021. But even with bitcoin’s steady price decline over the past few months, certain online communities are buzzing with novice and seasoned miners alike discussing best practices, new products and educational resources for successful mining. Sustained activity and growth in these communities, despite a market downturn, suggests that widespread interest in mining relative to previous years is insulated from the bitcoin market’s characteristic volatility. Before discussing the data though, it’s interesting to note that one of the Bitcoin community’s favorite sentiment datasets doesn’t reflect this trend. Google search interest is a favorite tool for gauging mainstream interest in all sorts of Bitcoin- and cryptocurrency-related activities and investments. The basic reasoning behind inferring general interest from this data holds that when more people are interested in Bitcoin, search levels for certain terms and phrases will increase. And when interest and activity taper off, search rankings will also decline. But search data for several simple and common mining-related terms and phrases show low or declining interest levels. The below charts visualize this data for mining-related searches:Worldwide Google Search data suggests cryptocurrency mining interest is declining.But maybe novice miners aren’t just asking Google to answer their questions. Alternate data suggests, in the case of mining popularity, Google Search rankings are a poor gauge of general interest and industry growth. Twitter is often recognized as the leading social media platform for public cryptocurrency conversations, but for miners — especially novices looking for answers to their questions — Reddit is king. So, forget Google as a measure of mining interest because miners are flocking to Reddit forums to talk with their novice peers or learn from seasoned professionals. Reddit users have created a variety of cryptocurrency mining-focused subreddits. A few of these communities boast tens of thousands of members, and growth across nearly all of them has been parabolic for over a year. Other metrics like the volume of daily posts and comments as well as subscriber activity rankings add to the growth seen in raw subscriber counts and signal healthy community growth, not just swarms of new members boosting the size of these forums. The below charts visualize some of the data showing growth in Reddit mining communities. Bitcoin mining’s subreddit rocketed from 40,000 subscribers to more than 80,000 by the end of 2021 and continues to climb through February. Before January 2021, that same subreddit took more than three years to double its subscriber count.On Reddit, the growth of cryptocurrency mining forums is surging.Other general cryptocurrency subreddits shown above also saw near-vertical growth curves in subscriber counts. The attraction to mining alternate cryptocurrencies, especially for new, small-scale miners, can often be explained by an interest in betting on higher profitability from smaller protocols and lower financial barriers to entry with hardware and other materials. One key characteristic about this data is that the trend doesn’t lag bitcoin’s price — it’s entirely uncorrelated to it. Lots of data sets in mining lag bitcoin’s price, including prices for ASIC mining machines that characteristically climb or fall with bitcoin but with a delay. Instead of dropping with bitcoin’s price, the pace of growth in these Reddit communities has continued to surge. Retail interest in mining is a fixture of the ecosystem that seems to be unaffected by price volatility. What type of mining are these communities interested in? Activity levels are high across Bitcoin mining and alternate cryptocurrency mining forums. But for all types of miners, the desire to self-mine with complete control of the operation is strong. The types of questions being asked in the forums signal this interest: The forums are filled with users discussing basic electrical questions, hardware comparisons and more. New miners are also asking about best practices for ventilation in different climates, noise and heat insulation tricks, revenue calculations and dealing with bricked control boards. Experienced miners, mining companies and other novice miners are all offering advice, educational resources and tips and tricks for successful mining. While some miners prefer to use hands-off hosted services like Wattum Management, Compass Mining, Blockware Solutions and others, the small-scale, self-mining operation is the main attraction for members of these mining communities. All the mining fun isn’t only on Reddit though. Twitter conversations about mining news, products and educational resources have also grown considerably. Quantifying this growth is difficult though, since Twitter conversation and interaction data isn’t available as easily as Reddit data. But the growing crowds of miners on Twitter regularly post photos and videos of their setups, sharing advice on how they optimized their mining operations. A pair of active, pseudonymous Twitter users that use the nyms Diverter and Econoalchemist have also created powerful libraries of educational articles, threads and interviews targeting retail audiences that want to mine their own bitcoin. There is no uniform or comprehensive instruction manual for how to mine at home, but dozens of other miners have followed the lead of these two creators, publishing their own educational content to help other would-be miners. Shared across Reddit, Twitter, YouTube and other platforms, this growing canon of content has played no small part in creating an army of retail miners. What prompted a rush from retail into bitcoin mining is an open question with many possible answers. For one thing, mining profitability soared throughout 2021 as Chinese miners were forced offline, causing a massive shuffle in hash rate between mining pools and leaving money on the table for new miners, both retail and institutional. For another, retail mining’s growth may be a reaction to the ongoing rapid industrialization and institutionalization of mining. In 2021, institutional mining certainly came to the fore of the Bitcoin market with a surge of mining companies going public (e.g., Rhodium, Core Scientific, Greenidge), a bevy of new financial products and services created for large-scale miners from companies like Galaxy Digital and NYDIG, and even a mining council being created to form a unified voice for corporate mining companies that might be targeted by regulators and lawmakers. Possibly out of a refusal to forever accept mining as something for the “suits,” small-scale miners crowded internet forums and fueled a red-hot mining market for themselves. But whatever caused the mining craze, the online communities growing around it aren’t shrinking at all. Just the opposite, even as bitcoin sits well below last year’s all-time high, online mining communities are thriving, with growth and activity as strong as ever.This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

This article will set out propositions that will debunk those claims and explain the importance of sound money and why ignoring bitcoin and the failure to grasp the significance of its impact will be to the individual’s detriment.The very first thing to understand is that it is not your fault that you do not understand bitcoin or the inner workings and complexities of the financial system. We were not taught about this in school and it requires many hours of protracted effort in your spare time in order to begin to understand how markets work and how money works.It is my belief that the milkman, policeman, teacher and doctor along with all of the other essential professions that comprise our society should not need to have a “portfolio.” They should not need to stress and fret about which bonds or stocks to buy.In truth they should be able to place trust in their institutions and have a simple method of saving their money free from risk and theft, free from anxiety about where to keep their money. I have great empathy for people who struggle to understand why they can never seem to get ahead and great respect for those trying to find the answers.The financial industry is mostly smoke and mirrors; it is full of jargon which people use in order to make themselves sound smarter than they actually are and to provide the illusion that only they can do their job.The struggle to keep up with increasing expenses and mounting payments is a recurring theme among many people today. You seem to work harder and longer hours, but your money never seems to go far enough, with many falling into crippling debt just to stay afloat. Sometimes, this can be ascribed to bad money management and that should not be ignored. However there is an element to money which many people do not see and fail to comprehend. This is the phenomenon known as inflation.Inflation, as we experience it, is the increase in the cost of goods and services, i.e., nearly everything becoming more expensive. This increase in cost, as we shall see, is a result of the money you hold decreasing in its purchasing power, which is a consequence of the debasement of the currency (reduction in value). This then naturally begs the question — why does currency get debased?In order to answer this question and understand why inflation exists we must first understand what money actually is.Money has adopted different roles throughout history, primarily being used as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Money has also taken on various forms, from seashells and glass beads to commodities and precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, etc.) to the paper money we have today.I would direct the reader to watch this excellent series by Robert Breedlove whereby he outlines the core principles of money, providing a primer on the origins of money and its pivotal role and significance in human life.But from a first principles perspective, money fundamentally is a tool for transferring value across space and time. More specifically, it is a technology that stores energy. Let’s break this down. As an individual you go to work and expend energy by building a bridge, or say, teaching a class. You expend that energy in order to provide value to your community and as a result you are compensated with money. Therefore, money is a token that represents your time, energy and value provided to the market and to society as a whole. The more value one provides, the more they are rewarded by the market by satisfying wants and desires. To receive your monetary energy, you need a token, commodity or other note to conserve and protect it — a battery to store your value. Your wealth is a product of the value you have provided, it is therefore your prerogative as an individual to keep your wealth intact and carry that value and wealth into the future without it becoming compromised and losing its worth.We will compare the three most common types of money used today and how they compare as stores of value, or batteries, for your monetary energy, assessing their effectiveness at protecting and conserving your monetary energy across time and space.For centuries human beings used metals as a form of money, particularly silver and gold. Gold ultimately became the more dominant because of the monetary metals it was the most scarce and durable. For centuries gold has been used as a store of value and served the role fairly well. However, gold has inherent weaknesses and is not a perfect money nor an optimum store of value as we shall discover.Although difficult, more gold is and can always be mined, with the process likely to become even easier as technology evolves and improves over time, allowing access to mineral-rich places. Some even speculate that it may be possible one day to mine gold from the ocean floor and even asteroids.Its mining rate then is effectively its inflation rate, because the supply is being increased thus devaluing the existing stockpiles. There is estimated to be 244,000 tons of gold that have been discovered to date with 2,500-3,000 tons mined per year, putting gold’s inflation rate at circa 1.13%.This may not seem like much but assume you have $100,000 worth of gold but each year it is losing its purchasing power by 1.13%, as if that being like the rate of its energy leakage as a battery. This means that 100 years into the future that $100,000 would be worth just $32,000 – meaning you have lost close to two-thirds of your stored value and energy. Gold also lacks portability; it is difficult to transport across distances. It is heavy and cumbersome, and you run the risk of theft if you simply walk through the street with a wheelbarrow full of gold. So that inevitably means you will require an escort of armed guards to protect your gold when transporting it from one place to another, as well as requiring a place to store your gold (such as a bank vault) leading to you having to custody your gold with a centralized institution.You now have counterparty risk because you are relying on that institution to safeguard your assets and trusting that it can remain solvent into the future, which is not always the case. Just try to think of somewhere you could have safely placed your gold anywhere in the 20th century without it being confiscated or stolen.You likely would have only been successful in three countries, namely the U.K., U.S. and Switzerland. Even in these “safe havens,” two of these aforementioned countries actually seized their citizens' gold. In 1933, the then U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt confiscated his citizens' gold with Executive Order 6102 “forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.”Similarly, in 1966 the Exchange and Control Act 1947 was amended, permitting the U.K. government to ban citizens from owning more than four gold or silver coins and blocked the private import of gold. Every other country in the 20th century at one point or another was either mired in war (and lost) or suffered from corrupt, tyrannical governments who would confiscate their citizens' wealth on a whim.The probability of an event like this occurring again is for the reader to assess; what cannot be denied however is that if you choose to place your gold in a bank vault, you assume counterparty risk, and as an individual you no longer have custody of your asset, but are now relying on favorable external conditions to safeguard your life’s work and wealth.This now brings us to the present day. In order to understand why inflation exists and why money is systematically debased we have to also understand what fiat money is. The word fiat means “by decree.” Fiat currency is money that is endorsed by a central authority or government but has no inherent value in and of itself, being just paper rectangles with someone’s face on it.Fiat currency is the most common and ubiquitous type of money used today, examples being dollars, pounds, euros, yen, etc. As mentioned above, fiat money does not have any inherent value. However, this was not always the case. Modern-day fiat currency such as dollars and pounds used to be backed by gold. Prior to 1971, before President Richard M. Nixon terminated the convertibility of U.S. dollars to gold, an individual could enter a bank and redeem their paper notes for its equivalent in gold.The reason for fiat’s initial success and popularity is that it allowed the user a better means for transporting their wealth across distances. It is wildly inefficient to have to carry gold around in order to transact with another party. Paper currency offers liquidity, portability and ease of use. In spite of this however, you still require a place to store your cash with many opting for banks as their favored choice, which again forces you to take on counterparty risk by storing your wealth with a centralized institution.This system would be highly effective but suffers from one major flaw. Its Achilles heel? Human beings.As mentioned above, fiat currency occurs when you can no longer redeem your paper money for gold, and you are left to trade and transact with those paper rectangles. Because of human failings however, this “legal tender” legislation opens the door to mandates which end up manipulating the currency’s value, inflating the supply and as a result debasing the purchasing power of its users’ so-called “money.”We now understand that inflation is a product of fiat currency. A useful metaphor for inflation would be to picture a barrel — you fill this barrel with water every month, storing it as insurance against droughts and future uncertainty.However, unbeknownst to you, I have drilled a small hole in the side of the barrel. At first due to the barrel’s size, you don’t notice the water level having diminished. But if one were to leave the barrel for a few years and make no further contributions, upon your return you would see that the water level had decreased dramatically. Depending on the length of time you left the barrel unattended, you may return to see almost all of the water having leaked from the vessel.Inflation is entirely avoidable, as in … entirely. I believe the reason for inflation existing is due solely to quantitative easing perpetrated by governments and the central banking cartel. This simply means that central banks print more money, which further inflates the total money supply, thus systematically devaluing the currency in order to gain access to capital and appreciate assets (which they hold for the most part) whilst simultaneously stealing from the rest of society. Quite simply it is a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich.Whether central bank and government actions should be considered as malicious or benign is down to the individual to decide; the results however remain the same, no matter the intent. Inflation is larceny, whether it is perpetrated consciously or not, and it carries disastrous consequences.To put this into perspective, 40% of all U.S. dollars in existence were printed in 2020-2021.The act of inflating currencies is not something new nor a modern phenomenon. This systematic devaluation of the currency has occurred multiple times throughout history, the Weimar Republic of Germany and Ancient Rome being two pertinent examples.In 1923, the Weimar Republic suffered from catastrophic hyperinflation, reaching a point where a single loaf of bread cost 4.6 million Deutsche marks. Many would also burn their marks to heat their stoves because it was less expensive than buying firewood.The collapse of the Roman Empire was also aided by the debasement of their currency, whereby the Emperor Nero diluted the denarius into oblivion. The silver coin was initially of high purity containing approximately 4.5 grams of pure silver. However, over time the silver content was diluted from 90% silver in 64-68 AD to only 0.5% silver by 265 AD. Each coin comprised a bronze core with a thin coating of silver, with the shine quickly wearing off to reveal the poor quality underneath. As a result, Roman soldiers would no longer accept being paid in the devalued coins with the empire eventually collapsing as a consequence. To provide an example of how inflation can impact people today, let us assume that you are an astute and accomplished saver. You “save” $10,000 in your bank account (your battery). You have done well you think. However, although you have $10,000 in nominal value, the purchasing power decreases over time, harkening back to the earlier example of the leaking barrel.Now ask yourself what your interest rate is on your “savings” account at your bank and compare that to the reported inflation figures. In all likelihood you are making a net loss — you are losing energy and your battery is being drained at a rapid rate.If we do the same exercise with fiat as we did with gold, starting with $100,000 sitting in your bank account, and your interest rate being effectively zero, in 100 years that $100,000 would be worth just $205 at today’s average interest rate. This equals a total loss of 99.8% of your purchasing power based on an inflation rate of 6%. This therefore highlights the folly of storing your wealth in fiat currencyYou must understand that if you have not allocated your capital adequately and it remains in your bank account, you are mathematically guaranteed to lose money.In order to avert this, one is forced to buy assets in order to “beat” inflation and retain their purchasing power. This compels the market participant to take on the risk of investing into equities, bonds, real estate, precious metals, art and other alternative investments as stores of value. Inflation is measured via the Commercial Price Index (CPI). However, what many economists will fail to reveal is that CPI is chosen to not include specific goods and assets in order to make it seem lower:“Though it does measure the variation in price for retail goods and other items paid by consumers, the Consumer Price Index does not include things like savings and investments and can often exclude spending by foreign visitors.” (Jason Fernando, 2021).“Core inflation is the change in the costs of goods and services but does not include those from the food and energy sectors. This measure of inflation excludes these items because their prices are much more volatile.” (Will Kenton, 2020)This assumes that individuals are not concerned with growing their wealth over time and are disinterested in increasing their prosperity into the future.In order to measure the real rate of inflation, it is actually (rather comically) more reliable to measure the increase in cost of a Big Mac benchmarked against “official” CPI figures in order to gain a better picture of the situation and the real inflation rate.Inflation has many societal implications and rots a civilization from the inside out. For example, if home ownership becomes unattainable for many, then the prospects of the younger generation are severely handicapped and restricted, resulting in feelings of nihilism, desperation and hopelessness as the gap between the poor and the affluent increases. As well as money being energy, it is also a mechanism for measuring value and worth. If you were asked to measure the width of a door, for example, but the ruler kept changing, you would have no possible way of knowing the door’s true width and measurement. Can you imagine if we had the same issue with ounces, kilos, octaves, seconds, kelvins or amperes? It would be chaos.If you cannot secure your life force and you have no sight of change for the future then you have a higher probability of adopting a higher time preference, meaning you will be more inclined to spend your money in the here and now because the ability to buy a house or achieve financial independence fades by the year.With that realization, many can’t help but feel despondent, derided and resentful towards a system that has been set up to ensure their failure. Therefore, many individuals might choose to numb themselves with distractions, mindless entertainment, hedonistic pursuits and drug abuse accompanied by the general loosening of morals. The manipulation of the money supply affects the quality of our lives to a significant degree.Bitcoin is the antidote to central bank poisoning. Bitcoin rewards savers rather than punishes them. It offers a symbiotic relationship with its user, as opposed to a hostile one with fiat currency, and returns sovereignty and autonomy to the individual.It is a mistake to see bitcoin simply as an investment when it is actually a deflationary savings technology. Bitcoin is the separation of money and state — it keeps your hard-earned time and money out of the hands of perfidious politicians and larcenous central bankers.Many often describe bitcoin as “digital gold,” which while a useful analogy, does not do justice to the magnitude of change and new possibilities which bitcoin offers to the world. Instead, it is best to think of bitcoin more as a new invention, similar to the invention of railroads, the airplane, automobiles or the telephone.All of these inventions and new technologies when first introduced were met with suspicion and oftentimes hostility by the general public. Human beings do not typically like change, but over time when new technologies are adopted by more and more people our barriers are lowered as we come to understand its superior utility and the discovery of a better way of doing things.In fact, it could be argued that bitcoin is both an invention and a discovery, similar to fire. It is a discovery because it is the first time that human beings have uncovered absolute scarcity — we have never had anything which had a perfectly fixed supply.When early man first began playing with fire it might have been met with fear and trepidation by the rest of the group. Some individuals may have been burnt or scalded by the element and written it off as dangerous and a threat.But when channeled correctly, fire can be used for heat and warmth, a method of cooking food, a way to scare off predators, a means of communication, the clearing of debris and forestry and eventually leading to the invention of electricity. It is safe to say then that the discovery of fire was a net positive for humanity and contributed greatly to man getting to where he is today.Bitcoin’s main value proposition is that it is the perfect vessel for securing your wealth across time and space. With zero inflation and zero energy loss, you can retain 100% of your purchasing power 100 years into the future. This cannot be done with any other form of money or asset.Bitcoin satisfies and has perfected the properties of money.This is only possible because bitcoin has a supply cap — there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence, with close to 4 million being already lost forever. To understand this scarcity, there are 56 million millionaires in the world, which means that not every millionaire will be able to acquire a whole bitcoin.This supply cap cannot be altered, changed or increased by any party. It is completely decentralized, no one can ever inflate the supply or change the code.Because of its decentralized nature, bitcoin carries no counterparty risk. One can (and should) take full custody of their bitcoin holdings, meaning there is no need for the use of banks or centralized institutions. You do not have to rely on any third party to transact with bitcoin, as it works via its own peer-to-peer network, similar to conducting in-person cash transactions, yet accomplished over the internet with great distances separating the parties involved.In terms of bitcoin security, it is far superior to any other asset due to its encryption technology and non-reliance on third parties. Because bitcoin is digital and protected behind a wall of cryptography, nobody can access your bitcoin holdings except you because you hold the cryptographic keys.This means that you can take your wealth with you across territories and domains and have it remain 100% intact. If you are a refugee leaving your country of origin in search of a safe harbor, you cannot take your house with you. A house is immovable, and physical objects such as cash, gold or art are susceptible to theft and confiscation. With bitcoin, all of your wealth is effectively stored in your mind.The first thing to note is that you are not “too late” to bitcoin. Bitcoin is still in its monetization phase which means that there is still huge opportunity for growth.This is a common misconception amongst newcomers into the space, believing that the time has elapsed for them to acquire any meaningful position in bitcoin. But this simply isn’t true.I won’t delve too deep into the macroeconomics of bitcoin here, but one should understand that gold has a market capitalization (total value) of over $10 trillion whilst bitcoin is currently only worth less than $1 trillion. If bitcoin is to replace gold as a store of value, then it still has more than $9 trillion left to absorb in monetary energy — and that is almost a 10x from its current position.And this is only assuming that it replaces “only” gold as a store of value — the bond market has an estimated market cap of $119 trillion, which bitcoin is also a possible threat to. Moreover, many of the bonds have negative yields, which simply means that the bondholder receives less money that what they initially purchased it for.Tip! You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin.The wise approach is to focus on accumulating satoshis. Satoshis are the smaller units which comprise an entire bitcoin, similar to how pennies make up a dollar.100,000,000 satoshis equals one whole bitcoin and at the date this article was written you can purchase 1,000,000 satoshis for just $596 or £450. The goal then becomes to acquire as many satoshis as you possibly can while their value is still increasing dramatically over time. Having some level of exposure to the asset by allocating a small portion of your net worth for the asymmetric upside would be a tactically intelligent move to make.This article has aimed to provide the reader with a broad overview of the importance of bitcoin and sound money. I would direct the reader to continue reading and finding resources to find out more about the history of money and its impacts on human civilization.This is a guest post by Beren Sutton.

2022-02-17T19:30:00-05:00,"With state legislators attempting to recognize bitcoin as legal tender in the U.S., we’ve entered a new, uncharted phase of adoption.Is it actually possible for individual U.S. states to establish bitcoin as legal tender currency?Arizona State Senator Wndry Rogers seems to think so, based on the submission (SB 1341) she crafted and introduced late last month, aiming to establish bitcoin as legal tender in the State of Arizona. Meanwhile Texas Governor Candidate Don Huffines has promised to recognize bitcoin as legal tender if elected.But while there is growing interest in state leaders adoption bitcoin in this way, there might be some obstacles. Namely, the first clause in article one in section 10 of the U.S. Constitution:“No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.”As of right now, it seems that individual states do not have the capability, nor the power, to establish a newly acceptable form of legal tender within the Union of the U.S. So, that’s a bit of a buzzkill. But it’s clear that we are making significant progress in the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, sparking interest by American politicians and legislators and spreading like wildfire.“The key piece here is not whether it will pass or what impact it will have in Arizona,” explained Dennis Porter, a podcaster focused on the intersection of Bitcoin and politics. “The true impact of this bill is the fire that it has ignited. Other states and legislators are now looking at this as a potential option for their state as a way to protect themselves from a runaway federal government.”It also means that Bitcoiners as individuals need to become careful, and much more critical of what our politicians claim and promise. The game theory that we have been discussing within our circles for years is playing out, almost precisely as was expected: politicians and other public figures are realizing the power behind garnering support from the Bitcoin community. Not just because of the excitement around price action, but also due to the sheer numbers of the voter base within the borders of the United States. This voter base reaches across all party lines, anyone is capable of garnering support, from all angles.“States need to begin adopting Bitcoin today so they can begin the process of protecting themselves from the federal government unplugging them from the overly-powerful national financial system,” Porter said. “It’s a win-win plan for any state to adopt Bitcoin. It gives them more autonomy over their future.”Another recent development at the intersection of Bitcoin and politics can be found in a bill introduced to the U.S. Congress by Representatives Suzan DelBene of Washington and David Schweikert of Arizona on February 3, 2022. This particular bill is aimed at introducing a “workable structure for taxing purchases made with virtual currency,” such as bitcoin. One of the greatest hindrances to bitcoin adoption by the general public is its infeasibility as a currency for routine purchases, as it is more closely treated as a stock or other long-term investment from a tax perspective in the U.S. DelBene and Schweikert aimed to alleviate this bottleneck by providing an exemption from taxes in the use of bitcoin as a currency where capital gains amounted to less than $200.“It’s a great way to normalize the whole ‘track your buys under $600 thing,’” said Ant, the pseudonymous author of Bitcoin blockchain data dashboard Timechain Stats. “Accounting is a nightmare, and hardly anyone knows their cost basis.”However, as national politicians attempt to normalize and increasingly regulate the use of bitcoin, even if that regulation is meant to increase adoption, they will inevitably challenge the project’s status as something parallel to and outside of the national system.“Most important: Bills like this will end up doxxing a lot of bitcoiners, both directly and indirectly,” Ant warned.While a bill like DelBene and Schweikert’s may be viewed as a boon to some individuals who take portions of their salary in bitcoin, it also provides a stepping stone for potential abuse of financial surveillance powers, not just immediately, but into the future as well. Which is a very important worry amongst many in the Bitcoin space.Bitcoiners should be cautious around how quickly we are seeing these social and powerful figures flock to this revolutionary asset. It would behoove all of us to take pause, catch our breath and reflect before two potential scenarios play out:One, we rush to regulate an asset that is wildly misunderstood and provide roadblocks to those we aim to protect. And two, we rush to support and uplift politicians who hoist the Bitcoin standard in the desire to reach regulation of the asset before the regulatory windfalls are well gauged or we have established understanding, so as to avoid inviting weakness within the system itself.Our world moves fast, but we don’t have to break things. When it comes to state adoption, being a slow mover can be a blessing, not a curse.This is a guest post by Mike Hobart.

2022-02-17T19:00:00-05:00,"While some welcome proposed regulation in Russia, further examination unveils a panopticon framework that challenges the fundamentals of Bitcoin.Russian authorities recently announced that they aim to ban bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies), only to later backtrack with the message that the industry is going to be strictly regulated instead. Curiously, some prominent Bitcoiners have cheered this development, namely the provision of making bitcoin a recognised currency under Russian law. But as I’ll explain in this piece, there is nothing to cheer for in the proposed regulatory framework.There has been some back-and-forth between the Central Bank of Russia, Ministry of Finance, and presidential office, the result of which is the latest joint proposal for upcoming regulation (document in Russian language). The other document that the following text is based on is this Tass.ru article citing official sources (the Russian Central Bank and Ministry of Finance).Remarks from Russian authorities over the past few weeks speak volumes on how the government views the Bitcoin space. These are the main talking points when the authorities address the topic:… along with the usual suspects of money laundering and environmental impact. But the main point of concern seems to be that Russians are discovering a way to opt out of the fiat monetary system, which authorities do not wish to allow. The authors of the latest regulatory proposal understand that it’s impossible to ban bitcoin and attempts to do so would only lead to a strong informal market where surveillance, control and taxation would be impossible. That’s why Russian authorities seem to agree that imposing a strict regulatory framework instead of an outright ban is the right approach. So what is the proposed regulatory framework? It seems the Russian government took notes from the most strict western regulation and added a post-soviet cherry on top:The proposed regulation aims to “legalize” the use of bitcoin, but only in a very strict manner, fully consistent with KYC regulations. The idea is that only transactions done through licensed authorities will be legal, meaning that Russians would have to send and receive their bitcoin through banks and exchanges. “Transactions can be carried out by both individuals and legal entities. To do this, they will have to go through a simplified or full identification and open an electronic wallet at the bank. At the same time, individual clients will be divided into qualified and non-qualified investors, by analogy with the already existing division in the stock market. There, ""non-qualifieds"" have to pass tests to work with complex tools, and their operations are limited.” Source: tass.ru article citing official sourcesThe “regulatory clarity” of this kind is actually worse than the current “gray area” situation, as the only way to legally interact with bitcoin would be through permissioned gatekeepers. The aim is to strip Bitcoin of its main qualities of privacy, self-custody and probably even the store of value aspect, as authorities would be able to tax or confiscate anyone’s holdings at will. A true panopticon.As I’ve written before, the State’s winning move is to leech off of bitcoin through enforcing a strict regulatory framework.The motive to recognize bitcoin as a “currency analogue” and subject it to regulatory oversight is quite prosaic: the aim is to bring under strict control that which cannot be banned. For a long time, the problem that the Russian establishment faced was the one of independent donations to the political opposition and dissent, such as Alexei Navalny. This opposition, already stripped of any bank accounts, leveraged bitcoin in the past few years, with limited options for the State authorities to prevent it. Now, with the proposed regulation in place, the donors and the recipients would conveniently be found to violate new laws and could be further prosecuted. The proposed regulation is for the benefit of the authoritarian State; not of the citizens.The State is not our ally:“The competition of social power with State power is always disadvantaged, since the State can arrange the terms of competition to suit itself, even to the point of outlawing any exercise of social power whatever in the premises; in other words, giving itself a monopoly.” — Albert J.Nock, “Our Enemy, The State”Bitcoin is a subversive technology: the State may attempt to leverage it, e.g., to overcome sanctions and the threat of being cut off from the international payment systems such as SWIFT. But in the long run, Bitcoin undermines the State's power as it eliminates the ability to print and control money, and perhaps even to tax any economic activity as all personal accounts can become private. This is why in the long run, the State is never a Bitcoiner’s ally.It’s tempting to get excited about a geopolitical power recognizing bitcoin and seemingly aiding in its adoption. But it’s important to realize that state bureaucrats and politicians won’t do the hard work for us. If we want to see Bitcoin succeed as the tool of empowerment in the hands of sovereign individuals, we need to build open-source tools and promote their use, whether the State sanctions it or not.This is a guest post by Josef Tětek.

2022-02-17T17:41:28-05:00,"The country’s parliament backed in final reading an updated bill to legalize bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin is now legal in Ukraine as its parliament approved in final reading a bill that caters to the president’s recommendations. However, the country has not made bitcoin a legal tender.“The new law is an additional opportunity for business development in our country. Foreign and Ukrainian crypto companies will be able to operate legally, and Ukrainians will have convenient and secure access to the global market for virtual assets,” Mykhaylo Fedorov, Ukrainian minister of digital transformation, said in a statement.The parliament passed the new Law of Ukraine on Virtual Assets on Thursday with more than 270 votes, according to an official statement. The bill details requirements that Bitcoin service providers such as exchanges should abide by and determines fines for violations of the law’s provisions, in addition to determining that the country’s National Securities Commission regulate the cryptocurrency market.Ukraine’s Securities Commission will be tasked with issuing permits to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency service providers and carrying out supervision and financial monitoring of the market, the statement said.Ukraine had introduced a similar cryptocurrency bill in September, but President Volodymyr Zelensky vetoed it in the following month arguing that the country couldn’t afford to create a new regulatory body specifically for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.President Zelensky then returned the bill to the Ukrainian parliament along with his suggestion to let existing regulators oversee the burgeoning sector. Now, parliament has incorporated his recommendations and passed the amended bill.“The Law on Virtual Assets is largely a framework law and requires further substantial refinements, for instance, changes to the tax code,” Serhiy Tron, founder of White Rock Management and the Parea Foundation international fund, told Bitcoin Magazine. “Nevertheless, the document became an important signal to the global community since the National Bank of Ukraine officially stated that digital currency is a ‘monetary surrogate, which has no real value.’”Tron said that Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation plans to make the country a leader in the global Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market, which the new law facilitates.“By creating a high-tech, innovative cryptocurrency market that plays by clear rules, the country expects the speedy arrival of crypto investors from all over the world,” he added.Ukraine’s Bitcoin bill enables the peer-to-peer currency to emerge out of a “gray” zone with the establishment of clear-cut legislation that encompasses how the asset should be treated legally and how institutions should behave when it comes to investor protection and assurances.Tron said that now bitcoin exchanges will be able to work under clear rules and citizens’ assets will be better protected against fraud or misuse by service providers, including custodians.“Adopting the Law on Virtual Assets clearly signals to the global community that cryptocurrency is legalized in Ukraine,” Tron told Bitcoin Magazine. “The opportunity to legally develop business in Ukraine will attract crypto-investors from all over the globe to our country.”Huge shoutout to Artem Afian — Attorney and Managing Partner at Juscutum Attorneys Association for sending this English translation of the bill over to Bitcoin Magazine!"
2022-02-17T14:34:53-05:00,"Titan’s fresh capital will enable the firm to broaden its bitcoin mining pool’s reach as it taps Digital Finance Group’s network.Titan Mining, a next-generation bitcoin mining pool utilizing software to bridge efficiency with transparency, has raised $250,000 in a private investment and strategic initiative from global cryptocurrency investment firm Digital Finance Group (DFG), according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.“The support of Digital Finance Group is extremely important to us, it gives us a network and deep institutional know-how that will help us build our business, benefiting not only us but the entire industry,” Titan Mining CEO Ryan Condron said in the release.Access to DFG’s portfolio of companies is a boon to Titan Mining as it allows for a growing customer base and a larger potential for growth in developing pipelines in the industry. On the other hand, Titan’s technical and industry know-how will enable DFG to broaden its reach as it communicates with investors interested in bitcoin mining.“DFG focuses on working with the most important teams and service providers,” James Wo, founder and CEO of DFG, said in the release. “Titan Mining makes for the perfect partner to work with, being a company providing such a basic yet important service to an industry that is highly dependent on crypto mining.”Titan Mining’s enterprise-grade mining pool, the first of its kind, allows Bitcoin miners to increase efficiency and scalability at a flat low cost, while its Lumerin Protocol, which supports a hashpower marketplace driven by smart contract functionality, allows DFG to use its extended portfolio of partnerships to broaden both its technical knowledge of the industry and customer base.Titan announced the creation of its North American bitcoin mining pool, Titan Pool, in December 2020 as it sought to help increase the region’s share of the total Bitcoin hashrate. Despite once having China as a core player in the industry, bitcoin mining has over the past year decentralized to more countries following the outright ban the Asian country issued on the activity."
2022-02-17T13:27:13-05:00,"The bureau’s new ‘virtual asset exploitation’ unit will focus on blockchain analysis, cryptocurrency seizures, and staff training.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) appointed a seasoned computer crimes prosecutor as the first director of its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) and announced that the FBI is launching a new unit dedicated to providing analysis and training in cryptocurrency matters across the bureau.Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a virtual address to the Munich Cyber Security Conference Thursday that the FBI’s Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit will bring together investigators with expertise in blockchain analysis and virtual asset seizure, reported Business Insider.The bureau’s new unit will also collaborate with DOJ’s NCET, the department said in a statement Thursday.“The NCET will identify, investigate, support and pursue the department’s cases involving the criminal use of digital assets, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, infrastructure providers, and other entities that are enabling the misuse of cryptocurrency and related technologies to commit or facilitate criminal activity,” per the statement.The statement also detailed the appointment of NCET’s first director, Eun Young Choi – a seasoned prosecutor with almost a decade of experience in the department that most recently served as senior counsel to Monaco. She served as lead prosecutor in the investigation of the J.P. Morgan Chase hack and the operation of Coin.mx.“With the rapid innovation of digital assets and distributed ledger technologies, we have seen a rise in their illicit use by criminals who exploit them to fuel cyberattacks and ransomware and extortion schemes; traffic in narcotics, hacking tools and illicit contraband online; commit thefts and scams; and launder the proceeds of their crimes,” Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. said in a statement.Director Choi’s appointment and the creation of the FBI’s new virtual asset exploitation unit come on the heels of the DOJ’s largest financial seizure ever. Earlier this month, the department said it had recovered billions of dollars worth of bitcoin allegedly stolen in a 2016 hack of Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange affiliated with the world’s biggest stablecoin, Tether.Despite the mainstream belief that bitcoin’s usage in criminal activity is elevated, the phenomenon has been accounting for an ever-smaller share of total cryptocurrency activity, recently reaching 0.15% of total transaction volume, according to a Chainalysis report."
2022-02-17T12:35:43-05:00,"Watch This Episode On YouTubeListen To This Episode:In this episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s “Fed Watch,” CK and I caught up on the Freedom Convoy donation situation, dissected Jon Stewart’s wake up call with former Fed President James Hoenig, the Fed signaling around CPI and the emergency FOMC meeting and, lastly, the scandal that is brewing around Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination being delayed. This is a longer episode where we just let the conversation go where it wants to.“Fed Watch” is a podcast for people interested in central bank current events. Bitcoin will consume central banks one day, understanding and documenting how that is happening is what we are about here at “Fed Watch.”The donation drama around GoFundMe and GiveSendGo has now spilled over to the Bitcoin fundraiser on Tallycoin. As a quick update, GiveSendGo refused to comply with the Canadian court order to freeze the Freedom Convoy funds, however, when it distributed some of the funds to Canadian bank accounts, the funds to the peaceful protestors were frozen on the bank's side. This highlights the multiple layers of censorship that the legacy financial system has, and the need for bitcoin.The honkhonkhodl fundraiser is also running into a few hiccups due to the illegal invocation of the Emergency Act in Canada. The fundraiser had to be stopped because the public faces of the campaign could become targets of the out-of-control Gestapo government up there. Overall, the Tallycoin fundraiser was a great success and the community learned some very important lessons. The keys to the bitcoin have now been distributed and sending of the funds to the protestors has started.There was also a hack of the GiveSendGo campaign which doxxed 90,000 donors, the amounts they donated, and other personal information. It showed that roughly 45% of the funds came from Americans, not Canadians. This opened the door for dishonest rhetoric from the government calling it “foreign funding” of an insurrection, instead of just Americans and Canadians coming together for freedom. This rhetoric fits into the mold of the “Russia hoax” and is a sign of a government that has totally abandoned its duty to serve the people.On the show, we watched a clip of former Kansas City Fed President James Hoenig trying to explain money printing to Jon Stewart. It’s absolutely hilarious to watch Stewart being red pilled on the financial system in real time.I believe that Hoenig is attempting to explain it all in good faith, but made a couple of mistakes. One, he said the Fed is the only source of money printing. That is empirically false and misleading, because commercial banks are the source of money printing when they make loans. The Fed only prints reserves, an illiquid asset. Two, Hoenig said that bitcoin is faith-based like the dollar. Instead, bitcoin is not faith-based debt like the dollar, it is a real form of commodity-backed money.The part Stewart cannot wrap his head around is that if the Fed prints money, why can’t it print money to pay off all of our government debt? It’s a very important question. Hoenig tried to explain that all it can do is an asset swap (quantitative easing), where it trades an asset (the debt it is trying to get rid of) for a reserve (an illiquid replacement asset, not real money). This is confusing because Hoenig said it prints money in one breath and then says it doesn’t print money, it prints debt, in the next.The January CPI print sent shockwaves through the markets this week. Immediately, the market began pricing in an inter-meeting rate hike, and a 50 basis-point hike at the March FOMC meeting. The Fed played along, calling an emergency meeting that occured on February 14, to discuss the situation. By that time, however, the market had settled down and was no longer pricing in the inter-meeting hike.There is general agreement among FOMC members that a March rate hike is appropriate, but that is about all that they agree on. They are in the same boat as everyone else, watching the market and waiting.My latest article on Raskin was well timed. We discussed the growing scandal that Senator Lummis bravely started in the Senate Banking Committee hearing last week, and which now has led to, at least, a delay in Raskin’s appointment. From my article:“The real fireworks started at the 1:55:50 mark, when Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, a friend of Bitcoin, took the mic and absolutely grilled Raskin about Federal Reserve master account access, and her possible indecent connection to the one and only fintech company with a master account, which received that master account while Raskin was on its board in 2018.“Lummis laid out compelling circumstantial evidence that Raskin served at the Fed from 2010 to 2014, then the Treasury from 2014 to 2017. After her time in government, she joined the board of Reserve Trust in Colorado, which was denied a master account in 2017, but then was granted a master account after Raskin made a call to the St. Louis Federal Reserve on its behalf.“Again, it’s important to note that it is the only non-bank to be given that honor, even as dozens in Lummis’ home state of Wyoming have failed to make headway in the last two-and-a-half years. A year after the master account was secured, Raskin left the board, bought out for $1.5 million. Mic drop.”Raskin is a globalist pick who promises to bring a progressive political bent to the Federal Reserve. She is friends with bitcoin enemy Senator Elizabeth Warren and is the wife of highly-partisan Jamie Raskin. The delay of her appointment is a silent battle in the informal fight between the globalist progressive Davos crowd and the nationalist-oriented crowd, which Powell represents. That’s my take on things at least.This is a guest post by Ansel Linder. Opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
2022-02-16T18:23:21-05:00,"Governor Jared Polis expects his state to accept bitcoin and cryptocurrency for tax-related purposes by the summer.Colorado will soon start accepting bitcoin as payment for taxes, Governor Jared Polis said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC.“We expect to accept crypto by this summer” for all of the state’s tax-related purposes, Polis said.Polis added that Colorado plans on enabling bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments for other state-related fees in the months following the taxes roll out. Soon enough, a Colorado resident might be able to pay for their driver’s license with bitcoin.“We’re a very forward-looking, innovative state,” he said.However, Polis highlighted that the state would immediately convert the cryptocurrencies received as payment into U.S. dollars to fulfill its obligations and accommodate its current accounting standards.“All of our expenses are in dollars, our budget is approved by legislators in dollars, so when we talk about accepting crypto for payments, they would be converted back into dollars for our purposes,” Polis said.The conversion would be performed by a third-party entity, Polis detailed, which would act as an intermediary between the taxpayer and the government, facilitating the exchange of bitcoin and fiat currency as needed.Polis also said that he thinks protecting the privacy of citizens is a “key role” of the government.U.S. states have been racing to push the most welcoming legislation for bitcoin as they seek to become a hub for innovation in the space by attracting businesses and entrepreneurs to create jobs and empower the local economy.New Hampshire established a study commission for bitcoin and cryptocurrency on Monday to research ways the state could foster innovation in its economy. In Missouri, on the other hand, bitcoin could soon be exempt from state taxes altogether, while Tennessee wants to buy BTC itself. However, Arizona is taking it a step further by proposing making bitcoin a legal tender in the state."
2022-02-16T17:34:29-05:00,"Take a sneak peek at exclusive details about Coinkite’s upcoming hardware wallet.Bitcoin Magazine obtained exclusive access to details about the upcoming COLDCARD Mk4, the new version of Canada-based Coinkite’s Bitcoin hardware wallet that improves upon the popular COLDCARD Mk3.The main features of the new model include a USB-C connector, no restrictions on Bitcoin transaction size, increased security with an extra secure element, NFC integration, a slide cover, a USB virtual disk mode, and an extensive “Trick PIN” optionality.The front and back of Coinkite's upcoming hardware wallet, the COLDCARD Mk4. Photo courtesy of Coinkite.In the connections front, the user can opt into using NFC with the Mk4 by enabling it in the device’s settings as the feature will come disabled by default. Once turned on, NFC will enable the COLDCARD to come near a compatible device to sign a transaction or a message, co-sign in a multisig setup, or share information from the device’s MicroSD card like a payment address or an extended public key, a partially-signed Bitcoin transaction (PSBT), a text file, or a transaction file.Coinkite founder NVK told Bitcoin Magazine that the goal with NFC is to lower cost, improve UX, and further adoption.“Imagine hardware wallets being able to just tap-to-pay,” he said.Although QR codes have recently become popular in some hardware wallets, NVK said they haven’t been adopted in the larger payment industries because they have extremely low data bandwidth, are more complex and not human readable, and require more expensive hardware.“This feature was added to improve phone-wallet UX as all modern phones have NFC, free, already sitting unused,” NVK said. “NFC will be available to all COLDCARD functions we are able to send or receive data, just like the SD card or USB cable.”In addition to requiring NFC to be turned on for usage, NVK told Bitcoin Magazine that the Mk4 will also enable the user to permanently disable the feature by scratching a PCB trace exposed on the MicroSD opening.While previous versions of the COLDCARD had a single secure element (SE), Mk4 brings a second SE to establish a more robust security model for the user’s private keys and suppress potential single points of failure. Moreover, the fact that the second SE is from a different vendor further protects the user from any unexpected bugs or issues with a specific SE design.An attacker would need to fully compromise the two secure elements and the main microcontroller (MCU) before being able to extract seed words from the COLDCARD Mk4 as the device now distributes the encryption key among the three components. Additionally, even if all three components are compromised, the device’s PIN code would still be required.Mk4 also allows the user to set up multiple “Trick PINs.” While the actual PIN unlocks the device and enables wallet functions, Trick PIN codes can exert alternative functionality such as unlocking a duress wallet, triggering a long login delay, or bricking or blanking the COLDCARD. These PINs are useful in different scenarios, but they can often come in handy in a physical attack where the user is coerced into unlocking their COLDCARD. For instance, the user can just use a Trick PIN for unlocking a duress wallet for plausible deniability. Alternatively, in a more extreme scenario, the user can type in a Trick PIN that wipes the COLDCARD clean and then bricks it, making it unusable.Additional improvements brought by Mk4 over Mk3 include faster booting; a 120 Mhz CPU, up from 80 Mhz; maximum space for settings – now 512 KB, up from 4 KB; more multisig wallet possibilities; firmware upgrade now takes 15 seconds, down from two minutes; 216 bytes of new secure storage alongside main seed phrase; a flashing light indicating when the USB connection is in use; a USB disk emulation for simple use with web browsers and other PSBT sources; and a doubled flash memory for firmware, among other updates.Mk4’s launch date is yet to be determined, but the device is available for pre-order at the Coinkite store."
2022-02-16T17:00:00-05:00,"Putting bitcoin to use as a payment processor onboards merchants, brings together Bitcoiners and shows the true power of the network.On a snowy evening in a bar near Denver, Colorado, 10 Bitcoiners got together to change the way businesses view Bitcoin and how they can attract a “new” type of customer. This event was put together by CryptoBeerKings (CBK), Bitcoin event planner and consultant, with a goal of showing a proof of concept to new merchants in accepting bitcoin on-chain and Lightning Network (LN) transactions as another form of payment. How easy and seamless can the process be for a business to accept this new form of payment? Let’s find out!The brewery that hosted the event does not at the moment accept BTC or LN payments, nor did they know much about Bitcoin, but they were willing to allow this experiment. In order to set up this event, CBK arrived 30 minutes early to set up a BTCPay Server that would act like a merchant payment processor at the microbrewery. In doing so, a webpage on CBK’s laptop was created to act as a point-of-sale (PoS) store, and their beers on tap were listed. It was a basic webpage that any business can incorporate into their existing website if they choose to accept bitcoin as payment.A QR code was created on screen, just as so many breweries and restaurants do now, that would take customers to the PoS store, where they could make their selection. Once a selection was made, the beer was added to cart, and with the simple click of the “Pay” button, a QR Code would appear giving the thirsty Bitcoiner a choice of paying on-chain in bitcoin or via Lightning. Just like that, in a few seconds, gatherers at the event were using Strike, Breez, Muun, Zeus or Blue Wallet to make their first LN beer purchase!I even went so far as to take a photo of the setup with a beer and the QR event card. I posted it to one of a few LN groups I'm involved with, just to show how pumped I was about this event coming together. A friend was able to scan the QR code from the picture to the PoS store and bought me beer, from a timezone away! That is the power of this technology. One attendee of the event called bitcoin “five-dimensional money” and my friend proved it.My fellow Bitcoiners gave me great feedback without prompting. Some discovered a new brewery, while others got to experience transacting in bitcoin or Lightning easily and seamlessly. This wasn't the case just a couple of years ago, because the tech was still being developed for both merchants and customers. Most Bitcoiners have only heard of BTCPay Server through podcasts or reading about it, but I was able to introduce some new people to BTCPay Server, how it works, the setup, etc.This is what it was designed for — to act as a payment processor for merchants who wish to eliminate fees from middle men, bring in new customers and use 21st-century technology in their business. Too often we see bitcoin as mainly a store of value, and this event served as a bridge between a merchant unfamiliar with bitcoin and Bitcoiners who never would have appeared that cold snowy evening at this microbrewery. Overall, this new system will improve both customer and merchant experiences which will lead to continued adoption worldwide.Reflecting on the event after the adrenaline came down, I realized I’m ready for the next experiment. This project took over a year and included quite a learning curve. The hard work, community support and questions got me to this point. A successful event where everyone paid via LN that didn't feel hacky or gimmicky. Bitcoin and LN development are improving every day, and the user base is growing by the millions. In-person events will happen more often and both merchants and Bitcoiners will benefit. This will not be the last event, CryptoBeerKings will be reaching out to more breweries and with the support of the Denver Bitcoiners, we will keep adding more people to the Bitcoin lifeboat!So, on the same day the IMF pressured El Salvador to remove bitcoin as a legal tender, 10 Bitcoiners got together in a bar near Denver, on a snowy night, to raise a toast to conducting transactions in sats and to tell the IMF, “go pound sand.”This is a guest post by Anthony Feliciano.

2022-02-16T16:00:00-05:00,"By changing the way we display denominations of value in bitcoin, we can make it easier to onboard people who may not understand bitcoin’s divisibility.As the price of bitcoin will potentially increase over time, we need to adopt a new strategy to promote the relative affordability of bitcoin. In addition, we need to address and remove some legacy barriers which both confuse and intimidate people new to bitcoin. This article proposes some simple, easily executable ideas to address these issues and is intended to stimulate discussion within the existing Bitcoin community.Although this is primarily aimed at existing bitcoin holders and exchange or wallet developers, if you are new to bitcoin, you may find some of the content of value also. Even without the ideas being adopted, this article covers most of the common areas of confusion and will assist in clarifying some of the issues with the current approach and vocabulary.It should be noted that we are very early in the bitcoin adoption curve and most people have no clue what bitcoin is, how it works and its benefits. There is still plenty of time to adopt new terminology or promote underused terminology that makes bitcoin more accessible to the majority of the population.Even if people have funds available to purchase bitcoin, there are multiple aspects of bitcoin that can confuse or deter the adoption of bitcoin. The current default of enumerating the pricing of bitcoin per whole coin has a negative impact. At the time of writing, the price of a whole bitcoin is around $40,000. The common and understandable reaction to this, from the average person, is that bitcoin is expensive, unaffordable and it prevents them from acquiring bitcoin. Even worse, it sometimes forces them down the path of looking for more “affordable” cryptocurrencies.We have reached the point where most people will never be in a position to acquire a whole bitcoin, so a new approach is required to recalibrate people’s perception of bitcoin’s affordability. Primarily, this needs to be done by promoting partial bitcoin purchasing and adopting an alternative, pre-existing default denomination, rather than using the metric of a whole, single bitcoin.When purchasing or transacting in bitcoin, people are forced to think in terms of unwieldy fractions (e.g., 0.00178652 bitcoin). This fractional complexity makes it difficult to assess the numbers involved accurately and allows for errors to be easily made. In addition, the use of integers with eight decimal places can be extremely intimidating to most people.Although bitcoin is divisible — 100,000,000 satoshis, or sats, per bitcoin — most people are unaware that it’s possible to purchase partial bitcoin.Bitcoin, while divisible, does not follow the usual convention of existing fiat currencies. Large fractions of bitcoin or large numbers of sats have no similar structures in traditional fiat currencies. This lack of familiarity is off-putting to potential bitcoin holders and makes bitcoin seem entirely alien and different from any currencies they might be used to.All of these issues can be addressed without any changes to the core bitcoin architecture, but with some relatively minor tweaks to the presentation layer in exchanges and wallets.There already exists a smaller denomination within bitcoin that usefully mimics some of the principles of traditional fiat currencies. That is the microbitcoin or bit for short which uses the symbol μBTC: 1 bit equals 100 satsAt the current price of $36,000 per BTC, 1 bit is equal to $0.036.If we now price bitcoin on exchanges as USD/1,000 bits rather than USD/1 BTC, the price becomes a much more affordable $36 per 1,000 bits.Adopting USD/1,000 bits also gives a lot of scope for the price of bitcoin to rise even further without impacting perceived affordability. In addition, by using the USD/1,000 bits as a pricing metric, volatility in the price is perceived to be less:- If bitcoin (BTC) falls from $51,000 BTC to $36,000 BTC this is perceived as a huge drop.- If bitcoin (USD/1,000 bits) falls from $51 to $36 the impact of the volatility is the same but has less of a perceived impact.When the average person accesses an exchange, they will see the current whole bitcoin price and be given the option to purchase a fraction of a bitcoin. Usually, this is presented as a single integer with eight decimal places (e.g., based on a BTC price of $36,000, you can purchase 0.01000000 BTC for $360).If the pricing denomination were bits, you would purchase 10,000 bits for $360, a much simpler human scale.Working with eight decimal places with multiple leading zeros is difficult and prone to error. In some instances, the trailing zeros are omitted (e.g., 0.01 BTC) making the number even harder to process. Besides, who wants to buy 0.01000000 of anything. The number appears meaningless. This becomes even more important when sending bitcoin. Would you feel more confident sending 5,000 bits or 0.00500000 bitcoin — or is that 0.00050000 or 0.00005000, can you even see the difference easily?Ask anyone with less than a whole bitcoin how much they have, and they will usually reply with the USD (or local currency) equivalent (e.g., I have about $5,000 worth of bitcoin). This figure, of course, will fluctuate with the current price of bitcoin. The chances that they will say, “I have 0.13664418 bitcoin,” is zero. If they are really down the bitcoin rabbit hole, they might say they have “13,664,418 sats.” So, how many more sats do they need to get a whole bitcoin? Just take 13,664,418 from 100,000,000!If the bit were to become the accepted norm, they would say “136,644 bits.” There are a million bits in a bitcoin, so the calculation 1,000,000 - 136,644 is so much easier! It’s 863,356, by the way.If we want to move people away from working in USD into working with BTC, we need them to know how much bitcoin they own in an understandable form. Over time, it might well be that people will start to want to buy in bits rather than in USD monetary equivalent: “I want to buy another 10,000 bits next month to bring my total to 100,000 bits.”A common meme when discussing bitcoin volatility is the “1 BTC = 1 BTC.” The inference is that you should not focus on the current fiat equivalent, but look to the future when everything will be priced in bitcoin. So, a good first step is to start allowing people to conceptualize and remember how much bitcoin they have — 0.13664418 bitcoin or just over 130,000 bits — I know which I find easier to remember.A lower denomination of bitcoin already exists called the satoshi or sat, so why not use that? Each bitcoin is comprised of 100,000,000 sats. Many people have called for the satoshi to be the default denominator for bitcoin, but this may not be the best approach.If you’re already in the space, you’ll know that satoshis are in reference to Satoshi Nakamoto, the fabled inventor of Bitcoin. It’s a great homage to the creator, however, the word “bit” has familiarity and has a direct association with bitcoin.Bitcoin is already a relatively well-known term through the mainstream media, so people are already familiar with the word “Bitcoin.” The bit is a perfect diminutive form of the word bitcoin. It’s a “bit” of a bitcoin — there is nothing to learn to associate — it’s just a “bit” of a bitcoin.Humans find it difficult to appreciate or conceptualize the scale of large numbers.With sats, 1 BTC equaling 100,000,000 sats is a vast number to comprehend. In addition, the fiat value of a single sat (for now) is in the order of four decimal places. It’s difficult to calculate and visualize or conceptualize a single sat: 1 sat equals $0.0003672. This also means that small purchases require thousands of sats, something that is unnatural and unfamiliar to most people. For example, - A $4 coffee equals 10,897 sats: In the fiat world, when did you last buy anything for 10,897 cents or pennies?- A $4 coffee equals 108.97 bits: That’s 108 bits and 97 sats.Note that the bit example mimics traditional currency notation with whole units and two decimal places. This is a much more familiar concept for people with no experience of bitcoin.To improve the ease of usage of bitcoin, we need to follow some of the principles of traditional fiat currencies such as the dollar, the pound and the euro.This can be done without any changes to the core bitcoin principles or architecture and simply relies on a shift in the default denomination of bitcoin. Doing this also positions bitcoin as a more understandable currency to the average person.Most traditional fiat currencies are structured in the same way.The Dollar (USD)Of course, $1 dollar equals 100 cents.There are no specific names (other than slang) for multiples of the dollar (i.e., 1 dollar, 10 dollars, 100 dollars, 1000 dollars, 100,000 dollars, 1,000,000 dollars).The dollar can be written as $1 or as a dollar and cents value, such as $1.57 is 1 dollar and 57 cents.The Pound (GBP)Likewise, £1 pound equals 100 pence.There are no specific names (other than slang) for multiples of the pound (i.e., 1 pound, 10 pounds, 100 pounds, 1000 pounds, 100,000 pounds, 1,000,000 pounds).The pound can be written as £1 or as a pound and pence value, so £1.57 or 1 pound and 57 pence.It’s exactly the same for the euro with euros and eurocents.The Bit (BIT)Similar to the dollar and pound, 1 bit equals 100 sats.There does not need to be specific names (other than slang) for multiples of the bit (i.e., 1 bit, 10 bits, 100 bits, 1000 bits, 100,000 bits, 1,000,000 bits).The currency symbol for the bit will need to be agreed upon. Perhaps a lowercase bitcoin ₿ or a combination of μ₿. Let’s use μ₿ for illustrative purposes.The bit can be written as μ₿1 or as a bit and sats value as μ₿1.57 or 1 bit and 57 sats.Based on the current bitcoin price of $51,000, the multiples of bits would look like this.So, μ₿1,000,000 equals 1 BTC.However, we may not need to denominate in whole bitcoin in the future, just 1 million, 2 million, 3 million bits, etc. Just like we do with the dollar, pound and euro. When have you ever heard a USD millionaire referring to their wealth as 100,000,000 cents?As the price of bitcoin increases, the problem of the perceived affordability of the current denomination of whole bitcoin increases. The bit is well placed to cope with potential bitcoin price increases.At $1,000,000 per BTC, the bit reaches price parity with the dollar.In the rudimentary illustration below, the left panel shows a typical buy screen on an exchange. This shows BTC as a single integer with eight decimal places, along with the price of a single bitcoin. The fractional complexity of the bitcoin amount and the high cost of the whole bitcoin is off-putting and alien to most people.A mock-up of the same screen is below but displays bits with a price per 1,000 bits. Again, we are able to deal with whole numbers with just two decimal places and the price isn’t anywhere near as scary as a single bitcoin.No need for a mock-up as one wallet already has the option to enumerate in bits, that is the Blockstream Green wallet. The screenshot below is in standard BTC. This uses the standard presentation of a single integer with eight decimal places to represent the fraction of a bitcoin.The same wallet switched to enumerate in bits (on the right), shows a much more user-friendly presentation of bits and two decimal places of sats, just like a familiar, traditional fiat currency. Both display the amount of bitcoin in USD. The bits presentation is much cleaner, more familiar, easier to read and less prone to error.There is no change required to the underlying core Bitcoin technology. There are also no changes needed to any core Layer 2 technologies such as Lightning.The changes that would need to happen:- Consensus on adopting the bit as a common denominator across exchanges and wallets.- Consensus on selecting and adopting a standard currency symbol for the bit.- Changes to the presentation layers of exchanges and wallets to show 1,000 bits as the pricing indicator for bitcoin.- Changes to exchanges and wallets to transact using the bit as the standard denomination for BTC.All of these are relatively minor technical changes.The most important (and most difficult) change that needs to happen is to change the mindset of the existing Bitcoin community. We need to find a consensus to switch to using bits as the preferred domination of bitcoin.This may be difficult for existing Bitcoin users who are already familiar (and comfortable) with using sats and may think that it’s too late in the process to change.I cannot stress how early we are in the bitcoin adoption cycle, and change is possible. It just needs consensus and a real understanding of the potential benefits. Making a change now to using bits as the default denomination would make a massive difference in the perception of bitcoin to the general public, as well as smooth the way to bitcoin being adopted and used on a day-to-day basis.There is no doubt that we need to address how bitcoin can be more relatable and accessible, as well as being less error-prone, intimidating and confusing.“Stacking sats” is a great slogan but totally meaningless to a no-coiner.“Buying bits” is something people can relate to.This is a guest post by Don McAllister.

2022-02-16T12:42:42-05:00,"Super Bowl LVI featured a Bitcoiner scoring the game’s first touchdown and commercials referencing bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Bitcoin went mainstream in the latest Super Bowl, both on and off the field as a Bitcoiner caught the first touchdown pass of the game, many ads referenced the peer-to-peer currency and the game was held in a stadium sponsored by a provider of bitcoin trading services.The Los Angeles Rams wide receiver who last year decided to take his full salary in bitcoin, Odell Beckham Jr., caught a 17-yard strike from Matthew Stafford on third and three for the score – his first catch of the night that also ended up being his team’s first touchdown in its victorious Super Bowl LVI match.“This is everything I've ever dreamed of, you know,” Beckham told CBS Sports. “And there was a moment I was in the back room and they told me I was done, I couldn't play. And I had to come back out there and be a part of this because it's so much bigger than myself. And these boys pulled through and made it happen.”Canadian superstar rapper Drake placed a million-dollar series of bets on the success of Beckham Jr. and his team in advance of the Super Bowl and turned out victorious in two out of his three bets. The rapper took over $1 million in profit in bitcoin after betting that the wide receiver would lead his team to victory with at least 62.5 receiving yards and over 0.5 anytime touchdowns.Off the field, Bitcoin also marked its presence in one of the flagship U.S. sports events of the year as millions of fans watched the commercials in between plays. Super Bowl ads are commonly leveraged as a unique opportunity to introduce a topic into the mainstream as millions gather to watch the championship match of one of the most traditional sports in American culture.The premier ads, which this year cost as much as $7 million for a 30-second slot, featured four Bitcoin-related commercials from prominent cryptocurrency exchanges as many mixed different ad strategies with free BTC.Cryptocurrency exchange FTX premiered comedian Larry David missing out on a slew of past innovations in human history by making fun of the new developments while referencing back to well-established but outdated solutions. David finished by disregarding cryptocurrency and FTX itself. The exchange also gave bitcoin away after its ad to four lucky winners.Crypto.com also went with a celebrity, featuring NBA star Lebron James traveling back in time to talk with his younger self. The young James asks for tips from the future while present-day James refrained from answering, saying, “If you want to make history, you've got to call your own shots.”Social trading platform for stocks and cryptocurrencies eToro also got in on the action with an advertisement called “Flying Your Way” that featured a flock of traders recruiting newcomers.On the other hand, Coinbase opted for a more minimalist approach. The unconventional ad showcased a bouncing QR code that resembled an old DVD logo for 60 seconds and turned out to be quite successful as Coinbase’s platform saw “more traffic than ever.” However, that much buzz led to the platform crashing as those who scanned the code were promised free bitcoin. The largest U.S. exchange’s commercial was awarded as the best ad in the Super Bowl by some marketing specialists due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Notably, the ad also referenced an episode of TV show “The Office” in which the DVD logo on Michael Scott’s TV perfectly touches the corner.The arena that hosted Super Bowl LVI also has ties to Bitcoin. Financial services platform SoFi Technologies, title sponsor of the stadium in Los Angeles where the Rams played against the Cincinnati Bengals, provides cryptocurrency trading services in the U.S. and is headed by a chief executive who holds bitcoin himself.“We’re invested in cryptocurrency — we own Bitcoin,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said Monday. “If you don’t innovate, and you don’t use cryptocurrency as a technology platform, you’ll get left behind.”In between the game’s first and second halves, SoFi Stadium also hosted the infamous Super Bowl halftime show. This year, the panel of performers featured rapper superstars Eminem, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar. And 50 Cent, who was paid in bitcoin for a 2014 album, also appeared in the performance. Despite having received BTC as payment, however, the rapper instantly converted it to U.S. dollars at the time. He might have made a different choice then if he’d have known the Bitcoin Bowl was coming in 2022. "
2022-02-16T11:37:16-05:00,"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has ordered regulated financial firms to cease interacting with Bitcoin addresses allegedly connected to the Freedom Convoy.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canada’s federal and national police service, has issued an order to all FINTRAC regulated companies in the country demanding them to cease transacting with bitcoin addresses allegedly associated with the Freedom Convoy’s fundraising efforts.The order, seen by Bitcoin Magazine and first reported by The Counter Signal, details an ongoing investigation by the RCMP and the Ontario Provincial Police on bitcoin donations received by the truckers protesting in Ottawa, Canada’s political center, for the end of COVID-related mandates — a movement deemed illegal by the administration that recently prompted Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau to invoke the rare Emergency Measures Act.“Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Measures Order, under subsection 19(1) of the Emergencies Act, there is a duty to cease facilitating any transactions pertaining to the following cryptocurrency address(es),” the order stated.The document then lists 29 bitcoin addresses that have transacted up to $1 million worth of BTC.Additionally, the RCMP is interested in obtaining information about any movements to or from these addresses.“Any information about a transaction or proposed transaction in respect of these address(es), is to be disclosed immediately to the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, at CryptocurrencyNHQ-CryptomonnaieDG@rcmp-grc.gc.ca,” the federal police service asked in the document.Despite its limited impact, the order puts truckers in a difficult position. Although it doesn’t prevent peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions from occurring, it makes it harder for protesters to convert bitcoin back to Canadian dollars as regulated off-ramps fall under the RCMP’s scrutiny. Financial services providers like popular Canadian bitcoin exchanges Bull Bitcoin and Shakepay are registered with FINTRAC, meaning they might prevent deposit and withdrawals to and from the addresses listed on the police order.It is unclear whether the restrictions apply only to the addresses specified in the document or if the RCMP would attempt to track the movement of funds to subsequent Bitcoin addresses through chain analysis efforts, effectively extending the blacklisting."
2022-02-16T10:00:00-05:00,"Swan BitcoinSwan said it expects the collaborative initiative, Bitcoin Canon, to become the go-to destination for learning about Bitcoin.Swan Bitcoin has announced Bitcoin Canon, a new platform of educational Bitcoin content curated by Bitcoiners to bring high-quality information to the masses.“Over the years, we have seen the educational resources in the Bitcoin space grow in both quality and quantity,” Swan’s VP of education and marketing, Brady Swenson, said in a statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine. “The goal with the Bitcoin Canon is to collect and organize the best bitcoin content on the web in one place so it’s more easily accessible and shareable for beginners and experts alike.”Bitcoin Canon aims to become the go-to hub for Bitcoin resources by employing a collaborative approach to submitting, cataloging, and sharing core knowledge about the complex peer-to-peer (P2P) monetary system.“We hope that the Bitcoin Canon becomes the most recommendable resource to learn and share Bitcoin resources to further drive the world's understanding of this revolutionary technology,” Swenson added.The platform leverages the concept of Rabbit Holes to separate content by topic, ranging from the economics of Bitcoin to the intricacies involved in using the currency privately. Each Rabbit Hole works as a collection on Bitcoin Canon, featuring a list of resources focused on a specific topic curated by Bitcoiners.The Bitcoin Canon platform enables users to browse through different topics about Bitcoin and select the Rabbit Hole they would like to dive deep into.

2022-02-16T08:00:00-05:00,"Recent pro-Bitcoin developments from Russia could put the Eastern power in a lead position as inflation grows. How will other powers react?On February 15, the Russian Ministry of Economic Development signaled a bullish development around Bitcoin; reduced costs for bitcoin miners. But what can we make of this?First the obvious: yes it is bullish. The Russian Ministry is reportedly considering “energy tariffs” for bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) miners, as well as taxing cryptocurrency-to-ruble conversions — as long as said facilities are constructed in particular regions (you don’t want bitcoin miners just popping up anywhere, not that they operate in this manner, anyway). One of the justifications from the ministry (as noted here) has been that bitcoin mining incentivizes great increases in energy generation, while allowing for rapid pivoting of demand by the grid. This means that if energy demand were to shift quickly, say in the wake of unorthodox weather situations, then the grid has the capability to limit or shutdown miners with the intent of supplying energy demand where it is most pertinent. Secondly, this places pressure on Western powers. The U.S., the United Kingdom and the European Union have been slow to make concrete decisions on Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining facilitation. Which isn’t surprising in the least; not only does Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and decentralization threaten the feasibility of the SWIFT system, but they also make controls over capital flight much more difficult to enforce. Furthermore, there is concern around inflation sticking around, particularly as it might affect the price of energy. This is another area in which Russia may play a pivotal role, as incentivizing bitcoin miners to bring business within their jurisdictions would not only provide economic stimulation to in the form of infrastructure projects, but would also strengthen the resilience of the grid by providing an additional source of monetization that is demand-flexible. As the cost of natural gas increases, the incentives to invest in renewables decreases (due largely to their risk of intermittent production). It is for these reasons that Russia would be pressed toward seeking to mitigate energy cost inflation going forward in the form of incorporating bitcoin mining operations into energy projects. These justifications suggest that Russia is interested in incentivizing bitcoin mining within its borders, in addition to the following points:Now, we come full-circle back to recent developments out of Russia, and now, China. On February 2, Russia announced a ban on ammonium nitrate exports through April with the intent on being more capable of supporting domestic agricultural efforts. The problem? Russia is the United States’ leading source of ammonium nitrate, a very important ingredient for munitions production, adding further weight behind recent developments and activities on Russia’s Western border. Going further on the fertilizer thread was China’s banning of fertilizer exports this past summer. However, the crumbs of this Hansel and Gretel tale don’t stop there. With the aforementioned points, we get enough scope to see how inflation is significantly impacting all of us, but there is more. Consider Russia’s activity in Ukraine and how it is stoking the flames and fears of war. A normal economy is heavily reliant on energy, and war magnifies energy demand by an order of magnitude (if not more). If Russia is intent on war, the European Union will require significant amounts of energy to facilitate resistance — in this particular case, said energy would be coming in the forms of oil and natural gas. And who is the EU’s largest source of energy? It’s Russia. To make matters worse, Germany is the leader of manufacturing in the EU. And what country does Germany rely on heavily for trade in order to sustain said manufacturing? It’s China. To make matters even more complex, China is applying militaristic pressures of its own upon Taiwan, a key player in the global chip manufacturing space — upon which technology in general relies upon heavily. If war grips this area of the world, I would expect further increases in prices across the board, as technologies would increase in price due to consistent/increasing demand meeting restricted supply, if said chip manufacturing sites were to go offline.Now, for a really big question, “big” in the sense of implications on historical, geo-political and even individual levels of “big.” Where does Bitcoin fit in?In incentivizing mining operations, Russia is signaling increasing support and appreciation for the nascent asset and technology stack that accompanies Bitcoin’s network operations and incentives. Additionally, because Bitcoin operates outside of the purview of any one nation or group’s borders, the risk of sanctions is all but eliminated if trade is done via a neutral asset such as bitcoin. Furthermore, a nation that were to adopt such a neutral asset via trade (possibly even pricing energy in bitcoin) would open up its coffers to trade with quite literally anyone, inviting an influx of demand for goods and services rendered. The U.S. and its allies are now effectively backed into a series of corners. Can the U.S. attempt to ban Bitcoin and its transactions? It can try, but will fail. China has already tried to do so, multiple times, and the same goes for India. Not to mention, the U.S. now has a multitude of politicians advocating for Bitcoin adoption, like U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis and state governors showing political support for the asset and network. On top of that, there’s the massive inflows of network hash rate that came to U.S. shores after China’s infamous mining ban. And, going even further, there’s the consideration that the FDIC has been looking into providing support for American banks to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets.As the saying goes, “Bitcoin is for friends and enemies.” Are Russia and China pushing their agendas to not only get what they want, but also force U.S. and other Western powers into inflationary environments to weaken the petrodollar (U.S. dollar) hegemony? And, in doing so, will bitcoin be capable of proving to the world that it truly is an asset of the future, where allies and foes transact equally? Then, in this environment, could we also see both sides pushing for Bitcoin adoption and proliferation as each side aims to keep pace with their rival(s)?This is a guest post by Mike Hobart.

2022-02-15T22:30:00-05:00,"With Canada's ""Freedom Convoy"" of truckers successfully blocking commerce, officials are taking stronger measures to censor bitcoin donations.The below is a direct excerpt of Marty's Bent Issue #1163: ""If at first you don't succeed label peaceful protestors 'terrorists' and forcibly take their money."" Sign up for the newsletter here.Well that escalated quickly. We've been covering the Freedom Convoy in Canada over the last few weeks. When we first wrote about the subject, GoFundMe had shutdown a campaign dedicated to the cause after being pressured by the Canadian government. In light of this bitcoiners sprung into action to spin up a Tallycoin campaign so that organizers could receive funds directly to wallets that they controlled, eliminating the potential for a trusted third party to freeze and seize the funds. Over the course of last week, that particular campaign gained a lot of traction and attention from the press as many from around the world sent billions of satoshis. Highlighting bitcoin's value prop in relation to the traditional monetary and payment systems that dominate today.Fast forward to today, the Freedom Convoy is going strong and only getting stronger as truckers and those who have joined them have successfully blocked critical commerce routes to send a message to those in power within the Canadian government a message; the protesters are dead serious about getting their rights back. They are digging their feet in and forcing the issue while using peaceful means of non-violent protest that sends a message.The actions taken by the Canadian government to invoke their Emergencies Act, which hasn't been invoked in many decades, to give banks full discretion to freeze and seize funds held in bank accounts and target bitcoin crowdfunding campaigns collecting funds as well is nothing short of egregious Authoritarianism. This move is especially rich coming from a Prime Minister who was asking his countrymen to #ThankATrucker less than two years ago.The fact that Justin Trudeau was pandering to the working class truckers in March of 2020 during the beginning of the pandemic and has now openly declared war on them is indicative of Trudeau's character, which is completely parasitic and opportunistic. In March of 2020 it seems Trudeau was able to recognize how integral the trucking industry was to a well functioning economy. Right now, with the luxury of hindsight, it seems pretty obvious that this gesture was nothing more than political opportunism. After two years of lockdowns and an egregious overreach of government power into the realm of bodily autonomy in the form of mandated experimental vaccines, truckers and many other Canadians alike have decided ""enough is enough"" and are taking matters into their own hands by using their position as a vital part of the Canadian economy to send a message; ""if you want the economy to run smoothly you better ensure that we are able to live free and make decisions for ourselves.""This message does not sit well with Justin Trudeau. He is dead set on making sure that everyone is double jabbed and sufficiently boosted even though the virus seems to be endemic and the dominant variant of the day produces less symptoms than the common cold. Those who do not want to go along with this because they are able to see that the vaccine is harming many people, they already have natural immunity, they are simply willing to take the risk of getting the virus and toughing it out, or have been fully vaccinated and boosted but don't think it should be mandated are being made to be enemies of the state.Taking the leap to labeling those who help raise funds for a peaceful protest as engaging in ""terrorist financing"" is some of the most chilling Orwellian rhetoric your Uncle Marty has come across in his lifetime. Especially considering it comes from a Western Democracy that claims to be a bastion of freedom.The creepy nature of Trudeau's steadfast insistency in regards to mandates makes it hard to believe he isn't trending into tyrant territory. Though, this shouldn't be surprising considering he was a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader and has been one of the biggest proponents of Build Back Better™, a Communist movement being pushed hard on the masses by the WEF itself. Trudeau doesn't really serve the Canadian people and he never has. He serves the unelected supranational power brokers from Davos who want nothing more than to granularly control the global economy and every single man, woman and child breathing on this planet.The stakes for Freedom in the Digital Age have never been higher. Those who are dead set on cattle herding the masses into a digital panopticon are putting the pedal to the metal and attempting to brute force their game plan on the Common Man as quickly as possible. It is imperative that anyone who wants to live free in Canada keeps the pressure up. Do not let these fear mongering tactics deter you from your end goal, living a life of dignity that is free from control of psychotic government officials. The times may seem dark, but they are lashing out like this because your efforts are proving to be extremely effective. You are now locked in a war of attrition with an enemy who is looking more like a tyrannical coward on the global stage day in and day out. It is only a matter of time before you get the freedom you so desperately desire.And in terms of the emergency orders that were just issued; there is nothing they can do to prevent you from receiving and sending bitcoin in a peer-to-peer fashion if you are holding your keys and running your own nodes. They can tell the banks to freeze your funds. They can tell Tallycoin to deny their front-end services to particular campaigns. But the only way they can stop you from signing your private key to broadcast a bitcoin transaction to the network of globally distributed nodes is if they find you and physically stop you from doing so. If enough Canadians hold their private keys, that effort becomes a logistical impossibility. They may get some of you and try to send a message, but they will never be able to get all of you.Viva la revolution!"

2022-02-15T17:00:00-05:00,"Bitcoin education can empower those who have been left behind by legacy financial services.Bitcoin is about people, not price.While the U.S. continues to focus on bitcoin as an investment asset, other parts of the world are showing us the true use cases of Bitcoin. In countries like Argentina, El Salvador and Nigeria, Bitcoin is a means to financial inclusion. The emerging markets demonstrate that Bitcoin has the power to connect the unbanked and underbanked to the larger global financial ecosystem. They are providing a strong foundation for the West, showing us how Bitcoin can reduce wealth inequality and solve some of the world’s greatest financial challenges.In 2021, 18% of American adults were either unbanked or underbanked. The unbanked, often from underinvested communities, did not even have access to a basic bank account, while the underbanked were shut out from banking services based on income or a lack of education. Bitcoin finally changes this narrative, offering a solution for the millions ignored by today's financial system. Peer-to-peer finance provides a real and sustainable alternative to traditional finance for the 99% and beyond, giving the next generation a new chance at economic opportunity. Education on Bitcoin and its true use cases remain the biggest challenge in the U.S. Bitcoin has the power to reduce barriers to wealth for the forgotten seven million who remain unbanked. It is access to financial opportunity for the 100%, bridging the gap for the underrepresented. When mayors from cities like New York and Miami begin to call for Bitcoin education to be taught in schools, we know that our time is now. We’re seeing progress happen across the country. In places like the Bronx, New York, students are being taught the value of peer-to-peer networks as a tool for financial freedom. And at universities, Bitcoin courses are being integrated into their curriculum. But, this is just the beginning of unlocking the true power of Bitcoin education. Through Bitcoin, the people have the opportunity to take financial power back into their own hands, and it’s our responsibility to do our part to fill this gap. By staying connected to the streets, businesses and leaders in the space can utilize their platforms for good. Take El Salvador for example. At Paxful, we’re seeing the need for education on the ground. While the country became the first to roll out bitcoin as legal tender, the biggest challenge for the people remains education. In response, we’ve launched La Casa del Bitcoin, a new education and training center in San Salvador. The center is providing free, no-cost education to anyone interested in learning about the power of Bitcoin and giving them the tools they need to succeed. Bitcoin is a borderless and permissionless technology that was built for the world. It is a tool that can move value across borders and change the way people access the global economy. For Renata Rodrigues, a Paxful user (and employee) in the U.S., bitcoin is a means for supporting her family overseas in Brazil. By buying and selling bitcoin, she is able to avoid expensive remittance fees while also earning a little in return. Addressing the issues of both price and speed in traditional methods of remittance, Bitcoin solves this.The next wave of Bitcoin adoption has begun. With cryptocurrency making its debut at America’s biggest sporting event of the year, we know that we’re on our way to reaching mass adoption. But Bitcoin will never reach its full potential in the U.S. if we continue to view it solely for speculation and investment rather than connecting to its real use cases. Let’s not make the mistake of mirroring it after traditional financial systems and use education to drive financial freedom. Because global Bitcoin adoption begins and ends with education. It’s time to put the “greed is good” narrative to bed and start working for the people. This is a guest post by Ray Youssef.

2022-02-15T16:47:36-05:00,"With its Bitcoin pilot, ConocoPhillips is both monetizing energy that would otherwise be wasted and reducing its emissions.Oil and gas giant ConocoPhillips has indirectly entered the bitcoin mining business.The company has spun up a pilot Bitcoin project in Bakken, North Dakota, through which it sells natural gas that would otherwise be burned for disposal — “flared” — to a bitcoin mining farm operated by a third party, CNBC reported.Bakken houses one of the largest deposits of oil and natural gas in the U.S., a phenomenon that led to the “Bakken oil boom” that made the state of North Dakota the second leading oil-producing state in the country, behind only Texas, according to the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center.ConocoPhillips’ Bitcoin initiative helps it achieve its goal of phasing out the practice of routinely burning off natural gas that it finds while drilling for oil in its largest segments by production.Oil and gas companies have for decades resorted to flaring when gas is produced as a byproduct of oil extraction and there is no nearby infrastructure available to put the gas to use. Even though flaring is better than venting — directly liberating the gas to the air — it still poses some issues; not only does it pollute but it also is wasteful as it is effectively burning money.With its Bitcoin pilot, ConocoPhillips is both monetizing energy that would otherwise be wasted and reducing its environmental impact as the process reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by over 60% compared to routinely flaring, according to research by Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems. On the other side of the spectrum, the mutually-beneficial collaboration enables a bitcoin miner to turn stranded energy into increased security for the Bitcoin network and monetary profits for its business."

2022-02-15T09:54:45-05:00,"Organizations meant to help Ukraine resist occupation by Russia are raising significant amounts of bitcoin donations. But they need to do so more privately.Amid rising tensions between Ukrainian and Russian military forces, Elliptic, a blockchain analysis company, released a report claiming that $570,000 worth of cryptocurrency donations have been sent to multiple non-government organizations in Ukraine resisting Russian forces. Among the range of cryptocurrencies being used by these groups, bitcoin specifically accounts for hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth, with some groups exclusively raising funds in BTC.The analysis firm made this conclusion by tracing wallet addresses posted on websites of these organizations supporting the Ukrainian army. For instance, the picture below was taken from the website for “Come Back Alive,” one of the largest groups supporting the Ukrainian army, which allows a quick path to donations and an even quicker path to traceability paired with the absence of privacy:The bitcoin account listed on a donations page for Come Back Alive. Source.Aptly named from its first donation of bullet-proof vests to the army, inscribed with the words “Come Back Alive,” the easy traceability of this group’s bitcoin donations is significant, since it saw over $200,000 worth of bitcoin donations come in the second half of 2021, per Elliptic. These groups are the meat-space manifestation of the decentralization that Bitcoin is meant to enable. Privacy for one can mean privacy for us all and just because this isn’t your battle today, that doesn’t mean tomorrow is guaranteed. Groups like “Come Back Alive” show us that sovereignty is a necessity in matters of war, but so is privacy. So, how do we fix the easy traceability that this group and others are seeing?Dmytro Kharkov, a former member of the Ukrainian Mamay Institute think tank and current freelance economist and analyst based in Ukraine, emphasized that privacy is of the utmost importance during these rising tensions.“The belief that privacy means less during a war is incorrect. On the contrary, as the war directly threatens people’s lives and property, privacy considerations become central to most people,” Kharkov said. “For example, in 2014 [during the first active phase of the Russo-Ukrainian War], armed terrorists from the so-called DPR and LPR actively expropriated wealth and property, such as automobiles in the occupied regions of Ukraine. Due to the minimal awareness of Bitcoin back then, people were unable to effectively protect their property.”In addition, Kharkov pointed out that the use of bitcoin-based donations and the growing need for their privacy is a trend that will only grow in contemporary warfare.“Moreover, Ukraine’s case illustrates that modern wars include not only conventional warfare but also ideological subversion, propaganda, fake news, cyber warfare, etc.,” he explained. “Under such conditions, privacy becomes the central aspect of people’s freedom preservation. One of the major benefits of Bitcoin is raising the questions of maintaining privacy in the face of war. After considering one’s conditions, technical expertise, plans and preferences, every person can make better-supported decisions.”Clearly, privacy matters. In fact, some might say it matters most in moments like this. But how can groups like “Come Back Alive” maintain their privacy while still allowing potential donors an easy method of providing funds? Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 47 is known as “reusable payment codes for hierarchical deterministic wallets.” It might sound complicated, and it is, but it’s also exceptionally user-friendly once implemented correctly. BIP47 can be broken down into four points:To summarize, a payment code is a decoy address that allows every individual transaction to never re-use the same wallet address, allowing privacy for the reception of funds and privacy for donor identity. Considering that the goal of groups aiding Ukrainian forces is to accept large amounts of donations from givers across the world, the idea of creating a new public address manually, even by the day or week, can seem egregiously burdensome for groups like “Come Back Alive.” Another option is utilizing a BTCPay server, which is an open-source and self-hosted payment processor for Bitcoin. A service like BTCPay allows its users to automate the creation of new addresses for each transaction, though it does require a bit of a self-starter attitude. How does BTCPay offer heightened levels of privacy?BTCPay Server's description of its privacy assurances. Source.According to the BTCPay website:“Re-using an address for receiving payments is a privacy issue. Providing a different address manually to each customer is not an optimal solution. Imagine having to send a unique email to everyone that wants to pay you with cryptocurrency.BTCPay solves the address reuse issue. It automates the checkout process for the merchant by creating a new invoice with a unique address created from the merchant's wallet, each time a customer pays using BTCPay.”While the fact that BTCPay is self hosted means that a certain amount of technical know-how is required to use it, getting past the setup allows for easier, automated maintenance. Organizations like the ones currently supporting the Ukrainian military, could benefit greatly by setting up BTCPay Server, which would utilize the same methods as outlined in BIP47, allowing a single-use address perception to be associated with the identity of the group, while providing donation transactions with a greater level of privacy. Privacy is existential to Bitcoin. Groups like “Come Back Alive” represent decentralized communities organizing around a shared goal — in this case, their belief in resistance to nation-state rule. It is imperative that, when opportunities arise to truly provide an opt-out financial system, the Bitcoin community rally behind that cause and do the due diligence of privacy education. Methods like BIP47, its automation through services like BTCPay, as well as future improved implementations of it, will all be necessary for the preservation of privacy and security at scale."
2022-02-14T19:01:04-05:00,"Superstar rapper Drake won two of his three Super Bowl LVI bets, taking home over $1 million in bitcoin winnings.Viral Canadian rapper Drake made waves last week when he placed over $1.26 million of BTC in bets for Super Bowl LVI, taking to Instagram to show the world his gamble on the Bitcoin casino and sports betting platform, Stake.Drake risked over $471k on the Rams to win outright, receiving a payout of more than $711k. The rapper also placed two other bets which were centered around Rams superstar and Bitcoiner, Odell Beckham Jr. The bets both risked $393k each that Beckham would top 62.5 receiving yards and score at least one touchdown, winning the $844k payout for Odell scoring a first quarter touchdown. Drake did not win his final bet as Beckham's evening ended early because of a knee injury, only completing 52 receiving yards according to CBS Sports.Had the last bet become a reality, Drake would have brought in another $711k in Bitcoin, totaling $2.27 million, but instead walked away with profit of just over $1.5 million. With celebrities like Drake taking big BTC positions in sports betting, the bitcoin sports-betting landscape just got much that more exciting.""This is everything I've ever dreamed of, you know,"" Beckham told CBS Sports. ""And there was a moment I was in the back room and they told me I was done, I couldn't play. And I had to come back out there and be a part of this because it's so much bigger than myself. And these boys pulled through and made it happen.""Last fall, Beckham opted to accept his new salary in bitcoin, becoming one of the latest NFL stars to do so alongside Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers."
2022-02-14T18:30:00-05:00,"Pioneering mathematician John Nash laid out a concept for “Ideal Money” that has parallels with Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.“I think of the possibility that a good sort of international currency might EVOLVE before the time when an official establishment might occur….Here I am thinking of a politically neutral form of a technological utility rather than of a money which might, for example, be used to exert pressures in a conflict situation comparable to 'the cold war'.”–“Ideal Money And Asymptotically Ideal Money”In the age of Keynesian economics evolving toward Modern Monetary Theory, where governments confidently try to print their way out of the “COVID crisis,” seemingly with impunity, we can understand how Bitcoin would be favored from the libertarian viewpoint. This is something that Satoshi foresaw when Bitcoin was in its infancy, writing that, “It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly.”It’s also generally believed that Satoshi designed Bitcoin as a technology that would run counter to the concept that governments should act as their own lenders of last resort. This belief comes from the fact that Bitcoin’s genesis block is timestamped with the headline, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”From a mainstream economics viewpoint, however, Bitcoin is not an “ideal money.” In fact, to most mainstream economists and central bankers, Bitcoin is a very bad money. This is because it has no value stabilization mechanism (aka, inflation control).In response to this mainstream contention on the viability of bitcoin as a globally-adopted currency, the early libertarian Bitcoiners began to propagate a narrative about Bitcoin that has been dubbed the “maximalist” view. This view often draws on Austrian economic themes, as well as what has been formally dubbed by Daniel Krawisz as “Hyperbitcoinization.” In short, the Bitcoin maximalist believes that eventually the citizenry will get so sick of the degradation of the purchasing power of their respective national currencies that there will be a perpetual and self-accelerating process of leaving their respective currencies in order to hold bitcoin, a currency with a destiny to perpetually increase in purchasing power terms (coincidentally, adherence to a “hyperbitcoinization” mindset fits into the definition of the “Nash equilibrium”).However, as bitcoin’s market cap grows, it’s starting to reach people of different political stances, and thus the narrative about what Bitcoin is and should be seems to be evolving.In 2010, Hal Finney commented on what he foresaw as being the future for bitcoin in regard to its existence with the legacy financial system, writing, “Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins.” Finney envisioned, à la George Selgin’s “The Theory Of Free Banking”, that Bitcoin would serve as the base settlement layer between banks which themselves serve a privately-issued currency. Interestingly, and counter to the maximalist narrative, Finney believed, “...such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.”Selgin’s work on free banking involves a thought experiment about a fictional land called Ruritania, in which the initial premise is that there is no monopoly issuer on the base money supply. Although from a national perspective such a premise wouldn’t apply, from a global perspective, and especially with Bitcoin in play, it cannot be said that there exists a single monopolist issuer of money. Off the cuff, most people won’t recognize the name John Nash, however, most from the western world will perk up when they are reminded of the movie “A Beautiful Mind” starring Russell Crowe. The movie portrays a brilliant mathematician that slowly begins to realize he has descended into madness. The movie is based on the life of Nash, however, there are some curious inaccuracies. At the end of the movie, Nash is depicted as taking medication in order to deal with his delusional state of mind. In real life it is well documented that Nash didn’t recover using medication, rather, as he put it in his autobiography, “... gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort. So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists.”But perhaps a more curious mistake in the movie is in the scene in which Nash’s wife tries to explain to him that the letters he has been writing in correspondence with American intelligence were actually never sent. This is provably wrong, as in more recent times one such letter was declassified by the NSA and is published on NSA’s website. It is interesting to note that Ron Rivest and Adi Sharmir (part of the team that invented RSA encryption) have presented that, in this letter, “Nash anticipated the birth of complexity theory a decade later, and the birth of modern cryptography two decades later.”In the letter, Nash explained, “The significance of this general conjecture, assuming its truth, is easy to see. It means that it is quite feasible to design ciphers that are effectively unbreakable.” He went on to write, “The nature of this conjecture is such that I cannot prove it… But this does not destroy its significance.” Here, Nash saw something in regard to an unprovable conjecture and later in the letter he suggested, “...we should try to keep track of the progress of foreign nations towards ‘unbreakable’ types of ciphers.” In one of his last interviews he reminisced on this concept, “...the game is, [governments] don't want it to be understood, where their position is in terms of cryptological competence.""In another correspondence with American intelligence, this time posted on the RAND website, Nash wrote about an insight he called “Parallel Control” in which, “...the idea is to decentralize control.” This paper is interesting as it seems to contain a scaling insight in regard to how computers and computing might evolve in the future, “...isn’t it much better to have one machine [comprised of 100 computers] that takes a day for a problem than 100 which take 100 days for a problem?” Both letters are from the 1950s, just before Nash’s friends, family and colleagues would start to see him as being delusional. “Here Argentina and El Salvador can be mentioned. They are adopting (at least temporarily) expedients that put the value of their domestic money on a fixed relation to the U.S. dollar. And of course Panama has had such a situation for a long time previously. This is not ‘ideal money’ because the U.S. dollar is not an ideal standard for money value...…if, for example, all of the countries of the world would base the value for their national currencies on the value of the British currency then this situation would appear singular and unstable, while it was not so singular for a lot of countries to base their currency value on gold.”–“Currencies Of Improving Quality”Nash eventually received a Nobel prize for another paper from the same time period called “Non-Cooperative Games.” The Nash equilibrium concept he presented in this paper eventually became ubiquitously referenced across many different fields, especially in economics. It is said to be one of the most-cited papers in existence and so much so that often the reference will be used with no formal citation given. In a fourth notable work — in addition to the letter declassified by the NSA, the concept of “Parallel Control” and “Non-Cooperative Games” — Nash presented a solution he called “The Bargaining Problem” which seems to effectively show the value of money in trade. These four papers laid the groundwork for an idea that Nash had at the time, which he eventually called “Ideal Money.” It was at this time, near 1960, that Nash decided to flee to Europe, to exchange his American dollars for Swiss francs, which he felt had a better future quality as measured by the concept he conceived. He was also trying to renounce his American citizenship. It is well written in his biographies that the U.S. military tracked him down and brought him back to his homeland (as he says) “in chains.” He won the Nobel prize in 1994 for “Non-Cooperative Games” and began touring the world, speaking and writing about “Ideal Money” in 1995.“...my talk linking the ‘ideal money’ with the choices and actions of ‘thrift’ or ‘savings’ by persons or by ‘economic agents’ was influenced by concerns that it would be wise not to speak too incautiously of ‘the Keynesians’ when the times are such that massive public opinions may be supporting actions by which a state administration can act without going through the parliamentary processes to write new legislation…Therefore, I had arranged for 2012 to talk more cautiously in relation to whatever would impact with ‘the Keynesians’ and with the political interests relating also to the scholarly factions allied with (or forming) ‘the Keynesians.’ And this caution carries over naturally to 2013 also.”–NashFor the last 20 years of his life, since 1995, Nash had been touring the world cautiously and with obfuscation, professing his idea as to how the global financial system could be arranged in an ideal fashion. It is interesting to compare the ends of Nash’s proposal with Satoshi’s alleged distaste for banking bailouts. Nash explained in “Ideal Money”, “This standard, as a basis for the standardization of the value of the international money unit, would remove, where it would be used, the political roles of the ‘grand pardoners.’”“The ultimately launched concept of ‘Ideal Money’ became possible when I conceived of a practical basis for a standardization of the comparison of the value of the currency with an appropriate standard or ideal. And the key to that was the idea of an ICPI or (international) ‘Industrial Consumption Price Index.’”–Nash, “Asymptotically Ideal Money”Nash formally entered his proposal for “Ideal Money” in the Southern Economic Journal’s July 2002 edition. Based on the notion that “There is tremendous value in simply having prices quoted conveniently” as outlined in “The Bargaining Problem,” Nash began to consider what he called an “Industrial Consumption Price Index” (ICPI), much like that of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) metric that the central banks of today use to target inflation, but instead, Nash wrote about a single index that all central banks would agree to share. The concept is something that he extrapolated from the favorability of the gold standard, but with an array of prices in order to decentralize some of the weaknesses of the singular nature of a gold standard:“Nowadays, however, few would propose a return to the actual use of simply the metal gold as a standard, for the following reasons. (i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitably mine gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer. However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor. (ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be ‘politically appealing’ so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas. (iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such that even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.” –“Ideal Money”The general idea of having a basket of commodities prices that are used to measure inflation, whether on a national level or a global level, is not perfectly unique to Nash’s proposal. Indeed, in a since-deleted tweet, George Selgin said on the matter, “his commodity-basket stnd. Neither novel nor very appealing”. Coincidentally, in “Ideal Money And Asymptotically Ideal Money,” Nash almost seems to respond, “....on a topic with such a universal relevance to human affairs, it is difficult, really, to say something new. But there can be novelty in the details and in terms of the context and the times.”Saifedean Ammous, famous for his narrative entitled “The Bitcoin Standard,” also opined on the concept of Nash’s “Ideal Money” and ICPI, tweeting, “It's just another centrally planned currency, based on ridiculous price stability index measurements.”However, although Nash did invoke the concept of the ICPI in his proposal, he didn’t actually propose it as the basis for his argument. Instead, he explained that he saw a different way that the world currencies might find inter-relational stability (bold emphasis added):“It seems possible and not unlikely, however, that if two states evolve towards having currencies of more stable value as measured locally by national CPI indices that then also these distinct currencies would tend to evolve towards more stable comparative relations of value. Then the limiting or ‘asymptotic’ result of such an evolutionary trend would be in effect ‘ideal money’ but this as a result achieved without the adoption of anything like an ICPI index as a basis for the standard of value.”Of “Ideal Money,” pioneering Bitcoin advocate Adam Back has tweeted, “also not convinced Nash’s ideal money ideas are that much to do with bitcoin. If i understand he just proposed 0% inflation as objective and kind of SDR variant, but somehow linked to ICPI basket of commodities as a way to construct it.”It’s interesting to see the willingness of people to opine on Nash’s proposal and to see how few of them have actually traversed the works.In fact, it is Nash himself who defeats his own concept, the ICPI, showing that he only named it so that he can speak to it for the lack of a better comparison:“We can see that times could change, especially if a ‘miracle energy source’ were found, and thus if a good ICPI is constructed, it should not be expected to be valid as initially defined for all eternity. It would instead be appropriate for it to be regularly readjusted depending on how the patterns of international trade would actually evolve. Here, evidently, politicians in control of the authority behind standards could corrupt the continuity of a good standard…”Put another way, if the cost of the production of one or some commodities in the ICPI was dramatically reduced by a technological advance, the composition of the internationally-chosen basket of commodities would need to be readjusted. As Nash noted (above in regard to gold), the location of the production of commodities can be a source of political tension if they are “monetized” (i.e., selected as part of the index), therefore political conflict would be expected to arise at each re-adjustment period of the basket. Although useful as a notion, the ICPI is a political non-starter. Nonetheless, Nash left us with the advantages and weaknesses of the concept.“The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.”–Satoshi NakamotoHere we consider the possibility of using the price of bitcoin as the sole commodity in an internationally-held inflation target. Firstly, in regard to the weakness of the geographical location of “Bitcoin mines” we can note that “bitcoin-to-be-mined” do not reside in any certain physical location. More importantly, we can consider the effect of a “miracle energy source” if bitcoin was used as a measure of purchasing power stability of major currencies — if the cost to mine bitcoin decreased dramatically, miners would flood the network looking to profit, however, the difficulty adjustment algorithm would eventually increase the cost to mine. From this view, it becomes apparent that Satoshi solved the problem that Nash outlined.“If in each of the corresponding states the authorities were using, in some sense, ‘inflation targeting’ then necessarily they would have some sort of a price index that could be related to their issued currency. But it would ALSO be very natural for each state to look at the comparative behaviour, in terms of value, of the other leading currencies.Thus second order index comparisons become possible where the authorities in a state would look not only at domestic prices but also at international value comparisons.And now we have only to imagine that a ‘groundswell’ of ‘popular demand’ for minimal inflation……the responsible authorities and governments so that they would so control the ‘supply side’ of their money management activities so as to achieve that (supposed to be popularly desired) result.”–“Ideal Money And Asymptotically Ideal Money” Paul Storcz, famous for his drivechain BIP, gave his contention with Nash’s proposal, saying that Bitcoin can’t be a basis for Nash’s “Ideal Money” because it is expected to have a deflationary nature (purchasing power increases over time) and Nash’s proposal calls for 0% inflation as it’s target. However, this view conflates definitions in a way that is difficult for some to understand. Inflation has many different definitions. One of the relevant definitions is a general decrease in the purchasing power of the money considered. A central bank has a similar but slightly nuanced definition of inflation because it further defines inflation through a set of prices which it uses as a specific lens for comparison. If the exchange price of bitcoin was used as the new metric for inflation, then 0% inflation would be achieved if the exchange price of the respective currency was stable in relation to bitcoin. This would be called “0% inflation” even if it were obvious that the respective currency was increasing in purchasing power by the definition of a general decrease in prices. “…and little by little, specialists were becoming more to the point… and… he was putting everybody to contribution, as a conductor you know, ‘Hey my friend I need you to prove this and this. I think that you are the expert and you can give me this, I can use it to prove something more…’ As a conductor who would give assignments you know, ‘Here you are the violin player you play this and this. You are the trumpet you play this and this.’ Each one does their part, nobody understands the great plan except when the orchestra starts to play. And Nash had the whole plan for this. And everyone was amazed when it was six months… putting all the people to contribution. Everyone knows this as the Nash inequality. The truth is, Nash didn’t prove this inequality. He asked one of his colleagues… to prove the inequality… an expert in this kind of thing. ‘You want this inequality, yeah let me prove it for you, here’s how you do it’. ‘Thank you.’ And Nash would use it in that problem of distribution. He was a genius in these kind of integrating parts…”–Cedric VillaniThis article doesn’t intend to opine on whether or not Nash had anything to do with the creation of Bitcoin. However, given the consideration, it is often asked if Nash would have been capable of creating the code for Bitcoin. The above attestation by Villani is interesting to consider in this regard and indeed Nash was working on a different research project which happened to involve the same programming language that Satoshi used to implement Bitcoin. Nash was, in fact, quite familiar with computers. When asked if he considered himself a technophile, he once answered, “I’d like to think of myself that way… I was working with computers, it was sort of my big pastime… it was my cognitive therapy in my early days.”“So it occurs to me to think that that which is not achieved by a grand action of establishment by ‘fiat’ may alternatively tend to come into existence as a consequence of a process of evolution. And of course, after a certain degree of progress by ‘evolution’ the rest of the progress could possibly be realized by a convention or a process of ‘fiat.’”–“Asymptotically Ideal Money”Mainstream economists are often quoted as saying that Bitcoin is no more than a speculative Ponzi scheme. This would certainly be the conclusion if you believed the intention of Bitcoin is to replace the existing major currencies. However, it simply cannot, as it is inherently volatile with no accurate stabilization mechanism. Nonetheless, the cost and speed to settle with Bitcoin versus traditional systems (and especially with something like gold) doesn’t compare if we consider high-value transactions. From this view, it is only the liquidity and market cap that make bitcoin inferior to the legacy settlement media. As Bitcoin’s market grows, settling the highest-value transactions that happen in our global economy becomes very attractive (cheap and fast) using Bitcoin. At this point, considering Selgin’s Ruritanian view, Bitcoin will asymptotically begin to stabilize the existing major legacy currencies. We should expect this to happen, not because of cooperation and political altruism, but as the process of settlement allows the international markets to favor the higher-quality (lower-inflation) currencies over those that are not managed as well in this regard. That this would happen through the direct competition of the currencies (and want of central banks to survive!) rather than the will and morality of the central banking system seems to defeat the idea of Eric Voskuil, a contention he calls the “Ideal Money Fallacy” in which he argues, “States only surrender this [inflation] tax under extreme duress and in such cases only briefly.”The script or plan for my talk linking 'Ideal Money' with the choices and actions of 'thrift' or 'savings' by persons or by 'economic agents' was influenced by concerns that it would be wise not to speak too incautiously of the Keynesians when the times are such that massive public opinions may be supporting actions by which a state administration can act without going through the parliamentary processes to write new legislation.–Memo by NashNash's argument is difficult to understand. He seems like an awkward speaker, he uses an old style of English. But he also has a past that would provide a very good reason to fear state reprisal — namely, through insulin shock therapy.These days, it might be easier to see how it would be wise to speak cautiously about such a proposal that, “would remove, where it would be used, the political roles of the ‘grand pardoners,’ the state authorities that can forgive the debts.""""The ultimately launched concept of ‘Ideal Money’ became possible when I conceived of a practical basis for a standardization of the comparison of the value of the currency with an appropriate standard or ideal. And the key to that was the idea of an ICPI or (international) ‘Industrial Consumption Price Index.’–""Asymptotically Ideal Money”Nonetheless, we understand the proposal through the ICPI, not the misconception of it being the basis for the proposal, but rather by using it to construct an ideal basis for our global monetary systems. We consider the strengths of such a proposal and then recognize the weaknesses are fatal — that if the cost to produce relevant commodities dramatically changed, it would take a politically-based cooperative to readjust the globally held basket of commodities. And, finally, note that Satoshi's difficulty adjustment algorithm solves this weakness while retaining all of the stated strength of the ICPI.i·de·al: existing only in the imagination; desirable or perfect but not likely to become a reality.This is a guest post by Jal Toorey.

2022-02-14T18:00:00-05:00,"Here’s why adopting bitcoin is the most important action conservatives can take today.Dear Conservatives, I was blessed to have been surrounded by many positive, conservative role models during my childhood. Otherwise, I would probably be another leftist zoomer that has replaced family with the government and God with the self. Values that were once commonplace in the west: family, religion, limited government, personal responsibility, and delayed gratification, have now been labeled as extreme. However, due to the self-destruction that occurs as a result of an over-reliance on the state, the appeal of conservatism is becoming more and more obvious. Note the mass exodus in 2021 from blue states to red states. As someone who wants to see conservatism become mainstream I feel it is my duty to call conservatives out in regard to a topic that is being overlooked by many on the right. Conservatives are egregiously undervaluing the importance of Bitcoin. Bitcoin not only aligns with our values but it also serves as one of our best weapons to fight back against a tyrannical government.Firstly, we on the right understand the importance of voting with our dollars. Commonly dubbed “Get Woke, Go Broke”, the strategy of boycotting woke companies that spit in the face of conservative values has proven to be an effective one. The current news cycle has Carhartt facing this backlash but many other brands have faced the same. If there is any organization that has shown to have complete disregard for conservative values it is the United States government. With annual federal spending at $6.8 trillion and annual federal tax revenue at $4 trillion, an abandonment of fiat currency would force an instant $2.8 trillion cut in federal spending. Should we exodus away from the dollar, then the federal government would struggle to fund all of the three-letter agencies that infringe upon so many of our liberties. The U.S. government has gone woke and we can make them go broke by boycotting the dollar and storing our wealth in bitcoin. I believe that after what happened in 2020, it should be obvious that voting at the ballot box isn’t the answer. Vote with your wallet. Buying bitcoin and getting it off the exchange is a vote for free market currency. Storing large sums of cash in a savings account is a vote for currency that comes with printing privileges for members of the elite class.Conservatives value personal responsibility. There is no greater responsibility than taking self-custody of your own private keys; relying on nobody but yourself to store the wealth of your family. Moreover, you can run your own node and personally verify that your transactions are confirmed on the blockchain. This is infinitely superior to waiting for an email confirmation from your bank that your money was sent or received. For the conservative influencers that have had their PayPal accounts shut down or their GoFundMe campaigns stopped by the big tech oligarch;, bitcoin is your solution.Many conservatives, myself included, often turn to the wisdom of our founding fathers. Any time we refer to an act of the state as “unconstitutional” we are defending ourselves with the fact we were each created in the image of God and with certain rights that exist beyond the scope of government. The founding fathers understood this concept and used it as the bedrock for American civilization. By its mere existence the Federal Reserve Board is dancing on the graves of the founding fathers. To quote Thomas Jefferson: “The Central Bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of our constitution.” Money is what allows a free market to operate. Without sound money it is impossible for any individual to have adequate information, in the form of accurate prices, to make the best possible economic decisions for themselves. Furthermore, a lack of sound money requires an individual to become a part-time financial advisor in order to merely outpace inflation and save the fruits of their labor. By using a currency whose supply can be so easily manipulated by the government we are choosing to live in a country that does not even take seriously its own founding documents. In our society the main ideological battle is between left-wing authoritarians who want to control the lives of others and those that value basic economic and individual freedom; pro-lockdown corona-bros versus people who don’t want to live in a world where they must ask their government for permission to go outside; authoritarianism versus individualism. Having surrounded myself with Bitcoiners for over a year now, I can count on one hand the number of Bitcoiners I have met that I would place in the authoritarian category. (I can’t say the same for altcoiners. In my experience most altcoiners do not tend to have the same values as Bitcoiners. Don’t get duped by shitcoin propaganda.) Regardless of what label you use, “conservative,” “libertarian,” “the right,” etc., most Bitcoiners are supportive of individual freedoms. Bitcoiners will be fighting alongside conservatives if America becomes more like Australia or Canada. We are coming up on two years of nation-states abusing COVID-19 to increase their control; I doubt it stops anytime soon. My appeal is to those people that are on the side of individual freedom but have yet to become a laser-eyed Bitcoin maximalist. Bitcoin is the answer to the problem of big government. Since the spawn of Bitcoin in 2010, we have seen it absorb value from the dollar as well as the monetary savings premium that we have placed on non-cash assets such as real estate and equities. This is a phenomena that we will continue to see over the next decade and beyond. If conservatives can be on the winning side of this transfer of wealth then we will have the resources necessary to create a better world for our children. “New Vintage 2021 Population Estimates Available for the Nation, States and Puerto Rico.” Census Bureau, 21 December 2021, https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2021-population-estimates.html.

2022-02-14T17:00:00-05:00,"The decentralized nature of Bitcoin can serve to provide a source of security for communities in America.The effort to change America’s psychosis with race relations and the passive-aggressive hold that unfettered capitalism has on its core operating system is connected. How many times have you seen the flag at your local post office or town hall at “half-mast?” This week in New York two police officers were killed in the line of duty, and we were reminded as they lowered flags around the city. I am sure it occurs to most people that in America we have reached a point where the Stars and Stripes are rarely allowed to fly from the top of its pole, almost out of shame for the seemingly never-ending instances of mass shootings, race and gender conflict, and politically-inspired mob scenes. This problem has a long arc with many trying and failing to effect change. Groups as diverse as the Nation of Islam and modern-day democratic socialists have a common cause, to bring some structures of integrity to their community. In this article, we will also discover how forward-looking measures like universal basic income can be hijacked when tried in America. Expanding the use case for bitcoin can offer positive outcomes for all of these progressive movements looking for autonomy from the system.Malcolm X had a goal to change his community but his first hurdle was changing himself. As a convert to Islam, there were a great many habits that the former criminal had to alter. The Nation of Islam saw itself as the salve for the black community and Malcolm was a spearhead in New York for their cause. Amongst his heated rhetoric was his more homespun discussions on the changes in his diet, the bean pie for instance was a key symbol of a radical departure from the traditional soul food he grew up on, food that he felt was poisoning his community. It was symbolic not only because it provided a healthy alternative to greasy meals common to Harlemites, but it could be easily produced and sold in small businesses that belonged to black citizens in New York. The story of Malcolm X demonstrates self-reliance is key to escaping from repression, beginning with something as simple as a bean pie. A through line from the early days of civil rights marches to today is Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. His popularity in two U.S. presidential campaigns was emblematic of problems vexing the minds of Americans now. He was the first candidate for the highest office in the land to openly call himself a democratic socialist and a huge portion of the voting population, especially the young, were on board for this type of change. In his way, he was touching on what, in this author’s opinion, is the same core issue that Bitcoin solves — that is, a deep suspicion of capitalism and those who wield power within its structures. Although the platform Senator Sanders put forth did not attack fiat currency per se, it did imagine a fiscal policy that served the people before powerful special interests. The question regarding these struggles, civil rights, and the fight against income inequality is, what do they all have in common? It is a desire for autonomy from a society of racist thought, unfair political bias, a lack of an even playing field, and many more cultural hurdles. Imagine if Malcolm X had been able to read Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper on Bitcoin and realized that it could open the door to his community acting as their bank and benefactor outside the tyranny, as he perceived it, of the American system?As every day passes new use cases are being developed for Bitcoin, beyond the idea of massive “gains.” Something we may take for granted in America is having a bank account; however, there are over 2 billion people on earth that are “unbanked.” This sad state of affairs denies the benefits of digital commerce to a giant and innovative population. What we are seeing now in El Salvador and soon in other countries, is this banking hurdle being conquered by an application of the Lightning Network that allows unbanked citizens to make transactions with bitcoin on their mobile phones. This same functionality can be used for communities who desire to act outside or alongside typical monetary conventions. Whatever their reason, bitcoin properly employed can assist them to find agency and freedom that would also reduce the need to get involved with extreme or antisocial behavior. This by-product of bitcoin use suggests a progressive society rather than a simple rally call for a libertarian financial system. Some Bitcoin maximalists may call for the end of fiat currency; we all may find in providing freedom from fiat tyranny there is a chance that global monetary policy could reform.Can $500 change your life? Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton, California asked himself this question and began a two-year experiment in his sleepy community by implementing universal basic income (UBI). The concept is simple — every citizen in the program receives $500 a month with no strings attached. Although the full report will not be completed until later in 2022, initial indications are that this bridge amount made a huge impact on the people of Stockton. People tended to pay debts, maintained employment when car repairs would have otherwise hamstrung them, and reduced stress for mothers who needed to afford essentials for their children, in essence improving the mental health of Stockton. The long-term viability of UBI can be debated but the political reality of what happened in Stockton cannot. Mayor Tubbs became celebrated in the national press for his compelling life story and courage to help the poor. However, during the entire UBI experiment, he had left himself open to growing criticism on social media. A right-wing-inspired blog portrayed him as someone recklessly handing out taxpayer money. He lost his office to a Republican challenger who is unlikely to continue the UBI stipends. The point is, had the program had a bitcoin component as part of the UBI payments, there might have been increased long-term value to recipients. The UBI program could have outlived the winds of political change. Economic uncertainty in communities and on the individual level is to blame for the lion’s share of America’s woes. Imagine townships that could augment tax windfalls with bitcoin backing to ensure the financing of schools and public works? Further, imagine the budget of your city hall on a transparent blockchain to avoid corruption? It will take some leadership like that was displayed by newly-elected New York mayor Eric Adams. He made public that he would be converting his first paycheck as mayor into bitcoin despite a price downswing. These are important steps to the mass adoption of a decentralized source of leverage and the end of disaster fatigue in America.This is a guest post by Scott Dennis.

2022-02-14T15:18:20-05:00,"Bitcoiners raised almost $1 million for the Canadian freedom truckers and now organizers strategize on how to distribute the funds.Bitcoin fundraising for the Ottawa Freedom Truckers Convoy has met its goal of 21 bitcoin with more donations still flowing in. Now, over 22 bitcoin worth more than $932k has been raised from 5,511 donors.The fundraising committee is in the process of consolidating the bitcoin that has been raised and are focusing on how best to get the funds to the truckers. The key holders for the wallets containing funds are tentatively the Ottawa freedom convoy leaders (Freedom Convoy Nonprofit Organization) but this will change shortly.Since centralized crowdfunding platforms GoFundMe and GiveSendGo are no longer viable fundraising options, with even Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank freezing bank accounts used to raise funds for the truckers, bitcoin is fulfilling a key role allowing the protesters to escape financial censorship.Image Source20% of funds raised are being consolidated in a hardware wallet for the truckers organizers to use for immediate needs including food, hotel rooms, legal aid and fuel.80% of funds raised are being consolidated into a multisig wallet. They are using nunchuk.io multisig wallet because “it makes collaborative custody through multisig intuitive and easy to use for non technical users,” protest organizer and Bitcoin activist, Nobody Caribou told Bitcoin Magazine.Fundraising committee member BTC Sessions told Bitcoin Magazine:“For security reasons, we found it to be important that the key holders are not publicly identifiable. There is a new multisig quorum now. Only Nobody Caribou and BJdichter (one of the truckers) are privy to who holds keys. Myself, Greg, and Jeff Booth no longer hold keys, as we were previously points of failure. We ran the risk of 3 key holders within Canada being coerced to give up the Bitcoin. This is no longer the case.”Options for how to get these funds out to truckers are being considered and will likely depend on the wishes of the truckers. Proposals being considered depending on how the truckers want to receive funds:Among other strategies, organizers are considering using Opendimes, a small USB stick that allows you to spend and transfer bitcoin like a dollar bill, to get bitcoin to the truckers — although no decisions have been made.As the country explodes with enthusiasm in their fight for freedom, blockades are going up at a number of Canada-US border crossings from Ontario to British Columbia.One reporter compared it to whack a mole — as one crossing blockade is closed down they move on to the next crossing.For the bitcoin fundraising liaison and committee, this is beyond their expectations so they’ve tentatively decided to limit funds to truckers in Ottawa.This is new territory both for the fundraisers and the convoy organizers and shows that freedom is a priority for many people as donations continue to come in from around the globe, Nobody Caribou told Bitcoin Magazine."
2022-02-14T13:27:32-05:00,"The commission will have 180 days to submit a report detailing findings, determinations, and recommendations on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency legislation.Chris Sununu, Governor of the U.S. state of New Hampshire, last week signed an executive order establishing a commission to investigate current Bitcoin-related laws and propose new ones as the state seeks to encourage innovation and attract businesses in the financial services sector.“New Hampshire is a hub of financial innovation, and this Executive Order will further our commitment to attracting high quality banking and financial businesses in a safe and responsible manner,” Governor Chris Sununu said in a statement.The commission will research U.S. federal and state legislation governing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency to determine their effects on innovation and economic competitiveness of New Hampshire and the country and privacy and liberty rights of citizens, according to the order. Any recommendations to amend changes to such legislations or improve them will need to be justified by the commission.“I am excited for the work this Commission will undertake and the recommendations they will provide so that New Hampshire can continue to advance necessary reforms that promote economic growth, foster innovation, and meet changing customer needs while ensuring safety, soundness, and consumer protection,” Sununu said in a statement.The executive order grants the commission a maximum of 180 days to submit a report detailing its “findings, determinations and recommendations to the Governor, the Speaker of the House, and the President of the Senate.” Additionally, the commission’s report will be made publicly available on the Governor’s office website.According to the order, the commission will be composed of the State Attorney General, the Commissioner of the Bank Department, a state senator, a state representative, a representative of the New Hampshire Bankers Association, a representative of the Cooperative Credit Union Association, “three public members with recognized experience with cryptocurrencies, digital assets and the provision of services to institutions or consumers with respect to digital assets,” and three additional members appointed by Governor Sununu."
2022-02-14T12:12:08-05:00,"With impending confirmation as the country’s top banking supervisor, will Sarah Bloom Raskin implement a bitcoin bias in Federal Reserve regulation?Sarah Bloom Raskin. Source.Progressive darling Sarah Bloom Raskin testified in Congress before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month, in a hearing regarding her confirmation as the country’s top banking supervisor. The vote will take place tomorrow in the U.S. Senate. Highlights of the testimony are detailed below.Raskin is the pick to fill the important vice chair and head of supervision role for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. This is a relatively new position at the Fed, created by Congress in 2010 following the Great Financial Crisis. The head of supervision sets rules for banks’ required capital levels and balance-sheet liquidity and oversees compliance to the rules. It is also an important position for any shaping of new bitcoin regulations, as far as they might apply to U.S. banks.This nomination shows that the administration likely favors tighter financial regulation and wants someone who is able to use the Fed’s powers to further specific political initiatives.Raskin is no stranger to high positions in D.C., but has never faced any opposition to her previous appointments, which demonstrates that the Beltway is changing. This time, she might face a quite narrow vote, but is expected to be confirmed.During President Obama’s second term, Raskin served as the deputy Treasury secretary from 2014 through the end of his term in January 2017. Prior to this role at the U.S. Treasury, she was a governor at the Federal Reserve and served on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania summed up the controversy around her appointment succinctly in a statement reported by The Washington Post, saying, “I have serious concerns that she would abuse the Fed’s narrow statutory mandates on monetary policy and banking supervision to have the central bank actively engaged in capital allocation. Such actions not only threaten both the Fed’s independence and effectiveness, but would also weaken economic growth.”The U.S. Chamber of Commerce uncharacteristically wrote an open letter in opposition to Raskin’s appointment:“Ms. Raskin has been critical of the Federal Reserve for allowing oil and gas companies to access the emergency 13(3) facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. She has also advocated for federal regulators to transition financing away from the fossil fuel industry in her writings and public comments.”Fear mongering in Congress has failed to satisfactorily advance the progressive climate agenda. Perhaps a new strategy is being hatched to use the Fed’s power over banking regulations, through unelected bureaucrats, to “influence” banks participation in selective credit access.Raskin told lawmakers in March 2020 that “If we ignore climate change, we in essence destroy the economy.” This sentiment parrots the globalist Davos talking points from the European Central Bank and Bank of England, which typically use false equivalence between climate risks and systemic risks. Thought of in a different way, issues like climate change are exactly what the market is best at adapting to, while inflexible and draconian regulations will serve to make the market unable to adapt to even minor changes.Many members of Congress are concerned that Raskin will not adhere strictly to the Fed’s dual mandate, taking it into the realm of influencing the allocation of capital and indirectly picking winners and losers.Raskin’s views on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and bitcoin directly are less clear. She has been more focused on “cyber” threats like hacking. We can, however, assume that her views on stablecoins, bitcoin and CBDCs align with those of friend and loud bitcoin opponent Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other globalist central bankers from Europe. Raskin’s husband, Jamie Raskin, is a progressive U.S. Representative from Maryland, who endorsed Warren for reelection recently, has sponsored and written many progressive bills and managed the second President Trump impeachment hearing (conducted after Trump had left office). This history and more demonstrate that this is a hyper-partisan family.These views would put Sarah Raskin in direct opposition to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s stances on CBDCs, stablecoins and bitcoin regulation. As head of supervision, she would have influence on Federal Reserve functions, but it is uncertain if this will be enough to outweigh the strict non-political stance of the Federal Reserve in this regard under Powell. It also must be acknowledged that as vice chair, Raskin would be a contender for the role of Federal Reserve chairman in four years. That could threaten to turn the Federal Reserve into a much more political body. Hopefully, bitcoin will be too big by then to even think about fighting.The importance to the Bitcoin industry of Raskin’s climate activism in the U.S. is obvious. Raskin’s progressive peers have spread misinformation about bitcoin mining’s environmental impact but have been unable to make headway on turning that into actual legislation. In fact, bitcoin is strengthening energy grids’ and energy companies’ ability to deal with extraordinary market events.The man whom Raskin is nominated to replace, Randal Quarles, made a speech in May 2021, in which he showed an uncommonly strong understanding of the complications and dangers of CBDCs, and the uniqueness of bitcoin. He was a bulwark at the Federal Reserve against much of the globalist CBDC agenda. Replacing him with a person of opposite views could dramatically shift the balance at the Fed.It seems probable that Raskin will come after Bitcoin through banking regulations. That wouldn’t be all bad. If she makes it a crusade, it will elevate bitcoin in the global monetary conversation, cracking open the Overton window.Watching the Congressional testimony starting at the 1:03:30 mark demonstrates Senator Toomey holding Raskin’s feet to the fire. Toomey uses her own words, saying that the Federal Reserve should “influence” banks’ allocation of capital decisions. Her answers to his questions were not straightforward, repeating that she believes the Fed should not and cannot make allocation of capital decisions. That skirted the question.Another entertaining back and forth happens at the 1:33:20 mark, with Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana deploying his typical style. Her answers and body language were off putting and conceited. She once again repeated that the Fed should not pick winners or losers, but failed to say that the Fed should not “influence” banks’ capital allocation decisions.The real fireworks started at the 1:55:50 mark, when Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, a friend of Bitcoin, took the mic and absolutely grilled Raskin about Federal Reserve master account access, and her possible indecent connection to the one and only fintech company with a master account, which received that master account while Raskin was on its board in 2018.Lummis laid out compelling circumstantial evidence, that Raskin served at the Fed from 2010 to 2014, then the Treasury from 2014 to 2017. After her time in government, she joined the board of Reserve Trust in Colorado, which was denied a master account in 2017, but then was granted a master account after Raskin made a call to the St. Louis Federal Reserve on its behalf. Again, it’s important to note that it is the only non-bank to be given that honor, even as dozens in Lummis’ home state of Wyoming have failed to make headway in the last two-and-a-half years. A year after the master account was secured, Raskin left the board, bought out for $1.5 million. Mic drop.This is a guest post by Ansel Lindner.

2022-02-14T09:33:01-05:00,"Listen To This Episode:In this episode of ""Bitcoin, Explained,"" hosts Aaron van Wirdum and Sjors Provoost were joined by resident sidechain and Layer 2 expert Ruben Somsen, once again, this time to discuss Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs). DLCs are a type of smart contracts for Bitcoin, first proposed by Lightning Network white paper co-author Tadge Dryja. In essence, DLCs are a way to perform bets — but this means that they can ultimately be leveraged for all sorts of financial instruments, including futures markets, insurances and stablecoins. At the start of the episode, van Wirdum, Provoost and Somsen discussed what can be considered a type of proto-DLC, namely a multi-signature setup for sports betting where two participants add a neutral third party (an “oracle”) that can resolve the bet one way or the other if needed. The trio explained that how this solution comes with a number of downsides, like the difficulty of scaling it. From there, van Wirdum, Provoost and Somsen went on to explain how DLCs solved these problems using a setup that resembles payment channels as used on the Lightning Network. When structured like this, they explained, oracles merely need to publish a cryptographically-signed message about the outcome of an event, which can be used by the winning participant of the bet to create a withdrawal transaction from the payment channel. Finally, Somsen explained how the original DLC concept could be streamlined by using adaptor signatures, a sort of “incomplete signatures” that can be made complete using the signed message from the oracle. With adaptor signatures, DLCs no longer require a separate withdrawal transaction, as the winner can claim funds from the payment channel directly."
2022-02-14T09:26:02-05:00,"Watch This Episode On YouTubeListen To This Episode:Hyperbitcoinization is happening in real time. For fiat, the end is nigh, and no one explains this better than Brian Harrington. For him, Bitcoin is a lifestyle. Every day, the actions he takes center around furthering Bitcoin. Harrington and I discussed many interesting topics in this episode of “Meet The Plebs,” but none are as fascinating to him as the “get on zero” movement. Described as maximally limiting your exposure to fiat usage and holdings, Harrington talked about how this movement is a part of making hyperbitcoinization the reality of today. We also discussed planning for the future, stress and many other interesting topics. Be sure to check out the written interview below, and the podcast as well.How were you first introduced to Bitcoin?I have one email from my dad from 2014 that has the word “Bitcoin” in it and he was talking to me about a trading bot that he was trying to run on Mt Gox. In January 2015, we then both made our Coinbase accounts together.What are some considerations bitcoiners should begin thinking about as they plan for long-term wealth (retirement, taxes, etc.)?I think Bitcoiners should begin thinking now about what they want to do with their influence that is going to come from being long-term wealthy. We have a huge opportunity to really put a dent in changing the world for the better. It’s impossible for bitcoin to 10x and 100x from here without Bitcoiners also 10xing and 100xing.What strategies can Bitcoiners use to lessen the stress of planning for their future?Different stacks for different things. Bitcoin is going to eat checking accounts, savings accounts and retirement accounts. Bitcoin is the new base money. Hold different stacks of it in different places for different goals. If you still have fiat or stonks sitting in a retirement account, seriously take a look at Choice App, you can transfer and rollover from wherever your retirement currently is and get it into bitcoin.What does “get on zero” mean, and why is it important? #GetOnZero means stop holding fiat for any longer than you have to. Fiat doesn’t work at all for saving over long time frames and the timeframe that it does hold purchasing power to goods and services is shortening and shortening. #GetOnZero is working the muscles for using bitcoin as your day-to-day base money. All the tools are available to use bitcoin as your base money, you can get paid with it and pay your bills from that stack, so it’s time to look at the math on if that makes sense. When you look at the daily average increase of BTC and you look at the daily average decrease of fiat, it becomes clear that you will end the year wealthier by using BTC fully as your base money.Why is Bitcoin-oriented community action important (meetups, etc.)?Advancing Bitcoin in your community is important because that’s where you live. Those are the physical humans creating goods and services around you and the physical humans that can make where you live a thriving place. The more people close to you operating on a Bitcoin standard, the better.What’s the primary change for the world you want to see come out of the adoption of Bitcoin?The number one change I want to see for the world is ending time theft through money debasement in this generation. I don’t want our kids to experience time theft.What are you most looking forward to in the Bitcoin space?#GetOnZero is the newest, freshest thing happening and my favorite thing happening right now. All the tools are available to use bitcoin as your base money. We can all do our part to reduce our fiat footprint and drain our productivity from the old world."
2022-02-13T15:00:00-05:00,"Thinking about the potential Bitcoin-oriented geopolitical moves to be made only shows the unlimited possibilities of Bitcoin’s game theory.Read ""A Look At The Game Theory Of Bitcoin,"" the first part of this series, here.In this article I will suggest potential routes for Bitcoin’s game theory to play out. So, what is game theory? In layman's terms, if you are playing any game of strategy, whether it be chess, basketball, football, Battleship, Monopoly or checkers, any move you make in the game will have to be countered by your opponent. The strategic decisions that you and your opponent make will ultimately determine who wins and who loses the game. This is game theory in its most simplistic form.Undoubtedly, the countries with the highest inflation rates will adopt bitcoin first and will be the greatest beneficiaries. Countries like the U.S. may take a longer time, as they will still be hyperinflating their currencies with their powerful seigniorage they hold. When these superpowers do eventually adopt bitcoin, all the countries who adopted it first will get an economic boost and be lifted to a more even playing field with the most powerful countries. This is how powerful Bitcoin can be for a country who willingly accepts it.Small countries in Latin America, Africa and many other regions of the world whose money is collapsing will be anxiously and excitedly watching progress of bitcoin. They stand to benefit the most from it.All small countries will most likely continue to be bullied and belittled by the International Monetary Fund, central banks, G7 countries and other central authorities to not accept bitcoin in return for promises of ""free money, protection and support."" These powerful entities will try everything in their power to prevent Bitcoin’s hope and prosperity from spreading because widespread Bitcoin adoption means their power will be gone forever. Central authorities up to this point have been ruling with fear, lies, fiat slave money and taxation. The U.S. chess pieces will continue to attack Bitcoin with lower Moody ratings and false narratives on countries who adopt her. The IMF could likely stop providing funds to the countries that accept this new technology’s power of hope and sound money. When the world sees the freedom that Bitcoin can offer them from the shackles of their dishonest rulers, many more places will embrace bitcoin. The darkness of the fiat world will be swept away and pure monetary light will shine forth from the beacons of Bitcoin.One of Bitcoin's greatest game theoretic events we may see play out is when the world's energy companies like Exxon Mobil, Saudi Aramco and others start mining bitcoin. This is an inevitability because they can convert their excess energy resources into digital energy. Imagine what a world will look like when Saudi Aramco decides to start denominating their oil prices in satoshis. The reason that this is highly likely, is twofold: The first reason is because of the unfairness of the petrodollar system, as explained in great detail by Alex Gladstein. What better unit of account to choose to replace this system than bitcoin, because no one can manipulate it? Secondly, oil companies will be able to make money through the mining of bitcoin. What oil company does not want to make more money? One of my Bitcoin brothers, @harvardhodl, believes that energy companies will become the new banks of the world. In his own words, ""energy companies will create the bitcoin and have the opportunity to hold it on their balance sheet by subsidizing it through the sale of energy."" I highly regard his opinions because he works in the energy sector and has a pulse on its inner workings. I also highly recommend you listen to his excellent podcast, “Bitcoin for the People.”The U.S. has effectively become the first world power to allow Bitcoin to flourish. Here are the strategic moves that the U.S. has made in this chess game with Bitcoin:All of these moves are a part of Bitcoin game theory. The U.S. will be forced to adopt Bitcoin as a defensive move, otherwise it's world reserve currency status could be lost. All currencies since the advent of fiat have failed and the U.S. dollar will be no different. U.S. senators, governors, presidents and the military will use bitcoin to win elections, attract Bitcoin companies to their states and the nation and fight the currency wars we currently are in. Bitcoin will serve as a defensive and offensive move to allow the U.S. to retain its status as a superpower. But Bitcoin belongs only to the world.Russia might adopt Bitcoin before the U.S. in a strategic move to gain a headstart against their age-old rival. If this happens, in the words of Max Keiser, ""a global hash race will begin,"" and that will start a chain reaction among G7 countries. The capitulation of Russia will be due to the fact that they will understand the correlation between gold and bitcoin, which they have been aggressively buying since the 2008 crisis. Russia has a lot of cheap energy and they will start to mine bitcoin when they realize how much money they can make, given this excess energy.Another Bitcoin game theory event could occur if Turkey decides to purchase bitcoin with it's hyperinflated, worthless fiat currency, the lira. This will be the most important strategic move for a country who has a hyperinflated currency. The beauty of this move is that Turkey will be able to print worthless fiat to buy money that is appreciating at around 170% per year. Essentially they will be mimicking what the U.S. has been doing since 1971 — printing fiat to gain economic prosperity. The only difference in Turkey's case is that they are not invading countries to do this — instead they are just breathing life back into their country's failed economy by becoming huge beneficiaries of the first mover's advantage. Turkey will start a chain reaction among all the other inflation-ridden countries to follow suit and the world will look on with utter disbelief as bitcoin rapidly gets adopted. G7 countries will nervously observe these happenings and start their capitulation even earlier. There will be great dissension during the transition from a fiat world to a Bitcoin world — but this will not be Bitcoin’s fault. Wars may be fought: not necessarily kinetic wars, but maybe even cyber wars. Rulers do not want to allow for Bitcoin. Why would the rulers of the world not desire a world like this? The simple answer is that in the fiat world, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In a Bitcoin world, all people are treated fairly because the money is:Bitcoin's game theory is an elegant, organic, phenomenal and powerful thing to see unfold.This is a guest post by Jeremy Garcia.

2022-02-12T15:00:00-05:00,"Annuities have suffered greatly over time — bitcoin-based annuities, while not probable any time soon, could reinvigorate the industry.An annuity is generally a fixed sum of money paid to someone each year, often defined as payable for the rest of their life. These have typically been purchased from insurance companies upon retirement. A typical annuity quote would be something like, in exchange for every £15 (~US$20.34) of up front cost, I will pay you £1 (~US$1.36) of income each year. These are an important part of the pensions landscape. This is particularly true for personal pensions or defined contribution pensions’, which now make up the majority of pension arrangements in the U.K., where individuals have their own distinct pension “pot” or allocation.Hence, the cost of an annuity can be conceptualized as the cost of retirement, since it forms the link between the pot of money being saved up, and the guaranteed income that can be realized from that. This “cost of retirement” has been vastly increasing in recent years. As the examples at this link illustrate, the income paid in exchange for a £100,000 (~US$135,522) fund for a 65-year-old has decreased from just over £7,000 (~US$9,486) in December 2006 to around £5,100 (~US$6,911) in December 2021. This example is for a simple single-life pension (no dependents pension is paid) with no guarantee period or other complexities. Put another way, if you want a set income payable to you in retirement as an annuity, you now have to save ~25% more than someone retiring at the same age 15 years ago.Moreover, £5,100 (~US$6,911) is the pension payable that does not increase over time. If we want our annuity to increase by 3% per year, our £100,000 (~US$135,522) will currently only pay us a starting annual amount of £3,400 (~US$4,607). If we live for 20 years, this annual amount will have grown to £6,141 (~US$8,322), which helps explain the much lower starting pension. There are two main reasons for the far higher annuity prices in the last 15 years. Firstly, government bond yields have fallen hugely. The 15-year annualized U.K. gilt (government bonds) yield has fallen from roughly 4.7% to 1.15% over this period. Annuity providers price based on this, as they invest the up front annuity cost into U.K. gilts to derive a risk free return on your fund before they have to pay out the income to you each year. A lower gilt yield means a lower return on the underlying investments and hence a worse annuity conversion rate.Secondly, life expectancy has increased over the last 15 years, too. While this should be greeted generally as good news, it will naturally be reflected in annuity pricing by insurers. With that said, the driver for the higher annuity rates as quoted above has been overwhelmingly driven by the first factor — the huge interest rate changes.This is relatively easy to validate for yourself in an annuity calculator, such as this one here. Leave the withdrawal amount blank (to be solved for) and enter interval = ""yearly,"" starting principal = ""100,000,"" annual growth rate = ""1.15%"" and length of annuity = ""22 years,"" and then compare the result to the same inputs but with an interest rate of ""4.7%.""Given these worsening annuity rates, the U.K. media has been somewhat scathing in terms of the value annuities offer. This has coincided (and may have helped drive) with the relatively recent advent of “pensions freedom” rules in the U.K. Put simply, these allow individuals to avoid having to buy an annuity with a defined contribution pension pot and be able to draw it down in their retirement as and when convenient. These freedoms have generally proven popular, and annuity purchases have fallen considerably. However, by drawing down a pot of money, there is considerable danger of drawing down too much early on (the common media refrain was that pensioners would splurge on Lamborghinis immediately on retiring), or, as is closer to reality, drawing down too little. There is also the danger that if not suitably invested, a bear market at the wrong time can severely dent your pension pot. Studies have shown that if this happens early in retirement, alongside having to take out regular income to live on, the fund level may never fully recover even despite a later upswing.The irony remains that the concept of an annuity is still a pretty sound one, as nobody knows how long they are going to live for! Guaranteeing a set level of income in retirement through purchasing an annuity brings considerable peace of mind. However, the public have an innate sense that they are a bad value, and given it's akin at the moment to locking in to an annual return of 1.15% when inflation is far higher, it's hard to disagree. So how could bitcoin come in? Let’s consider that, one day, insurers offer bitcoin annuities. These would pay a regular bitcoin income for life in exchange for a lump sum of bitcoin up front. How would that market differ?My first assumption is that bitcoin offers no risk-free rate, and hence, the insurer would price the annuity rate at an interest rate of 0%. Based on the current pricing and adjusting the interest rate to zero, I'd estimate it would pay 4,545,000 sats per year from a fund of one bitcoin. This is a higher conversion rate than the £3,400 (~US$5,870) annuity increasing at 3% each year (4,545 versus 3,400, from each 100,000 units) which is ultimately priced on a negative real interest rate. For a bitcoin-denominated annuity, we would not require an increasing annuity over time, since we trust the value to hold as a fixed proportion of the overall supply.At this point, there are some obvious questions and criticisms. Firstly, if the insurer is not deriving any return with the bitcoin we pass to it to purchase the annuity, and simply gradually gives it back to us, what’s the point? The answer, of course, is in pooling longevity experience among a large group of individuals. An annuity gives you a guaranteed income for life, and in this sense, it’s still a worthwhile product. Indeed, the original concept of an annuity is an age-old one.Other Bitcoiners may also counter that it’s never worth spending your bitcoin. The concept is more a future one for if bitcoin ever reached the point of a dependable sound money that individuals save and spend in equal measure, and no longer seen as an emerging store of value. And even on a future bitcoin standard, the ebb and flow of life remains, nearly everyone has to save in their younger years to help fund retirement costs in later years. You’re also taking on the credit risk of the insurer, but this has always been the case when purchasing an annuity. Within this point though, here’s the current elephant in the room. Individuals are unlikely to demand a bitcoin annuity product to meet basic income needs in retirement while the purchasing power of bitcoin is so volatile in fiat terms.To conclude, in the much longer term, a less volatile bitcoin price in the future could breathe new life into the concept of an annuity, both priced in bitcoin and paying out bitcoin. For the time being, annuities will likely remain unpopular as they offer poor value with government bond yields so low.

2022-02-11T21:30:00-05:00,"We look to be headed toward a trend of increased BTC holder accumulation following a local bitcoin price top.The below is from a recent edition of the Deep Dive, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.A key on-chain metric that we’ve discussed before, and that we will cover today, is the Realized HODL (RHODL) Ratio. The ratio uses realized cap HODL waves, which takes the original HODL Wave metric and weights the UTXOs in each age band by their realized price. Specifically the Realized HODL Ratio uses the one-week and the one-to-two-years Realized Cap HODL Age bands.For a more in-depth overview of this metric, check out The Daily Dive: HODL Waves And Realized HODL Ratio. By using this metric, we can better understand what’s happening with younger coins versus older coins. As younger coins become more dominant and the ratio rises, long-term holders hold less of the realized market value. As the ratio falls, long-term holders hold more market-realized value compared to younger coins. An overheated market would show much higher younger coin dominance.In the previous bitcoin tops in 2021, we didn’t see the rise of younger coins relative to older coins like previous cycles. We saw the RHODL Ratio rise throughout the year, but it never became heated or overheated like the 2016 cycle. This can be due to a changing cycle, a more maturing market or the fact that we didn’t see the significant wave of new demand, younger coin buying, seen in past cycles.The bitcoin price, weighted by the RHODL ratioOver the last month, we’ve seen a significant increase in the HODL Waves and Realized Cap HODL Waves one-to-two-years age bands. More coins are aging into this band and are taking up more economic weight in the RHODL Ratio calculation as more long-term held supply comes into the market. As a result, the RHODL Ratio is right around its 50th percentile inbetween a neutral and cooled state.Historically, we’ve seen the one-to-two-years age band peak around 50% of supply, while it’s currently at 12.93%. We look to be headed into a trend of increased holder accumulation post a local bitcoin price top. As accumulation continues and older coins age in, the RHODL Ratio falls and makes bitcoin a more attractive historical buy.Realized cap HODL waves for one to two years, and one week to one month"
2022-02-11T20:30:00-05:00,"Using Blockstream Satellite, this guide demonstrates how to mine bitcoin by yourself without placing trust in a pool.A version of this article was originally published on Medium.In light of some recent awesome events in the Bitcoin mining sphere, I was inspired to set up my own small, four million hashes per second (MH/s) solo mining operation and see how I could improve it. A couple of the aspects that I thought could use some work are related to connectivity and in making my setup the most “pure” in the sense of decentralization and trustlessness.So, I initially began digging into how exactly one solo mines in today’s exceedingly industrialized mining world. I’m not interested in pay-per-share pooled mining, since that drains any of the fun of solo mining, and introduces some trust. I want to directly contribute unadulterated hash rate security to the Bitcoin network.Note: I am assuming the reader knows that solo mining is incredibly difficult and you are more than likely to never actually generate a block. Just full disclosure here. Having said that…Years ago, solo mining required setting up a full, industrial-grade pool that was designed for thousands of remote individual miners pooling their hash rates together. I remember trying to set one up either using the Eligius code or one of the other not-as-well-known pool projects on GitHub and it was difficult to get all of the individual software components working. Knowing this, let’s just say I wasn’t getting my hopes up that mining solo was any easier today.CK Pool has its own “solo” counterpart (which, I honestly love that this exists), and it’s a sort of pseudo-solo mining pool where individual miners get 98% of the block reward (paying a 2% pool fee) when they generate a block and the other pool participants get 0%. Contrast this with typical pooled mining where all hash rate contributors get a piece of the block reward. The Solo CK Pool is great, but ultimately using the pool introduces some trust that shouldn’t exist in a pure solo mining setup. There is some incompatibility with the latest Bitcoin Core version and the most recent CK Pool code as well, based upon my attempt at using it for this mining setup.After scouring DuckDuckGo and GitHub issues, I stumbled upon BFGMiner’s ability to communicate with a local bitcoind for the purposes of solo mining(!). I had no idea this functionality existed since BFGMiner was typically used for interfacing with GPUs or ASIC hardware while mining.Note: CGMiner also has this functionality. Thanks Con!So, with this new BFGMiner knowledge, we can eliminate any difficult-to-set-up pool software, or any trusted pool, and only rely on BFGMiner and a Bitcoin Core full node. This fits the bill for my purist solo mining configuration.This leaves the improvements to connectivity. How this can be bolstered is by using Blockstream Satellite to supplement the set of peers my node uses while my ISP is functioning, and as a failover in the event my ISP gets flaky and drops my connection. This way, my mining hardware can know what block is the latest block to build on and no effort is wasted.An area of research is block egress, however. Options do exist like Starlink or Iridium that can be used for broadcasting a newly-found block. Starlink is probably overkill cost-wise due to the likelihood of actually solo mining a block, and blocks themselves being relatively small in size. But it is a good option. SMS is another option that I will explore in future blog posts.Guide assumes Ubuntu 20.04. Warning: some compiling is necessary.It’s actually really easy now. There isn’t any need to set up a full-blown mining pool anymore. BFGMiner can handle everything we need. So let’s get everything set up.Follow Blockstream’s excellent guide for putting together a satellite antenna, aligning it and installing all of the necessary software to start receiving Bitcoin data via geosynchronous satellite.Install blocksat-cli and Bitcoin Satellite, the patched Bitcoin Core node that Blockstream maintains for satellite connectivity.BFGMiner is GPU/ASIC mining software that also supports solo mining using a local bitcoind!This software will bridge our mining hardware to our local satellite Bitcoin node.$ git clone https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer && cd bfgminerFor Ubuntu, all you need to do is install the dependencies and then build normally.$ sudo apt install automake autoconf libtool pkg-config libcurl4-gnutls-dev libjansson-dev uthash-devThen build it.$ ./autogen.sh$ ./configure$ makeWith your bitcoind synced and receiving data via satellite (debug.log should output bitrate data if successfully receiving), point BFGMiner to your local node. Make sure to set server=1 and rpcuser=user rpcpassword=pass in bitcoin.conf$ ./bfgminer -T -D -P -o '127.0.0.1:8332' -O user:pass --stratum-port 3334 --generate-to <your address>This will tell BFGMiner to pull data from your node and which port to listen on for stratum miners (basically all modern ASICs use stratum).Once BFGminer is running, simply point your ASIC hardware to the IP address your bitcoind and BFGMiner are running on (port 3334) instead of a normal mining pool like Slush Pool. You should begin to start seeing low difficulty shares being submitted by the mining hardware in the BFGminer console output. That’s it! You’re solo mining like a boss and have a backup blockchain data source via geosynchronous satellite. How awesome is that?

2022-02-11T19:00:00-05:00,"What is the current setting of nation-state monetary dependency, and where could Bitcoin take us?Let us consider the nations of the world, their standing as monetary powers, as followers, victims, and outcasts. How will these nations use Bitcoin strategically?These are countries with massive sway over others. Other nations hold their currency as foreign reserves. They control the primary unit of account in global trade. When they print money they earn “seigniorage” profits, not just from their domestic population, but from the many foreigners holding their currency.There’s only one true monetary hegemony today: the United States. To some degree the eurozone, and to an even lesser degree, Japan and China, are partial monetary hegemons. Their currencies are held as foreign reserves in smaller amounts. But primarily the U.S. is the overwhelmingly dominant power; it has the world reserve currency and the deepest and safest markets. It controls the numeraire for world savings and trade. It controls the financial infrastructure used in international payments: the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (aka SWIFT).Minor players are countries that do have their own currency and can extract some degree of seigniorage profit from the issuing of more currency. But unlike the full-fledged monetary hegemon countries, their currencies are not really held by foreigners. Thus the profits of printing money are extracted solely from the domestic population, with little external impact. Turkey, Mexico, and indeed most large nations are minor players by this definition.Some countries are dependent on the currency of another, typically one of the monetary hegemon countries. These countries are at the whim of the hegemon. They do not receive the profits of seigniorage. Indeed, as holders of the money of a monetary hegemon, they pay the costs of inflation without receiving any of the benefits, since typically printed money is spent domestically. Nations pegged to the dollar, or using the dollar or euro as legal tender are effectively vassal states. The African CFA currency unions are in this way vassals of the eurozone. Other nations, such as Saudi Arabia, are pegged to the U.S. dollar, and because the U.S. dollar constitutes a dominant fraction of world currency reserves, most countries at least partially bear the cost of U.S. seigniorage.Image sourceBeing a vassal means surrendering the ability to extract seigniorage, and indeed, to instead offer that value up to another power. Frequently states assume vassal status because either A) they tried to be minor players but entirely lost credibility or B) they have some other strategic reason to request protection from the U.S. or eurozone (hegemons).Some nations are entirely shunned by the monetary hegemon countries. Iran is completely disconnected from the SWIFT network, denying it access to U.S. dollar-based financial rails. North Korea and Cuba are in a similar situation. As with being a vassal, exclusion is not binary. Financial sanctions have been levied against many countries and individuals to different degrees. Russia is a minor player that is in a state of partial exclusion.Some nations may not be currently excluded, but may expect to be in the future. Russia is currently facing U.S. sanctions over the Russo-Ukrainian crisis. If conditions deteriorate, Russia can expect to be ejected from the SWIFT system: a dramatic escalation of its excluded status. As a result, Russia is preparing now for exclusion by reducing dollar holdings, acquiring gold, and setting up trade deals denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. To be a fully independent world power, a nation must prepare to be resilient in the face of financial exclusion from the U.S. Exclusion is the extension of war to the monetary realm: A country that cannot survive exclusion is not a power that can act independently.Let us examine how each group is likely to view Bitcoin, in reverse order.Excluded nations are likely to embrace Bitcoin, probably quite soon. Bitcoin solves an enormous problem for them; how to transmit value in the face of hostile global institutions. Bitcoin was explicitly designed to be hardened against attack from powerful nation-states, and can therefore be trusted by states like Iran. This is why other cryptocurrencies likely would not be suitable; they are not decentralized enough to survive intense scrutiny from the monetary hegemons. North Korea cannot realistically hold large amounts of value in ETH or SOL because the U.S. would likely influence those protocols to confiscate that value. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is so hard to change; a country like Iran could openly acquire it, and the U.S. would be effectively powerless to confiscate it or interfere in their ability to transactExcluded nations moving value the hard way. (Source: Bloomberg)In 2020 Venezuela needed to pay Iran for assistance in restarting its ailing oil sector. Since both nations are sanctioned, their solution was to actually fly physical gold bars from Caracas to Tehran. This was quite onerous. A much better way for these nations to transact would be via bitcoin, as no trust is needed between parties, and the neutral, apolitical nature of Bitcoin is extremely appealing. Even for shunned nations, using the ruble or the yuan isn’t particularly appealing, as no one wants to trust Russia or China with their monetary unit either. No, something independent of any nation is needed because financial settlement between nations is inherently low-trust. In a competitive global environment, powers are wary of each other; the fate of one’s savings cannot rely on trusting someone else. So neutral money is very desirable. Gold is neutral, but far more costly and inconvenient than bitcoin to transfer.Excluded nations are likely to embrace Bitcoin quite soon. The more eagerly the U.S. and the eurozone wield the cudgel of financial sanctions, the faster they will drive excluded nations to Bitcoin as a workaround. These are not nations with a particular ideological attraction to Bitcoin. Basically all of them are brutal dictatorships: no friends of liberty. Instead of embracing Bitcoin because they love its libertarian roots, they will be driven to use it because they are barred from the traditional alternatives. The speed with which this happens is entirely a function of how much financial sanctions are applied by the hegemons.We are already seeing this trend take place. Dictators like Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Erdogan are rumored to be paying close attention to cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin would interfere with their ability to extract seigniorage rents from their domestic populations, they would be enabling units of value in international exchange if relations with the West deteriorate further. A scheme could arise whereby local currencies are enforced on the domestic populations, but bitcoin is used as an international settlement tool between nation-states. This would mirror the dual-currency scheme of the U.S.S.R. and other Soviet bloc countries, in which a hard currency is used for foreign trade, but local people are forced to use a weaker, far less hard form. From a dictator’s perspective, this is convenient; you can trade with foreigners who will not accept your local fiat, but preserve the ability to extract local seigniorage rents. Such a dual-tier system could easily arise in authoritarian states like Turkey, Iran, Russia, etc, with bitcoin as the hard, externally-facing money.As a vassal, Bitcoin is an exit opportunity. You are paying seigniorage costs to your overlord. They are capturing value from you. Adopting Bitcoin is a way to break free and establish independence. Unlike a large country, a vassal probably cannot set up a global financial infrastructure alone. But conveniently, the Bitcoin network is already up and running. New entrants can simply sign up and inherit that global value transmission system.Adopting Bitcoin means you no longer pay the cost of the debasement of the overlord’s money. But they are not likely to be happy about that. El Salvador was previously a vassal state to the U.S. in this sense, since its legal tender was the U.S. dollar. To be clear, the dollar is still legal tender in El Salvador, but it coexists with bitcoin, which makes up an increasing fraction of its reserves. El Salvador now benefits from the hardness of bitcoin; it has reduced the ongoing debasement cost inherent with holding U.S. dollar reserves.However, breaking free of one’s overlord is not without costs. The U.S., and to a lesser extent the eurozone, are extremely powerful and influential and can punish dissent. For its act of rebellious independence, El Salvador earned condemnation from the U.S. and the IMF. Nations that need U.S. support to survive will not discard vassal status anytime soon. Countries like Taiwan and Poland that have strategic reasons to desire friendship with the U.S., are unlikely to drop their dollar reserves. Their subservience to U.S. and eurozone monetary hegemony is calculated and fully rational based on their situations. But each vassal will perform its own calculation, asking, “Am I getting enough from the hegemon to justify the seigniorage rents I pay?” The greater those rents, i.e., the greater the monetary debasement in the U.S. and eurozone, the more stress that will be imposed on that relationship. If the dollar’s depreciation accelerated, many U.S. dollar reserve holders could question their allegiance and potentially dump dollars.Minor players are caught midway between vassals and hegemons. They enjoy some seigniorage, so are probably reluctant to lose that income by going full Bitcoin. But the advantages of Bitcoin as savings technology will be clear. I don’t see a clear story. Probably some nations will try the two-tier domestic/foreign currency approach, in which the state tries to monopolize access to bitcoin, as in the U.S.SR. I do not believe this will actually work, as citizens can’t be prevented from accessing bitcoin as they were with 20th century money.The most likely scenario is that minor players are simply broken. Their currencies are manifestly less desirable than those of the hegemons, let alone bitcoin. Bitcoin’s existence serves as an escape option for the populace. They shall take that option and minor players have no real choice.The U.S. and the eurozone have the most to lose from the adoption of Bitcoin by other countries. Their sanctions will no longer have teeth. Their inflation will not be so easily exported abroad. Instead money printing will reverberate domestically with low latency. The seigniorage profits of the dollar play a large role in funding U.S. power. Take that away and the hegemon’s power is reduced materially, not just in terms of financial influence, but militarily and diplomatically as well. This could have significant global consequences, akin to the diminution of the British pound after World War II. The debasement and global abandonment of the pound signaled the end of the U.K. as a monetary hegemon. This went hand-in-hand with reduced influence overseas. Previously the U.K. government had been able to convince other peoples to accept their money on preferential terms, usually through moral suasion and influence. British colonies held pounds as reserves even when other countries preferred hard gold or safer dollars. As Britain lost its hegemony status, it had to bear the full brunt of maintaining overseas colonies alone, and could not.The Delian League, circa 470 BC. Athens as the U.S. and the League as dollar holders.Source: WikipediaU.S. global influence could suffer a fate similar to that of Britain’s empire if it loses hegemony in money. The U.S. is still the world’s largest economy, but its power is augmented through the seigniorage rents extracted from all dollar holders worldwide. This is an enormous amount of value. It should be thought of as a tax on vassals in an unequal alliance, not unlike the Delian League of ancient Athens. A coalition of tributaries is led by an overlord. There is some ostensible purpose of self-defense, but in reality each subject nation pays a tax to the leader of the alliance. These are notionally independent states, but they are effectively not independent and are expected to contribute financially. The U.S. does the same, except indirectly through the seigniorage tax rather than through explicit tribute. But it amounts to the same. It is thus no surprise that U.S. allies are expected to hold dollars and to price things in dollars. And similarly, reneging on the dollar, or de-dollarization, is viewed by the U.S. as tantamount to disloyalty and sedition.So the U.S. and eurozone states will view Bitcoin as a serious threat. Yet the majority of bitcoin wealth will likely be held by citizens in those countries. We can expect the same perception of disloyalty to extend to domestic bitcoin holders. We have seen President Erdogan urge Turks to turn in dollars and gold for local liras, as an expression of patriotism. Similarly, British citizens were urged to turn in their gold for fiat notes during World War I and onwards. In the U.S. it was mandated by executive order. Calls to patriotism, coercion, and other measures will be made to persuade citizens to surrender bitcoin to the state. The effectiveness of these measures is likely to be muted, as prying bitcoin from rationally-incentivized holders will be extremely difficult. Similar coercive measures have been attempted in nearly all hyper-inflationary states in history, and they usually failed. In Weimar Germany there were hapless efforts to convince or force citizens to surrender hard foreign currency. Despite irregular successes, these efforts were hopeless in the long run.The hegemons will resist an alternative to their power. They will be the last to fall. Rather than suffering from external forces, probably the hegemons will be gobbled up from the inside as domestic citizens turn to bitcoin to avoid hyperinflation, as with the minor players, just later.Unlike gold, bitcoin is ascending to world reserve currency status in full view. We get to watch its ascent, its gyrations, and its gradual normalization. It is volatile precisely because the realization of bitcoin’s suitability as savings technology spreads unevenly. A gradual awareness grows around the world over the course of years. That awareness first grows among mere individuals, but reaches a tipping point and erupts at the level of entire countries. Some countries will arrive at the conclusion before others. El Salvador was very early. But there will be a second and a third and a fourth, spaced out perhaps by years. What does this process look like?The dawning awareness of Bitcoin’s strategic role will lead to secret accumulation by nations. This is probably underway already. As a central bank or national leader, it makes sense to quietly accumulate bitcoin as a hedge, but without much fanfare. If you are a vassal nation you must acquire them secretly to avoid angering the hegemon. If you are a hegemon, you must do so secretly to avoid undermining one’s own hegemonic money. Probably for this reason the hegemons will acquire much less bitcoin than they ought. Like a non-innovating company resting on its laurels, the U.S. and eurozone do not want to disrupt their own money-maker, even if it is doomed.Accumulation by the non-hegemonic nations could accelerate very quickly. As states become aware of other’s accumulation, it could become an exponentially intensifying race. Probably a full bitcoin cycle, bubble and collapse will someday be entirely driven by nation-state buying.A nation-state could apply the Michael Saylor strategy, simply printing money to buy bitcoin. In the recent past China kept its currency intentionally weak to acquire hard foreign reserves, weaken its own currency, and to stimulate exports. Switzerland has printed Swiss francs to buy foreign assets like equities. A similar dynamic could apply to bitcoin; print one’s own currency to acquire it. For a nation, this is a smart trade. The very same trick that Saylor applied with MicroStrategy, issuing low-rate long-term debt to fund bitcoin purchases, could be applied at a much greater scale by nations. It is simple; produce something whose issuance you control to acquire that which no one controls.I am sure that the strategic repercussions of Bitcoin have not been properly considered, by me or others. It is worth thinking further on the long-term geopolitical effects of hard, apolitical, and neutral money. Nations will use bitcoin as a weapon, fight it, and probably succumb to it.This is a guest post by Andrew Barisser.

But when a peaceful protest gets its funds frozen by the state, the need for such an icon of the working class comes to light. The entire world has turned its eyes to Ottawa with an incredible showing of peace, love and human rights taking to the streets amongst the big rigs and their captains. The government, working with the police, pressured private companies and local banks to prevent funds being received, accessed and even distributed, leading to the need for an open, decentralized monetary platform. This is a story about many working people coming together and standing up to systems that were built to keep them down; financial freedom is often misunderstood, but nevertheless a fundamental human right. Thus, this is also a Bitcoin story, and one of open networks heeding the calls that centralized, closed networks have long stopped answering.

The upgrade introduced a new output type, Pay to Taproot (P2TR), using the new Bech32m address format and allowing bitcoin spending to look the same regardless of whether it involves a simple transaction, a more complex multisig one, or a Lightning Network-related transaction.According to Bitcoin Optech newsletter issue 154, Bech32m is slightly different from its predecessor, Bech32, as it changes the “0x01” constant in the checksum function for “0x2bc830a3.”“BitMEX is proud to use the latest Bitcoin technology, to provide better features and lower fees for our users,” per the statement.The more complex the spending conditions, the more the user can save in transaction fees by using Taproot as the new address type makes nearly any transaction look like a simple, single-signature one. The upgrade also enables larger and more complex operations to be deployed on Bitcoin that were previously unfeasible or almost impossible.BitMEX took a step in the right direction by enabling the latest Bitcoin functionality to its users as most of the possibilities unlocked by Taproot can only be actualized once a considerable chunk of the network starts using the upgrade.Popular mobile financial platform and broker Cash App added support to Taproot in December."
2022-02-11T13:30:43-05:00,"State Rep.

Christofanelli said in a statement. “This industry has great potential to enhance Missouri’s push to create greater economic and political freedom and I hope to advance this legislation and further proposals over the next few years.”“Rep. Christofanelli's leadership in Missouri will put our state at the forefront of returning America to a sound monetary policy, and serve as an example for what we should do in Congress,” Fourth Congressional District candidate Taylor Burks said in a statement.If enacted, House Bill 2672 would differentiate “digital assets” among three distinct categories according to each asset’s purpose.According to the bill, a digital asset would be classified as a “virtual currency” if used “as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value” and not recognized as legal tender in the United States. Only virtual currencies would receive the tax exemption.A “digital security,” as per the bill’s text, would be any digital asset that “constitutes a security, as defined under section 409.1-102, but shall exclude digital consumer assets and virtual currency.”The third category digital assets could fall into is “open blockchain tokens,” a digital unit created in a digital ledger or database, including blockchains, for the “verification or collection of a specified number of transactions” of that digital ledger or database. The token must also be capable of being transferred “without an intermediary or custodian of value,” the bill said. An open blockchain token whose predominant purpose is “consumptive” rather than a financial investment could be recognized as “intangible digital property.”Developers or sellers seeking to issue an open blockchain token would need to file a notice of intent with the secretary of state and pay $1,000 in fees.

What was happening in this suburb of Austin was not motivated by “nUmBeR gO uP,” or “wen lambo.” The only conversations that could be heard were exchanges of real value: Discussions on how we can all improve our mining operations and facilities, educational materials, better strategies for speaking to those who simply do not possess the time to wander down the rabbit hole like we have and, of course, methods of better protecting the hardware that secures this goliath of a computing network.It was Scott’s Mining Conference 2022, and below you’ll find the space’s most significant takeaways.

Bitcoin’s miners mean work, and have no intention of wasting daylight.On the morning of day one of Scott’s Mining Conference, the air was filled with an electricity of excitement from the crowd preparing to stampede the Riot bitcoin mining facility, which was being toured as part of the conference agenda. Real electricity was flowing just a few yards away as the discussion and demonstration panel, led by ASIC Master out of Chicago, was preparing to kick off. Starting off the morning light with the basics of individual ASIC setup, the representatives of Master did the group a service by taking an easing-in approach to the morning, saving the more intense discussions around the tricks of the trade behind board repairs and strategies that will save mining operations oodles, for later. Between divulging insights on capital and opportunity costs of the ASIC repair business, ASIC Master did a stellar job of placing the audience and the mining operators first.Meanwhile, Digital Shovel was sparking off a buzz of its own (that would end up igniting a conflagration that spread aggressively throughout day two) within the exposition hall of Kalahari Resorts & Conventions, the main site of the conference. The source of the excitement, that had a conference full of nerds, blue collar workers and technologists brimming with excitement and energy? I am not skilled in this area so prepare for an effective butchering, but what the brains over at Digital Shovel have done is to have seemingly made life for miners dramatically improved. And not just by providing its Pods (which allow for speedy deployment of anywhere from 88 to more than 100 miners per pod, depending on miner model), but by explaining how Digital Shovel has incorporated an individual circuit transformer that acts similarly to power distribution units, allowing for monitoring on a per-bay basis. Bringing the first day to a wrap, the event culminated with a hearty dinner and bowling tournament where bowlers competed for a prize paid out in bitcoin, naturally. Still, there was seemingly little that could be done to curb the excitement of the bitcoiners, miners, manufacturers and oil and gas operators into the evening. As conversations all directed towards the prospects of day two, particularly with speculations of whether MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor would be tuning-in remotely or in-person, there was shared excitement over potential insight into the progress of political developments coming from an upcoming panel led by D.C. insider Amanda Cavaleri and Major League Baseball Pitcher turned Bitcoin advocate C.J. Wilson, as well as inputs on the environment of mining operations from the likes of Rhodium Enterprises CEO Nathan Nichols and value investor Mike Alfred. Needless to say, day two was going to be jam packed, and as day one was approaching a wrap, the energy of the evening was redirected to getting ample sleep in order to survive the high-octane schedule that was fast-approaching at the break of tomorrow’s sunrise.The morning’s remarks from our hosts, Scott Offord, Shanon Squires and Brad James, ended effectively feeling like a team meeting that culminated in a “ready… break!” sensation. Attendees broke out from the mainstage hall like a can of biscuits, and coffee-fueled life was sparked back into the halls of the northernmost wing of Kalahari Resorts. The panel on “Transcending The Political Divide” proved to be the apple of the eyes of many attendees to kickstart the morning, as operators, investors, manufacturers and educators all keyed in to hear how progress was going around a political issue that, while heavily publicized (especially as of late), is very much still clouded in mystery and lacking in understanding. Cavaleri expressed the complexity of the political landscape, noting particulars in what is admissible in the lobbying world, as well as a providing many kernels of wisdom and hope.“We as Bitcoiners need an injection of wisdom and reflection — to not fall into the low time preference, controversial algorithmic farming approach to political engagement,” she said. “So that we can reach those beneficial outcomes while avoiding over regulation, versus just making noise.”This was followed by one particular bit of patriotism that shed some light on the positive ground that is being gained with regards to Bitcoin’s bipartisanship.“... but there’s two things that are resonating with both sides [of the aisle]: Freedom and equality. Which is America,” Caveleri added.Then, Wilson dropped a real nugget of value for those looking to improve their approaches to orange-pilling individuals — whether they be politicians or parents.“We as Bitcoiners need to approach the education process for legislators like we do when teaching an individual how to play baseball,” he said. “We have to start with tee-ball first. Making the key points easy to see, easy to acknowledge and as easy to grasp as possible… Then education can be iterated and pushed further.” As hallway meetings and lobbycon introductions continued to catalyze and snowball, time stopped following lunch. All eyes turned to the mainstage hall, crowded with eager ears intent on hearing remarks from Saylor as he was to be interviewed by HODLujah’s John Fakhoury. Saylor did not disappoint, as discussion continued, he gradually let his Bitcoin pleb side really start to shine through. Echoing the talking points of many a Twitter personality, he expressed concern and frustration with the dynamics at play of poor information that may (or may not be) receiving guidance from those with misaligned incentives toward an industry that is aiming to provide society with radical improvements upon efficiency, value and truth. Following Saylor, I managed to meander my way back to the main stage where Bitcoin author and influencer Jason Williams and Ancova Founder Max Gagliardi shared discussion and insights around clever strategies for providing energy that are essentially only made feasible after bitcoin mining. This not only provides a service via energy generation, but also provides opportunities that yield energy and have much more positive impacts on the environment. Fellow pleb and popular Pleb Net representative D++ held an interactive workshop which, while providing a breakdown of what SHA-256 encryption means, also single-handedly provided the audience a hands-on experience of how miners operate. By providing a game that had players attempt to guess a hash entirely by random with the audience, D++ effectively expressed the beauty of the difficulty adjustment within bitcoin mining, as well as its effectiveness. You could not only hear, but you could feel the collective “a ha” that washed over the audience and participants. As if all of these events weren’t energetic enough, the hosts capped off the conference with an appearance from DJ Paul Oakenfold held in the onsite event center, where dinner and libations were joyously consumed and followed by a clustering of conversations around Bitcoiner politics, philosophy and game theory, all centered around the many bonfires throughout the resort grounds.

2022-02-11T09:58:14-05:00,"Watch This Episode On YouTubeListen To This Episode:In this episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s ""Fed Watch,"" we got an update on the European Central Bank (ECB), used a candy to make the Bank of Japan interesting and we talked about recent troubles with BlockFi and bitcoin lending.""Fed Watch"" is a podcast for people interested in central bank current events. Bitcoin will consume central banks one day, so understanding and documenting how that is happening is where this show lives.European inflation numbers for January 2022 came out this week, and set another Euro-era record at 5.1%, up from 5.0% in December. This consumer price increase of 5.1% must be put in context of the worst energy and supply chain crisis in two generations. The price of natural gas and electricity have exploded in Europe, which has a trickle-down effect on most prices in the economy. These price increases are not a direct side effect of money printing, they are a direct effect of the pandemic response of nearly shutting down the global economy for two years.We attempted to play the below two-minute clip of President Lagarde speaking about inflation, but the audio on the live stream wasn’t set up properly. You can also find the full length press conference here.I spent some time on the podcast comparing the highly-produced press conference style of the ECB to that of the Federal Reserve. ECB President Christine Lagarde appears to have a checklist of special interest groups that she must mention and placate. It strikes me as a political process, whereas Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell strikes me as much more concerned about the economics.It is a central part of the Federal Reserve to stay fiercely independent from politics, as seen in the Sarah Bloom Raskin interview in front of the Senate Banking Committee. Her progressive views were on trial, and they wanted to make sure she wouldn’t be bringing her politics to a job at the Fed. The European Central Bank, on the other hand, conflates politics as part of its mandate.In the press conference, Lagarde said the bank would let its quantitative easing (QE) programs run their course and finish up in late March to early April. That was not surprising. However, what did surprise the market was the fact that Lagarde would not repeat her statement from December’s press conference where she said the ECB would not raise rates in 2022.The reason the market didn’t like this seemingly small detail is because it makes the ECB appear capricious. Compared to Powell, where he made his pivot and doubled down on it later, Lagarde does not give the sense of being confident in her opinions or evaluation of the economy. I attribute this to the overly-politicized ECB, by the way. It is unable to focus on a clear mandate, because its policy is being pulled in political directions.This is where I tied all these things back to bitcoin. Credit spreads in Europe have been spiking recently. France’s five-year credit default swap (CDS) is priced at 20, Italy's at 103, Spain's 40 and Greece's at 127. As the spread between these CDS contracts widens, investors face an increasing implied redenomination risk (with a possibility of an exit from the euro).Over the last couple of weeks, as these CDS spreads have increased, so has the price of bitcoin. Greg Foss talked about this when he came on ""Fed Watch"" a couple of months ago. As sound money without counterparty risk, bitcoin should correlate with CDS prices and the redenomination risk in Europe.I’ll be watching these prices closely for any correlation in the coming months, but it is a good sign for bitcoin that it performed positively as stresses in Europe have increased this week.The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has been the most consistent over the last few decades. It has done the most QE by far of any central bank, yet it struggles with low growth, low inflation, low interest rates (these things always go together by the way, as I wrote here).After three decades of ultra-low inflation, I read a story about Umaibo, a snack item in Japan, that has been selling for 10 yen a piece for 40 years, but is raising their price now to 12 yen. Gasp, the horror.Some people think this development, along with the recent creeping up of the 10-year Japanese Government Bond rate to 21 basis points (BPS) is a sign that inflation might be coming to Japan, too.I highly doubt it. The amount of QE the BOJ has done over the last 20 years puts the Federal Reserve to shame, and is not stimulus. Long-term QE actually hangs over the economy as a wet blanket on any growth. Just compare the three major central banks — the Fed, the ECB and the BOJ. Their CPI inflation rates are in opposite order to the ranking of the central bank balance sheet as a percent of GDP. The more QE a central bank does, the lower the CPI inflation rate.We ended the show this week by talking about the nascent bitcoin credit market. A central player in this ecosystem is BlockFi, and it has been at the center of a growing scandal in bitcoin.A post on the company's own subreddit went viral. In the post, an individual relates that BlockFi called in his loan due to the bitcoin he used having a history of mixing. It is a very bad sign for many BlockFi customers, who probably mix their coins as part of a routine in good financial hygiene.Another development this week is the raising of minimum withdrawal limits from BlockFi. Again, via the company’s subreddit:“At this time we are only supporting wire withdrawals of $50,000 USD or more for US-based clients, or $5,000 USD for international. Since we don't support ACH withdrawals for international clients at this time, I might recommend withdrawing to a different platform/exchange that can. This is specifically why we offer 1 stablecoin (plus BTC or LTC) withdrawal per month.”–u/Brandon_BlockFi, Community ManagerLastly, BlockFi has downgraded its interest terms to very low levels. The new tier one (less than 0.1 BTC) offers 4.5%. However, if you were to have the over-the-minimum-withdrawal amount of $50,000, you’d be in tier three (more than 0.35 BTC), earning only 0.1% on your bitcoin.Something is very fishy about what is going on at BlockFi. There are alternatives in the bitcoin ecosystem. Ledn is one, Hodl Hodl is another. Be very careful with bitcoin lending."

2022-02-10T21:30:00-05:00,"Bitcoin, an open-source monetary system, can supercharge open-source development projects and vice versa.The below is a direct excerpt of Marty's Bent Issue #1160: ""Open source money enhancing open source code."" Sign up for the newsletter here.via Ten31via Ten31Here's a great piece from Grant Gilliam, someone I am proud to call a friend and business partner at Ten31. In it, Grant dives into the ways in which Bitcoin, an open source monetary system, can supercharge open source development projects in the space and vice versa.Many underestimate the power of open source software and its ability to enable incredible things. For decades open source software projects have struggled to monetize. Many have done it successfully, but never without the need to get really creative or getting bought out by a big corporation that was leveraging the software. Due to the nature of the protocol's monetary applications Bitcoin is proving that there are new ways for open source projects to monetize, which highlights Bitcoin's utility, strengthens projects leveraging it, and puts a positive feedback loop in motion that leads to the Bitcoin protocol, companies, and critical infrastructure massively benefiting from each other.A great example of this flywheel in motion is Podcasting 2.0, which leverages two open source protocols in RSS and Bitcoin, and enables entrepreneurs building open source products on the open source Podcasting 2.0 projects to easily monetize their products. Podcasters simply include their Lightning Network public address in the value block embedded in the RSS feed for their podcasts, their listeners are then able to stream them sats over the Lightning Network using their preferred Podcasting 2.0 application, and as they do that they are automatically able to send a small percentage of the sats they are streaming to that Podcasting 2.0 app to help that app monetize. Open source apps leveraging open source protocols to allow content creators and entrepreneurs to monetize in a self sovereign fashion. It's a beautiful thing.There are many other examples of this type of beautiful feedback loop too. Unchained Capital offers a multisig service to people that allows them to engage in collaborative custody, loan products that give them visibility to their loan collateral without having full control of it over the course of their loan, and an IRA product that allows individuals to hold their own keys. Unchained, recognizing the value they've received from leveraging Bitcoin's open source protocol, has decided to give back to the protocol and its users by open sourcing its multisig solution via Caravan, which allows individuals to build these type of products for themselves if they want. They bank on many people forgoing that ability to engage with the expertise that Unchained has in this particular area.Another example of the beautiful open source feedback loop described by Grant is Samourai Wallet, which provides open source privacy tools for bitcoiners. Samourai Wallet is open source, and they benefit from the open source nature of Bitcoin, yet they are also able to leverage their open source project and Bitcoin to provide revenue by offering coordination services for the CoinJoin tools they build.One last example that I'll mention here is something we're building at TFTC that leverages Ghost, an open source content management, and the Bitcoin Protocol/ Lightning Network Protocol stack to enable sovereign monetization of content. Here's a demo of what we've built.This functionality will enable us to monetize this newsletter (which will be transitioning away from MailChimp and to Ghost very soon) in a peer-to-peer self sovereign fashion via the Lightning Network. And who knows, maybe we'll be able to convince Ghost to spin up a Lightning node so that we can send them a small percentage of the revenue we bring in via this product to help them monetize the continued build out of their open source project.Open source fueling open source. It's a beautiful thing. And it is only a matter of time before more and more people begin to realize this."
2022-02-10T18:00:00-05:00,"While many accept that the process of hyperbitcoinization is a given, we shouldn’t be so ready to revel in our victory.Bitcoiners are optimists.When Satoshi Nakamoto wrote and released the first code that began the Bitcoin experiment, it was an inherently optimistic act in response to the economic and monetary turbulence referenced in the genesis block.Satoshi was a cypherpunk, a group which envisioned shaping a better future through deliberate technological innovation, particularly in regards to software.Cypherpunks write code.By leveraging software, a single individual could have an outsized impact on the world and future societal outcomes. Unfortunately, however, this optimism has more recently been warped beyond recognition and become detached from the focus on actual progressive technical development.I mean to highlight and push back on this attitude of inevitability, which stands in stark contrast to Bitcoin’s original practical optimism. Two prominent examples come to mind: PlanB’s “stock-to-flow” (S2F) model and Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy and rhetoric.In PlanB’s infamous price projection model S2F, the path to bitcoin’s dominance is charted, assured and deterministic. Sure, the author never claims its absolute precision. After all, all intellectually honest parties will agree volatility is unavoidable in bootstrapping a new monetary system from zero. But the popular attitude around S2F' and all similar models is clear:“Number goes up.”It’s not a mystery why. With this idea as a guiding star there’s nothing to do but sit around, stack sats with any available cash flow, and wait for the prideful moment you can tell everyone, “I told you so.” The lure of inevitability is easy, simple and seductive.While Michael Saylor has been vocally critical of the S2F model, he seems to mirror the same underlying attitude of assumed inevitability. Saylor and his firm, MicroStrategy, are the most famous and aggressive public buyers of bitcoin in the world. MicroStrategy holds more than 124,391 bitcoin, while Saylor has stated he holds 17,732 as of 2020. Yet nearly two years into making their first public foray into Bitcoin, neither Saylor nor MicroStrategy have visibly engaged in any work to enhance the development efforts of Bitcoin or the surrounding software ecosystem to the benefit of that massive investment.Saylor’s messaging in interviews is consistent, and to be sure, he does an excellent job of boiling down core concepts to general audiences via apt metaphors. Digital gold is an excellent mental model for describing bitcoin’s supply cap value to a new audience, one which he leverages liberally. But as the aphorism goes, “All models are wrong. Some are useful.”Even the usefulness of the digital gold metaphor, however, quickly collapses beyond a superficial analysis, so allowing it to shape narrative and thinking too seriously quickly becomes counterproductive. This is for the simple reason that bitcoin isn’t an inanimate rock or a static element on the periodic table. It’s ever-evolving software, one that must continue to be maintained and improved on.Saylor’s messaging and active investment strategy betrays the same underlying attitude behind models like S2F: The work behind Bitcoin is done, and success and growth is assured based on its static properties.“Number go up.”The issue with this attitude is simple. The battle is not won and not by a long shot. Suggesting otherwise, worse than creating misleading expectations, actively hampers our efforts to continue improving Bitcoin as a technology today.How can we when a significant portion of the ecosystem, including its most prominent investor, are happy to stack sats and let a small cadre of open-source developers continue to do the work of actually advancing the Bitcoin protocol?Some will take issue with this very premise and argue that Bitcoin’s success is inevitable based on the strength of that technology today. Bitcoin’s success, however, is not actually an all-or-nothing prospect that we can speak authoritatively about in advance.Even if we accept the argument that the success of bitcoin as an asset due to its fixed supply and network effect is of high certainty, that does not guarantee the success of Bitcoin as a platform for a “full stack,” peer-to-peer financial ecosystem.It’s well known that Bitcoin’s base protocol layer has limited transaction throughput by design. This design choice ensures that the base layer remains as decentralized as possible — its most important property. On top of this foundation, new software tools and layers can and are being built which increase the scalability of transaction throughput and other functions.These solutions present a wide array of differing trade-offs, from relatively simple and purely centralized like Cash App and exchanges to self-custodial and largely decentralized like the Lightning Network. The latter category of solutions are intrinsically more difficult to build, so Bitcoin inevitability and the resultant complacency is simply not compatible with the community wide effort needed to enable these solutions to win out over easier, centralized alternatives.Failing to correct for this will result in the wider Bitcoin ecosystem suffering from choke points and resilience shortcomings which can and will be easily leveraged by adversarial actors to attack the network and its participants.Potential future outcomes in this area are nuanced and uncertain, and they can ultimately only be shaped via action. We can choose to ignore this and continue to rest on our laurels, assured in a degree of limited success at best. Or we can choose to continue down the technological rabbit hole of extending self-custodial and P2P solutions to as many people as possible.The limiting factor for supporting more innovative self-custody and P2P solutions on top of Bitcoin remains in the core protocol itself.To be clear, Bitcoin’s core protocol is limited and focused as a deliberate design decision which improves both scalability (unlike much more stateful alternatives like Ethereum) and attack surface. However, its current capabilities are simply not enough to support a full-stack P2P ecosystem. There are dozens of open Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), many of them which possess significant conceptual ACKs (meaning agreement with the general goal of the proposal) with work slowly underway or, worse yet, at stages of high maturity simply waiting for adequate review, discussion and motivation to merge. With four years elapsed between the last two significant protocol updates, SegWit and Taproot, there’s surely much improvement to be made.However, complementary to the “inevitable success” attitude is the “inevitable ossification” attitude. Protocol ossification refers to when a protocol becomes so widely used that the number and diversity of stakeholders involved makes continued development of the protocol practically impossible, freezing it in place. This is, of course, ultimately an indicator of success, as it speaks to the widespread dominance of that protocol.However, some will argue that ossification sooner rather than later is actually desirable as a defense against malicious changes to the Bitcoin core protocol, a la SegWit2x. This attitude entirely ignores and greatly increases another exploitable attack vector: stalling and preventing beneficial changes to the protocol which can enable more robust peer-to-peer and self-custodial solutions on subsequent layers. Indeed, after the spectacular failure of SegWit2x, any adversary would likely conclude the stalling strategy to be far more viable. In understanding that our window for beneficial protocol enhancements may, in fact, be rapidly closing due to the natural process of protocol ossification, and that stalling further development is arguably a much more likely attack vector than pushing through a deliberately malicious change, our urgency to continue extending Bitcoin functionality today should be higher rather than lower. There is certainly no pro-Bitcoin case to hasten ossification now or in the near future, especially in the context of there being many more obviously beneficial changes and extensions to be made. Protocol ossification, like properly understood Bitcoin maximalism, isn’t prescriptive but rather descriptive.It should be noted that the argument here isn’t that any shortcuts be taken, or some arbitrarily determined schedule of soft forks be adhered to for the sake of progress.I do, however, hold that taking another four years to implement a significant extension of the core protocol would be an utter failure for the Bitcoin community. With so many compelling active BIPs and a passionate and active ecosystem of individuals and organizations, there is simply no reason for it. Community discussion needs to be aggressively focused on shortening the process to develop, vet, debate, improve and activate these proposals safely while we still have the ability to do so. Indeed, after over 5.5 BTC was organically pledged to a bounty in support of finding showstopping bugs in BIP-119 “CTV,” there does seem to be significant community demand to do just that.Bitcoin has come a long way in 13 years, and as should be expected, its progress and growth has led to dramatic changes in its reach and community makeup. With this change comes an evolving landscape of discourse and ideas, and the ideas that win out will increasingly be the simplest ones which appeal to the greatest common denominator. It should be no surprise then that “digital gold,” for all its elegance, has gained such traction. Or that simple price projection models which confirm our most basic biases are tracked and iterated on with such fanfare.The issue lies not with such ideas existing or even gaining popularity. All models, while flawed, serve their purpose. The purpose of these concepts is to initiate the beginning of a funnel for more mainstream audiences. To provide easily digestible analogies allows newcomers the comfort to begin wading into an immensely deep ocean. This purpose flounders, however, if their own evangelists and the community at large fails to lay the groundwork and impetus to push ever deeper.As a community, we fail when, in chasing the mainstream, we lose sight of the original spirit in which Bitcoin was created and bootstrapped. We fail when we are so easily seduced by our own clever marketing, and victimized by our own overconfidence, that we lose sight of the core principle which brought about this humble experiment and upon which all else continues to depend on. We can succeed by remembering it.Cypherpunks write code.This is a guest post by Ariel Deschapelle.

2022-02-10T16:00:00-05:00,"The backbone of our nation, farmers stand to benefit the most from a sovereign money that cannot be diluted or degraded.With special contributions by: Texas Slim, Clemenza, Mark Maraia and Colin CrossmanThanks to Bitcoin Magazine giving my voice an outlet, throughout 2021, I have brought to your attention issues that I believe are plaguing the general health and well-being of the public. These include by way of diet and decision-making and how those effects are bleeding into the healthcare (doctors and nurses, but also health insurance) sectors, as well as education and the economy itself. Unfortunately, the problems don’t stop there — we need to follow in the footsteps of Alice and venture further down the rabbit hole. The walls of this particular rabbit hole are structured with accountability and responsibility (check out my conversation with BTC Sessions where we briefly discuss this topic here).America has been pushed from the pinnacle of learning, opportunity, and modern achievement into a corner of general deception and decay. One ought to ask: How did we get here? Well, let us consider the benefits — and consequences — of generations developing and proliferating across a period of history subsequent to America establishing a new world order with the IMF and World Bank via the Bretton Woods Agreement. The ease of life that followed in peacetime started at the peak of the power dynamic — politicians and bankers — thanks to global reserve status, and over the decades, has bled down through the socioeconomic hierarchies, across corporations, brick-and-mortar businesses, and eventually down to the average citizen — until the 1970s. This easy lifestyle, enjoying the benefits of living from a position of leverage and power (thanks to the credit-based economy exacerbated by Nixon), has allowed complacency to flourish to extremely dangerous levels. Which, if we’re being completely honest, is easy to understand — just not easy to accept, nor identify when the consequences of such activity is not being felt to a significant extent that merits (or requires) reflection and rethinking. Until now. Ultimately, America’s political and economic woes can be seen quite easily by looking at the general public health crisis. We have been receiving the signals for decades, yet we continue to overlook and even ignore these warnings and notifications. By ignoring these omens, we risk following the very same path as great empires of history. If we do not act to re-route America’s health crisis, which encompasses both mental and physical health, then I fear that America’s time in the sun will end up resembling that of Icarus. These signals are most easily identifiable within our health industries, which include — but are not limited to — hospitals and medical practices, insurance and hospitality, fitness, food producers, diet and nutrition practices.""The proper role of government, however, is that of partner with the farmer — never his master. By every possible means we must develop and promote that partnership — to the end that agriculture may continue to be a sound, enduring foundation for our economy and that farm living may be a profitable and satisfying experience."" — President Dwight D. Eisenhower, special message to the Congress on Agriculture, September 1, 1956David Montgomery is not a household name, but I believe that will change over the coming years and decades. As America continues down a path of economic hardship, thanks to the unraveling of our Keynesian economic system due to such liberal monetary policy and protectionist measures of propping up nonproductive corporate ventures … trouble is brewing just outside of our sight picture. Image source: GoogleAs I’ve burrowed further and further down the Bitcoin rabbit hole over the past years, I’ve learned so much that I may have actually developed an addiction. What started with investing strategies and economics has led to further investigations in my own particular field, health, the money behind much of the “health sector,” and recently to where our health comes from. That would be nutrition, yes, but following first principles thinking (FPT), we come to the real genesis — farming and its bedfellows, ranching and animal husbandry.Of particular note to me would be the relationship of agriculture and the health of a civilization, especially in the death throes of empires across the ages. Montgomery covers this briefly in his publication, “Growing a Revolution.” Montgomery goes on to describe this revolution within farming against modern agricultural practices (much like there’s a rebellion occurring within economic circles, doubting Keynesian efficacy and seeking out different/better solutions, like bitcoin). You see, one problem that Montgomery uncovered along his journey was a relationship that I had not heard expounded upon before.While the inflation angle is talked about religiously, pointing to the “why” a particular empire imploded upon itself, the food is rarely talked about as the final straw. I’m talking about the straw, you know … the one that “broke the camel’s back?” A societal collapse of historical importance can ultimately be boiled down to one very simple (but priceless) variable that any community requires: the provision of consistent food production. Whether we’re talking about the first communities that had begun cultivating crops some 12,000 years ago, or we’re discussing active revolution from under a ruling power, the driver(s) of revolt end up disrupting the food supply. Rome and Paris both had this pressure point in common: bread shortages sparked public outrage. But what ultimately led to these shortages? Was it greed by the farmers? Could they have been extorting prices of crops due to a monetary landscape that was producing hardship? Or was it, perhaps, gluttony by the citizenry? Driven by an insatiable hunger of an entitled populace that grew up during an age of plenty and relative comfort.“Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and you’re a thousand miles from the corn field.” — President Dwight D. EisenhowerIn reality, it was neither of these. What Montgomery describes on multiple occasions throughout his book is a series of events in history that don’t technically repeat, but they certainly do rhyme. Where an empire reaches peak power, actual growth stagnates. The ruling class attempts to push growth further by manufacturing (fabricating) it through inflationary monetary policies that eventually bleed into aggressive and destructive agricultural and harvesting practices. In the search for yield, these societies end up turning to strategies that sacrifice soil longevity and health. Eventually reaching a tipping point, where the soil can no longer support the desired output. These observations have even been highlighted by great philosophers of antiquity, like Plato and Aristotle who identified this relationship of agrarian techniques and rapid topsoil erosion.Talk about a rabbit hole, huh? I mean, this is a problem that has been a problem since the first nomads decided to settle and sow what would become the seeds of farming strategies that would last across the ages. And we’re still doing it, just with greater technology and some improvements on understanding. Yet, we’re still making big mistakes.Which can also mean we’re driving the issue faster. As we’ve been discussing and learning about the economics that our modern society machinates, the very obvious connection that I, personally, began to ponder was the effects of modern economic and monetary policies upon public health. I often found myself asking, “If our economy is so great, and we’re ‘the greatest country in the world,’ why is it that we have some of the worst education ratings and health demographics on the planet?” This led me to a level of outrage that fueled a string of articles starting with this one. This article sparked up conversations with multiple great minds in the Bitcoin space, one of particular note that I want to bring to focus occurred between myself and Texas Slim.Slim is doing some fascinating work, but of specific relevance to our journey today is his substack and the recent work that Clemenza has put together for Slim. Clemenza poetically happened to publish this work with Slim in parallel to my reading through Montgomery, and I honestly had to do a mental double take, not to mention pinch myself. Could it be that I was going down this journey at a literal perfect time to also come across Slim and Clemenza’s work? Clemenza provides a framing that really knocked me on my ass here:“Have you connected the dots? Not only are our food processing practices providing poor nutrient density and non-bioavailable sources, but the natural sources we are growing are lacking 87% of the nutrients and vitamins as those that our grandparents grew up on. How much more obvious does it need to become that our legitimate pandemic of health is not just from poor physical activity but also with regards to our food sources? But this isn’t even the scary part guys….”The scary part? Our soil health is even worse.Montgomery goes on to write about the 2015 Agricultural Organizational Report, where it was stated that “soil degradation erodes global crop capacity by 0.05% per year.” On top of this, a third of the world’s agricultural land has been eroded. Going even further, despite heavy agro-chemical use by Western nations, up to 40% of global crop yields are lost to pests and disease. And then, down the line after said crops have been collected, ~25% of what is not lost to pests or disease gets wasted between production and consumption. Meaning that when it’s all said and done, we’re only capturing ~45% of the food we’re producing. I can feel the tension building in you from here … but there’s more gas to throw on this specific fire. Particularly around an industry that gets overlooked, rather aggressively, fertilizers.“Most people fail to realize that the lack of nourishment in our food today comes from the farming practices draining our soil’s richness. Let's take oranges, for example. Today, we need to eat eight oranges to get our grandparents’ same nutrients from one. Nutrient degradation in our soil poses a severe threat to our ability to feed 9 billion people by the year 2050 in a way that promotes vitality and a healthy way of life.” — @cannoliclemenza, “We Are Overfed and Undernourished”*(Did you do the math from that previous quote? Our fresh food is yielding ~12% of the foods of our grandparents' time.)The fertilizer industry is fascinating. Did you know that plants require nitrogen to grow, yet they cannot utilize the nitrogen gas that dominates our air? This is because nitrogen gas is extremely stable. So, the missing step in the equation was figuring out how to get nitrogen into the soil in order to stimulate growth in our crops. How did we do it? Bombs.…not that way.... During WWI, two scientists, by the names of Carl Bosch and Fritz Haber, devised a method to produce ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen gas while searching for a way to produce bombs that delivered a larger payload. However, after the end of WWII, bomb factories that were relied upon heavily for both global conflicts rapidly pivoted to fertilizer factories. Fast-forward around 50 or 60 years and we find ourselves looking at Koch Fertilizer and Cargill, which according to Montgomery (Chapter 4), are two entities that dominate the fertilizer industry.Sources in imageMontgomery refers to Guy Swanson, a regenerative farmer, who analogizes the fertilizer industry to that of narcotics. He makes this comparison rather effective when likening the fertilizer industry to the negative feedback loop of drug addiction: Give a small appetizer of the product and get the prospect hooked off the immediate benefits, even though long-term use of the product will degrade health over time (whether this is out of ignorance or willful does not matter), which will drive the client back to the dealer as they seek a quick-fix remedy to the pains of their plight. The problem? According to Montgomery’s work, only about 50% of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers get taken up by soil. The rest gets carried away in the water table, ending up in our rivers, streams and oceans. Right next to the soil that gets eroded away by tillage. My own home state of Iowa has seen 50% of her native topsoil eroded away by this process since the days of the pioneers, with 30–40% of what is lost in recent history coming from gullies alone.Look, I get it, this is all so boring and taking forever. It’s soil and fertilizer — not the best small-talk conversation around drinks. But, it is extremely important that we have this conversation and identify these problems. We can’t fix our shortcomings without first identifying them to begin with. Why is this all so negatively impacting? Well, firstly we can start with asking, why do we fertilize soil to begin with? And then we can ask why are we addicted to fertilizer use?“Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic; but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.” — William Jennings BryanWe add fertilizer (herbicides and pesticides) to our soils in order to drive the growth of our cover crops so that we can capture the greatest crop yield and get one step further in progress toward solving the hunger problem. But this still begs the question, why do we need fertilizer?Image source: GoogleLet’s pretend, for conversation’s sake, that we have a farm with absolutely perfect soil quality and climate. We may not need fertilizers for quite a while, but if we’re practicing modern farming techniques (aka, “extraction farming”), the soil will ultimately be degraded (because the nutrients have to come from the soil, and if those nutrients aren’t being replenished at an equitable rate then we get…) to the point of needing nutrient supplementation via fertilizers. The reason is a multifaceted flywheel. First, the process of tilling breaks up the surface tension of the soil, destroying root systems, but also opening up the layers beneath to the extreme conditions of the open air. This can come in the form of intense rains that can carry away this newly exposed soil, or it can come in the form of direct sunlight and heat, which dries out the soil. But the heat doesn’t just dry the soil up, this heat also sterilizes the layers that have been newly exposed. This was emphasized by Rattan Lal (p.79, Montgomery), soil science PhD, and then confirmed when comparing temperatures of tilled farm soil temperatures to those of natural forests (a 20 degrees difference). Not only do tilled fields require more watering, but once soil temperature climbs above ~90 degrees Fahrenheit biological activity ceases. Meaning earthworms, root systems, and even the microscopic organisms that make up the mycorrhizal biome that produces the glucose that plant roots feed upon. This is where we finally arrive at the point.How often do we think that our farmlands encounter summer days where the soil temperature approaches 90 degrees? I assure you that I do not have the answer, but growing up in Iowa … blistering hot days were quite common. When biological activity in soil stops, imagine it’s like stopping an entire economy for two weeks and thinking everything will be copasetic after. Okay, that was a half-joke. But seriously, the microbiome of soil is one of the most important systems to protect — without it, we’d all starve. Yet this problem continues to get worse because, while the tilling alone is causing plenty of problems for the logistics of organic matter cultivation, we’re also dumping loads upon loads of herbicides and pesticides onto our fields. Even after engineering genetically modified crops (intended to be resistant to pests), pesticide use increased by 7% according to a 2012 study. So, by tilling fields we are increasing erosion, destroying biological activity that improves soil environment, weakening soil health, which is weakening the nutrient density of our crops, introducing herbicides/pesticides to our water sources (poisoning not just ourselves, but other food sources we consume), all of which is producing a negative feedback loop on the longevity and strength of the soil upon which we base our entire lives.One of the very important dynamics of this agrarian system of relationships that is also heavily overlooked, (or rather, in my opinion, willfully ignored) is the relationship that livestock and ranching play in this very complex ecosystem. Movements like The Beef Initiative represent a return of classic, regenerative methods of understanding the source of our food and the access to high-quality beef. “Standard feedlot cows are fed genetically modified (GMO) soy and corn which contain toxic herbicides and pesticides. Cattle also receive hormone therapy to assist in weight gain, which allows the cow to be sold at a faster rate. Unfortunately, at times, profit is a priority over quality when it comes to supply and demand. This is why it is so important to weaponize your health by obtaining high-quality beef from an organic or regenerative rancher. Today’s farmers and ranchers are strong examples of true conservationists. They have a deep love and appreciation for the land because it in turn supports their families.” — Texas SlimThose animals also provide very important nutrients to the soil microbiome, of substantial note being nitrates and carbon. Nitrogen is that ever-important element that we mentioned earlier that plants need but many cannot pull from the atmosphere. They can pull carbon, luckily. However, carbon is a compound of high demand for life to flourish. There’s a lot of conversation going on around pulling carbon from the atmosphere, but very little being said around needing to get it back into our soil. Without having a healthy and diverse ecosystem beneath the surface, our crops don’t grow as strong and healthy as we need them to, so that our children can grow strong and healthy, so they can grow up to be smarter and stronger than ourselves, in order to solve the bigger and badder problems that they will face long after we are gone.What is the solution?“A nation that destroys its soil, destroys itself.” — Franklin D. RooseveltNow, the really, really fun part? The solution is one of a very similar structuring to that which is championed by the Bitcoin community: “Buy, and don’t sell,” but it is also more difficult than a single catchphrase. We have to farm in a manner that is much more aligned with natural mechanisms. Not by trying to force Mother Nature via synthetic compounds, herbicides and pesticides. One thing that I have learned in my time in the health field: You don’t work against Mother Nature; she wins every time, you either work with her or fail.The reason it’s difficult? The strategy requires a relatively complex scheduling of rotating cover crops between corn, soybean and wheat, as well as incorporating livestock rotations to provide manure for the fields. Very importantly, there is no tilling. By cutting out tilling, you maintain the surface tension of the root systems which act by protecting the microorganisms that dwell just below the surface of our planet. This ecosystem is extremely sensitive to exposure to the dynamics that come along with the open air, like temperature, weather and direct sunlight exposure, just to name a few. And even more important for the health of crops and soil diversity is that this wildly impactful mechanism provides very important nutrients to these plants that we need to nourish ourselves. If we want to answer why our populations are so unhealthy and weak, we have to look at why our foods are so unhealthy and weak … and if we are being honest with ourselves — which, right now, “we” are having a very, very hard time with being honest with ourselves — the next step along the FPT path leads us to the health of our soil.What no-till farming ends up doing is attacking this worldwide problem on a slew of fronts. I’m talking about improvements in crop yields, fertilizer expenses, fuel expenses, water use, seed purchases (since GMO crops were supposed to reduce the need for fertilizers but actually increased the demand for more) and pesticides. Time to run some numbers. Dwayne Beck, director of Dakota Lakes Research Farm (and first introduced in Montgomery’s book starting in Chapter 6), provides some statistics:“Beck increased his soybean yields by 25 percent, from 63 bushels an acre to 79 bushels an acre. At the same time, corn yields increased as well, rising from 203 bushels an acre for continuous corn to 217 bushels an acre for a corn-soybean-rotation, and 235 bushels an acre for the more complex rotation, The whole system became more productive under a diversified rotation. And because it uses fewer inputs – less diesel, fertilizer, and herbicide – it’s even more profitable” (“Growing a Revolution,” p.106). On Beck’s research farm they take all matters into consideration with their cover crop rotation studies, even so far as tire pressure — so as to avoid squeezing the water out of the soil, like a sponge. Oh, and with regards to that last claim of “requiring fewer inputs,” Beck also gives us this bit of data: “An increase of organic matter content from 1 percent to 3 percent can double the soil’s water-holding capacity, while helping to prevent water logging that leads to the anaerobic conditions that favor soil-dwelling pathogens” (p.98).To finish with one last bit of information as justification for any farmers that happen to read this long-winded piece of mine, this time coming from Dan Forgey, manager of Cronin Farms (20,000 acres comprising 40% cropped farmland and 60% native prairie pasture). Now, what Forgey is doing is much, much more complex. By incorporating a mixture of 10 different crops, he’s been working to improve organic matter and soil carbon on his lands:“So far they’ve increased their soil carbon by 1 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but Forgey says that each percent of organic matter holds about $600 worth of nutrients an acre” (p.109).Now we have to answer, “why do farmers choose to till then, if no-till is so much better?” Government subsidies. Remember my latest article, the one about the American education system? I mentioned in there how government subsidization (along with unionization) ultimately culminated into a parasitic relationship that produced a negative feedback loop. And in this article, I discussed how government support in Corporate America produced a parasitic relationship that produced a negative feedback loop. Oh, and then this article, where I discussed the corner that insurance companies have been backed into thanks to a witch’s brew concocted out of the bond market and the propping up of zombie companies. The problem is that our farmers are not in any better of a position, which really disheartens me. If you’ve never met a generational, Midwestern farmer, these folks can be the most compassionate and effective individuals on the planet (and lively to boot). Our farmers have been constantly under pressure especially in the past 50 years. As was infamously put by Earl Butz in 1973 to “get big, or get out,” America’s Nixon administration made it quite clear that their desire was for America’s farmers to industrialize (and centralize) in the search for fast money. This can hardly be disputed when considering the USDA secretary’s words here in combination with Nixon’s cessation of the gold standard. Since then the farmer’s flywheel has been spinning faster and faster, allowing large farmers to rapidly expand and industrialize while their smaller neighbors are forced to either double down and grip the wheel harder, or risk being cast out. All the while, we are destroying generational livelihoods and our own country’s health in the same breath.“…cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the most independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interests by the most lasting bands.”— Thomas JeffersonOkay, we are finally to the point. Bitcoin — where does it fit into this equation? Well, we just got done discussing how farmers in America got hit with a quick left and a hard, nasty right hook back in the 1970s. Bitcoin would’ve been a fantastic rope to fall back on then, unfortunately … it just wasn’t there. However, we have it today.Our farmers need bitcoin now. Inflation is hitting every corner of the market: shipping, resources, fuel, maintenance, replacement parts, fertilizers, costs of labor … the list literally goes on and on. But farmers need more than just bitcoin, they need our patience and our willingness to have the conversation. We’ve discussed how beaten and bruised our farmers are from decades of abuse, and how little time or energy they can afford to sacrifice thanks to the hamster wheel that Nixon and Butz forced them into. Farmers that benefit from Bitcoin’s average ~200% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) can utilize BTC as a cushion to fall back on for those wishing to take the risk of transitioning from industrial “power” farming to regenerative (or “restorative”) farming. Cutting the subsidized fiat umbilical can be a big and scary risk, I wouldn’t judge anyone that is wary.Bitcoin as a “hard money that can’t be f***** with” allows for our farmers to store (or invest) funds that would otherwise have been risked in equities for profits, or even used as a hedge or insurance for their crops (Mother Nature has a way of using seasonal weather to test our farmers). Our farmers — and their families — are extremely sensitive to the health of our economy, and with how overvalued equities are, and the bond market going through an existential crisis … I would sleep better at night knowing that the literal backbone of our nation is well supported.Bitcoin added to the balance sheets of insurance providers that farmers rely on could help ensure that they will be supported in the face of market chaos. Bitcoin custodied by farmers, and their families, could protect them from fears of any possibilities of bail-ins or account freezes by banks. Recent examples in Lebanon and Turkey stand as grim reminders that these are very real possibilities for every citizen living under a government regime that is commanded by a central banking authority. Bitcoin-supported small businesses, machinists and truck drivers could help ensure that food continues to be provided, in some measure, in the face of potential hyperinflationary scenarios. By having an economy that is supported by bitcoin (and Bitcoiners), we could provide a literal life raft to communities in the face of potentially catastrophic economic and transportation conditions. Just recently we got a great example of how bitcoin (and its community) is capable of supporting economic hardships far and above what current fiat systems (and their brigade of middlemen and rent-seekers) can provide. As the volcano near Tonga spewed enough gas and debris to blot out the sun (including cell and internet signals), donation wallets were generated and funds began to flow virtually immediately to provide support to the people in need.Just to be clear, these strategies apply globally. There is nothing that I am saying that is excluding our friends in Africa, Central, or South America, the Middle East, Europe or Asia. Not to mention the large portion of food that is imported to America, we actually need our international friends and suppliers of food abroad to begin protecting themselves with bitcoin, as well as longevity solutions such as restorative farming practices. Bitcoin is a global phenomenon and stands to support any individual regardless of nation of birth, creed, race, political affiliation or net worth. Bitcoin is about self-sovereignty. Restorative farming is about food sovereigntyBitcoin is about self-preservation. So is healthy soil. Bitcoin is about maintaining sustainability and longevity. So is healthy soil. Bitcoin is about the best solution for every participant, especially if it's the difficult one.All of the above points encompass regenerative farming values, and lastly...Regenerative (“restorative”) farming is proof of work.“Because the solution challenges a century of conventional wisdom and powerful commercial interests, and requires a profound shift in how we think about and treat the least glamorous resource of all – the soil beneath our feet.” — David Montgomery, “Growing a Revolution.”Photo by Thomas Pierre on Unsplash.This is a guest post by Mike Hobart.

2022-02-10T14:58:01-05:00,"The man who holds the record for most years outperforming the S&P 500 is deeply invested in bitcoin.Legendary value investor Bill Miller reiterated in a Wednesday interview that holding bitcoin is akin to having insurance against financial catastrophe, echoing comments he made last month as he disclosed that bitcoin comprised half of his fortune.Miller explained that bitcoin doesn’t account for 50% of his portfolio any longer given the digital currency’s price decline over the past couple of months. However, he said his allocation to bitcoin still is “very big.”“It's like an insurance policy,” the chairman and chief investment officer of Miller Value Partners said, according to a Markets Insider report.“Insurance policies have no intrinsic value. In fact, you want them to have no intrinsic value. You don’t want to have your house burned down, or get in a terrible accident, but you pay for insurance every year in case that happens,” he added.Whether anything has intrinsic value or not is a topic of debate, as some argue all value is subjective to human judgment. However, Miller’s point converses with the instability of many countries’ financial systems around the world.“Bitcoin is insurance against financial catastrophe as we see in Lebanon, or in Afghanistan, or many of these other countries where we saw (that) around the time of the pandemic,” Miller said.Afghanistan last year suffered from intense economic instability after a complete U.S. military withdrawal led to the government’s collapse. Residents of the Afghan capital, Kabul, hit a brick wall in August as they sought to withdraw money from their bank accounts and flee the country as Taliban fighters took over the city demanding the government’s surrender. Bitcoin quickly became a tool for financial freedom in the central Asian country.Miller, who holds the record for most consecutive years outperforming the S&P 500 between 1991 and 2005, also said in the interview that KPMG Canada’s recent bitcoin allocation was a bullish move.“I think you're going to see a lot of adoption among foundations and endowments and institutions this year, and that's going to continue,” he said."
2022-02-10T12:05:23-05:00,"Watch This Episode On YouTubeListen To This Episode:""Bitcoin Bottom Line"" hosts Steven McClurg and C.J. Wilson opened this latest episode by talking about international bitcoin adoption. Wilson asked McClurg if he believes the criticism that leaders of countries face will diminish after more countries begin to adopt Bitcoin. McClurg does not anticipate this to change and he recognized that “a lot of people that come into power and want to make positive changes in their country have a difficult time doing it all at once.” He includes an example of Saudi Arabia taking small strides to improve its country, but it cannot change all at once.McClurg stated, “Changing your entire currency system to bitcoin with the hope of financial freedom is one step in the direction to overall freedom.” Wilson said that we must look at these situations on a broad, long-term scale; have a low time preference, and be patient. Like the government, it can be difficult for companies to change quickly, especially if they are public.Many people have been moving to or visiting El Salvador recently. The hosts believe that this is due to its Bitcoin adoption. Over the past two years, many people have been moving to places with like-minded people and fewer taxes.Texas government officials have become pro Bitcoin recently. Texas is looking to attract the mining industry and has great potential because it is an oil- and gas-energy-focused state. Wilson noted surprise that many other states have not followed in Texas and Wyoming’s footsteps of adopting Bitcoin, especially with their natural resources.McClurg stated that Bitcoin is a movement for the people, and it has been happening organically. Politicians are increasingly becoming pro-bitcoin. Wilson hopes that Bitcoin adoption will become a “non-story” because it will be successful and ubiquitous. McClurg predicted that in two to four years, political candidates who are not pro-bitcoin will be compared to flat earthers.McClurg and Wilson ended the episode by looking at the nuance of crypto to say that we do not have to make generalizations. We can take a unique look at every leader, state, city and country to rank them internally."
2022-02-10T08:57:33-05:00,"With Intel set to present an ASIC geared for bitcoin mining later this month, how will the computing giant reshape the industry’s landscape?When news surfaced that one of the largest computer chip makers in the world, Intel, would give a presentation about an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) geared for bitcoin mining at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), a global forum for presentation of advances in solid-state circuits and systems-on-a-chip to be held online later this month, the first logical conclusion was that the company would be presenting a new chip it had developed specifically for the activity.On the very next day, publicly-listed bitcoin miner GRIID disclosed that it had signed a purchase agreement with Intel for acquiring fixed-price bitcoin mining ASIC hardware from the chipmaker for orders placed before May 2023, in what appeared to be a move to secure access to Intel’s new chip to be presented at the upcoming conference.However, an Intel representative indicated that the company has done design work around SHA-256 optimized ASICs “for several years,” and will not unveil a new ASIC at ISSCC in a statement shared with Bitcoin Magazine.“The SHA-256 ASIC referred to in the paper being presented at ISSCC … was our first generation product exploration from 2018,” the Intel statement said.In 2018, Intel released a patent for a “bitcoin mining hardware accelerator with optimized message digest and message scheduler datapath,” which outlined a more efficient way to find a valid block hash. It claimed to be able to decrease energy use by up to 35% while lowering financial requirements and mining more bitcoin in the process.Intel will present the advances in its solid-state circuit designs for bitcoin mining that have been made since that patent was filed, but will not unveil a completely new ASIC. However, GRIID’s purchase is indeed for a new chip that is yet to be announced.“The supply agreement released as part of required [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] SEC disclosures from our customer concerns the second-generation ASIC for which we will provide more details soon,” the Intel representative added.Bitcoin Magazine talked with Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, one of the largest publicly-traded bitcoin mining companies in the world, to gather some insights into the current shortcomings of the industry and what may help solve them in the near future.“The market has been characterized over the last two years by constraints in availability of quality miners,” Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine, referring to the worldwide chip shortage since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Bitmain — which has been the quality and performance leader in the bitcoin miner manufacturing space since the introduction of its S19 mining rig — has solidified itself as the main ASIC maker in the world, Thiel added, helped by how the chip shortage has more dramatically impacted some of the tier-two suppliers.“The only reason Bitmain has the position they have today is because of the availability of miners,” Thiel added. “If there were no constraints on a basic way for starts at the foundries, you would see many more people in this industry and Bitmain would be one of many brands, and the competition would be around performance and cost of ownership, not around availability.”Additionally, Bitmain has, for the most part, been able to provide the most energy-efficient miners in the world, catering to a need demonstrated by bitcoin mining companies that continually chase down the energy curve.“We’re all very focused on being the most energy-efficient miners,” Thiel said. “We will typically always chase the most energy-efficient miner because the less electricity we use, the less burden we put on the electrical infrastructure and the less it costs us to operate.”New entrants in the industry like Intel could shake Bitmain’s comfortable position as the global leader in ASIC manufacturing by prompting more competition and likely leading to greater machine availability. The onset of new developments often push old-timers to pursue greater projects as it casts doubt on their ability to remain competitive without innovating.“It’s about removing the constraints in the industry that existed and the kind of monopoly, or quasi-monopoly, that Bitmain has,” Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine, adding that Intel’s introduction as a new merchant silicon vendor “is good” as “it is a new foundry capacity.”“So, it means more overall capacity in the marketplace,” Thiel said. “Now that Intel has come out and started talking about it, you’re going to see other people wanting to protect their potential for market share by saying that they’re going to be in the market too.”Thiel said that he expects a slew of vendors to start competing in the ASIC-producing industry in the coming year as new entrants try to obtain market share and pose competition to Bitmain.Thiel didn’t provide more details, but hinted that there are three U.S.-based companies that have done ground-up designs and two more working on ground-up designs. There are also teams from major universities looking at ASIC manufacturing and design, he said.If the entrance of these new companies in the industry materialize and the supply chain issues at the foundries start to resolve, hardware could commoditize, ensuing a race to low-cost hardware.“And as hosting becomes more available because everybody is building out hosting capacity, I think what you’re going to find is there will be very little constraint around the growth rate of the global hash rate,” Thiel said. “Hardware will be readily available, hosting will be available and then it’s just a question of where is the price of bitcoin that is economically feasible to mine, and what price are you willing to pay to be in business today versus tomorrow versus next year?”If some constraints are removed from the industry, Bitcoin’s hash rate could grow immensely. As a result, profitability would diminish for new entrants seeking to mine BTC as the bitcoin-producing market gets more competitive, requiring players to have a greater share of the global hash rate to remain in business.“It’s an arms race; there are only 900 bitcoin made per day currently, and there are a lot of people with a lot of capital chasing that,” Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine.An even more competitive mining market could lead to alternative products being offered as barriers of entry increase the required amount of capital to be deployed for mining profitably.“I think you are going to see growth in some of these hash rate derivatives,” Thiel said. “And as more demand for hash rate futures grows, then you’re going to see industrial miners selling portions of their hash rate for a few months to finance miners or other equipment, and that will be a way that people can play in this industry without even having to buy miners, they can just buy hash rate.”Purchasing hash rate directly enables miners to compete in getting block rewards without needing to rent a huge physical space, secure 24/7 efficient hosting or acquire a lot of equipment upfront.“At the end of the day, are you mining because you want to heat up your garage or are you mining because you want to earn bitcoin? And how do you want to go about paying potential for passive income relative to bitcoin mining? Do you want to do it as an investor by just buying hash rate futures, or investing in a public miner, or do you want to buy miners yourself and mine?” Thiel asked. “I think everybody is going to have to make that decision on their own and figure it out.”"

2022-02-09T16:30:57-05:00,"Bitcoiners have raised over 14.7 bitcoin worth more than $657,000 for the Canadian freedom truckers.Bitcoin fundraising just gets more attractive as fiat fundraising firms are proving to be unreliable when it comes to raising donations for the Truckers Freedom Convoy in Ottawa, Canada.Fiat fundraising platforms further added to their unreliableness as GoFundMe’s replacement for this movement, GiveSendGo, reportedly leaked passports and other personal information about the individuals who donated to the truckers fund.After fundraising company GoFundMe bowed to political pressure, freezing the truckers funds of over $9 million, protesters and donators also turned to raising funds in bitcoin — given its' censorship resistant qualities. A representative of the committee raising bitcoin donations for the truckers, known as Nobody Caribou told Bitcoin Magazine that he will discuss at a press conference in Ottawa today:“My proposal is that yes, we create an endowment. Yet to be approved by everyone on the board but I’m gonna push hard to show them the potential,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.According to committee member Greg Foss, Bitcoiners have raised over 14.7 bitcoin worth more than $657,000 at the time of writing.Bitcoin Twitter user LaserHodl recently put forth a fundraising challenge. He will donate 1 BTC if 9 other people join him for a total of 10 bitcoin. Currently 8 people have joined him in the initiative so far.A member of the fundraising committee BTC Sessions told Bitcoin Magazine:“I'm excited if he gets that to happen — it will mean that 1/1,000,000th of all bitcoin that will ever exist have been donated to a single cause — for freedom and body autonomy. That's powerful.”Nobody Caribou is set to further explain the reasons for electing to place all bitcoin donations in a Truckers Endowment Fund at the press conference today. The truckers are well supplied at the moment but there may be a need for other kinds of assistance particularly for hiring and paying lawyers.The world is watching to see how this unprecedented political protest will play out. There’s lots of head shaking at the bad plays being made by federal and local government in Canada.The Wall Street Journal, recently reported a good understanding of why this situation looks so bizarre stating: “The lesson for the Covid-19 police is that when you’ve lost even Canadians, arguably the most law-abiding people on the planet, you’ve lost the political plot.""The Bitcoin community is watching with interest as the first major fundraising effort using bitcoin attempts to raise 21 BTC for the initiative. As for the truckers in Ottawa, they’re not leaving until the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is enforced and all mandates and passports are gone."
2022-02-09T16:00:00-05:00,"Bitcoin is a fundamental discovery in a long chain of cryptographic progress.A recurring conversation in the Bitcoin community is the question “was Bitcoin invented or discovered?” Initially this question seems simple. Obviously Bitcoin was invented, wasn't it?No. In my opinion, Bitcoin, like any other scientific and technological “invention,” was discovered and not really invented.The purpose of this article is to explain this and to help you understand why if Satoshi Nakamoto had never existed, Bitcoin would have eventually been discovered by someone else.There is a figure in our collective unconscious showing the lone genius in his garage. This brilliant and misunderstood scientist is unraveling some of nature's great mysteries all by himself.This image is totally wrong. Even geniuses like Isaac Newton recognized that ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.""Figure 1: The front page of https://scholar.google.com/undefinedThis concept seems counterintuitive at first, but historical evidence supports this view.There are several scientific discoveries, such as calculus and the theory of natural selection, that have repeatedly occurred independently.For most of us, the theory of natural selection is classically attributed to Charles Darwin. His story is well known: he sailed around the world on the HMS Beagle, studied finches in the Galapagos Islands, the 1835 earthquake in Chile, and so on. What few people know is that nowadays the authorship of the theory of natural selection is attributed to Darwin-Wallace.That's because it took Darwin more than 20 years to publish his discovery, and in the meantime a young naturalist named Alfred Russell Wallace reached the same conclusions that Darwin had reached. Wallace studied the Amazon rainforest and the Malay Archipelago. Were they two isolated geniuses who discovered how evolution works quite independently?Yes and no. These two brilliant scientists had access to the same references. Both cite the work of James Hutton and Charles Lyell, two geologists who discussed how changes occurred gradually over a large span of time, known as geological time or deep time. This view is known as uniformitarianism and is opposed to catastrophism, which at the time was associated with the Great Flood and the idea that the Earth's age was only 10,000 years. Thanks to these authors, the concept of deep time began to exist in the scientific community. Both Darwin and Wallace read these works.The same goes for the work of Thomas R. Malthus. Malthus discussed the issue of finite resources and even sketched out ideas of “fight for life” and “survival of the fittest.” But he focused his work on population geography, not nature more broadly. Both Darwin and Wallace quoted Malthus' work as a key piece in the evolutionary puzzle.The same goes for Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who independently discovered calculus. Those mathematicians spent the rest of their lives struggling to establish who was the real inventor of calculus rather than considering that it could be developed twice in a short time.The term “adjacent possible” was coined in 1996 by Stuart Kauffman, an evolutionary biologist. For him, biological systems are capable of transforming into complex systems from incremental changes. This helps explain how complex systems originate: one step at a time.For example: the origin of life hypothetically occurred in a primitive environment known as ""primordial soup."" The atmosphere lacked oxygen, and was rich in hydrogen, ammonia, methane and water. Something caused these molecules to stick together and become amino acids. These were able to combine to form proteins and create organic material. This organic material may have eventually given rise to biological life as we know it today. Each step in this chain could not have existed before the previous step. Hydrogen, methane, water and ammonium wouldn't bond together to form proteins, but their recombined form called amino acids would.The adjacent possible is the essence of the scientific process, when new knowledge is discovered based on the available adjacent knowledge, whether books or scientific articles. Basically, existing scientific knowledge represents the pieces of a puzzle already assembled in front of everyone. The scientist who makes a discovery simply finds the fit of the most recently fitted piece.The original concept of “meme” was defined by biologist Richard Dawkins in the book “The Selfish Gene.” This book is a study of how genes are the unit of selection in evolution, not the species, group, or even the individual. In the book, the author proposes that genes are to biology what memes are to cultural information, and the smallest unit of cultural selection is a meme. In other words, both a story, a song and even an image with text on top are memes. Analogous to the “gene pool,” there is a “meme pool,” where all memes compete for space, are shared or forgotten. These cultural units are in a meme pool, where all scientists can consult the information.This meme pool is shared and makes the possibilities for scientific and cultural evolution limited to the adjacent possible that these units of cultural information allow. In other words, it would not be possible to have a theory of natural selection without Malthusianism or uniformitarianism.Figure 2 and 3 are schematic representations of the adjacent possible and the process of scientific progress.The fictional science of psychohistory, described by Isaac Asimov, illustrates this concept well. In psychohistory, even if the actions of a particular individual cannot be predicted, future events can be predicted using statistics applied to large populations.Both psychohistory, a concept from science fiction, and the adjacent possible, a concept from biology, have a common characteristic: the actions of specific individuals do not matter for the macro tendency.We like to think of ourselves as special snowflakes, but actually we're all quite commonplace with limited basic variations and a few possible personality archetypes, as the few categories in any personality test like the Holland Code (RIASEC) or Myers-Briggs tests demonstrate.Which raises the question: can a human being invent something really new?""Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age."" - Eric Hughes, Cypherpunk Manifesto, 1993As with the image of the lone scientist, we also tend to imagine Satoshi Nakamoto in this way. But in reality, he was also on the shoulder of giants when he conceived Bitcoin.Bitcoin may seem “new,” but in reality it is the culmination of a 30+ year process by a group of people interested in encryption and privacy. They are called ""the cypherpunks."" The Cypherpunk Manifesto dates back to 1993; several attempts to resolve the issue of conveying value with privacy without the need for a trusted external validator had already been made and failed. In a nutshell, we can simplify some of the puzzle pieces of the cypherpunk memetic pool used by Satoshi:It was by learning from all these attempts that Satoshi was able to reach the magical possible adjacent called Bitcoin. But the truth is that, as brilliant as Satoshi was, if he hadn't discovered Bitcoin in 2008, someone would have probably already discovered it by now.Figure 4: Timeline of Bitcoin prehistory from Plan B tweet.This is a guest post by Leta.

2022-02-09T15:28:28-05:00,"The world’s largest asset manager is reportedly planning to offer bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading to its investor clients.The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is reportedly planning to offer a bitcoin trading service to its investor clients, three people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.BlackRock entering the Bitcoin space by offering investment products to its clients could represent a watershed moment to the digital currency given that the New York-based firm manages over $10 trillion in assets for institutional investors.One of the people reportedly said the asset manager would let its clients get access to loans by putting up cryptocurrency as collateral with “client support trading and then with their own credit facility.”BlackRock’s over 1,500 institutional clients – which include corporate and public pensions, endowments and foundations, and sovereign wealth funds – would be able to trade bitcoin through the asset manager’s integrated investment software, Aladdin, one of the people reportedly said.A second person familiar with the matter reportedly said that BlackRock was interested in getting “hands-on with outright crypto” and was “looking at providers in the space.”A third person reportedly commented that there is a working group of “approximately 20 or so” evaluating bitcoin and cryptocurrency inside BlackRock. “They see all the flow that everyone else is getting and want to start making some money from this,” the person added.BlackRock’s chief executive officer Larry Fink said in May of last year that the asset manager was studying bitcoin to determine whether it could offer countercyclical benefits, according to a Reuters report. The executive also said that cryptocurrencies could potentially play a role in long-term investing as an asset class similar to gold.In 2021, the asset manager tiptoed into bitcoin investing through derivatives-based products traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Last month, BlackRock filed with the SEC to offer an exchange-traded fund that would invest in companies involved in the “development, innovation, and utilization of blockchain and crypto technologies,” reported Bloomberg.BlackRock also owns a significant stake in the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, MicroStrategy, whose CEO Michael Saylor is a vocal bitcoin bull.

2022-02-09T12:07:18-05:00,"The entrepreneur, futurist and technologist believes that Bitcoin has the potential to uplift every human being on Earth.Bitcoin equals abundance and can uplift every man, woman, and child in the world, according to serial entrepreneur, technologist, New York Times best-selling author, and TED Speaker Peter Diamandis in an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine.“Bitcoin is digitized currency and energy, and it is going to dematerialize a lot of institutions and demonetize and democratize access to this,” Diamandis said. “We’re gonna have regulatory challenges and institutional challenges for some time to come, but there’s a tipping point, at which point it’s irreversible.”Diamandis explained that historically, exponential breakthroughs in different areas of society have shared a set of characteristics, namely their ability to be deceptive, disruptive, and digitized at first, which enables them to then demonetize, dematerialize, and democratize old technology in favor of new developments.“Capital is energy, bitcoin is energy, it’s all energy,” he added. “It’s about where you put that energy to work, and a lot of the work I do is about creating a better world. I fundamentally believe that the world’s biggest problems are the world’s biggest business opportunities.”Diamandis said he had always been curious about space and space travels, and despite going to Harvard Medical School after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in molecular genetics and aeronautics, he had the dream of becoming an astronaut.However, while in Medical School, Diamandis learned through his network at the time that astronauts don’t travel to space as much as he had thought. Only half the astronauts get to ever travel to space, and among those who do, they only get to do a space flight about two times in their career on average, a discovery that led Diamandis to explore space through the private sector.Diamandis founded Zero Gravity Corporation (Zero-G) to give people the opportunity to experience zero gravity for about 25 seconds in a specially modified Boeing 727 aircraft. In 2007, Diamandis and Zero-Geven flew renowned physicist and the world’s expert in gravity Stephen Hawking to experience firsthand the laws of physics that he spent his life studying.Diamandis also founded the XPRIZE Foundation, which initially sought to incentivize private space exploration by putting out a $10 million prize for the construction of a ship with private capital that could transport three adults up to one hundred kilometers of altitude, land, and be able to repeat the flight with the same ship within two weeks. In 2004, SpaceShipOne won the XPRIZE, and the technology used in the spaceship was later licensed by Richard Branson to create Virgin Galactic.Today, XPRIZE has launched over $300 million in global competitions to address humanity’s greatest challenges: from teaming up with Elon Musk to launch a $100 million prize to combat climate change through gigaton carbon removal, to longevity and creating a $100 million prize focused on age reversal.“There are two, maybe three natural ties to Bitcoin,” Diamandis said, referring to his current search for developments in health and science that could extend humans’ lifespan. “What store of value are you using to maintain your wealth over a century’s timeframe?”Diamandis first heard about Bitcoin between 2010 and 2011, but he wouldn’t take a deep dive into the digital currency until 2014. Shortly after, he wrote a blog post saying he would sell all of his gold to buy bitcoin.“I’m a fan of the way Michael Saylor puts it, and I do believe that Bitcoin equals abundance in many ways,” Diamandis said. “As we’re uplifting every man, woman and child, unless they have a financial system that is available and accessible to them independent of what regime is in power, they can’t build wealth or hope for a better future.”In Diamandis’ opinion, Bitcoin has a “first in line opportunity” to become the dominant currency in space as society moves off planet Earth to conquer other planets.“I think we’re going to start to see a large number of populations and individuals begin to adopt [bitcoin] and we’ll see those pioneers like Michael Saylor and Jack Dorsey who are going to be on the front lines,” Diamandis said.“The old guard will fall in line or be disrupted,” he added."
2022-02-09T12:04:41-05:00,"The Russian government published a document on Tuesday night outlining principles for regulating bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the country.Russia will follow the Ministry of Finance’s suggestion to regulate bitcoin and cryptocurrencies instead of banning them as previously recommended by its central bank.The Russian government published a document on its official website on Tuesday night that outlines the rationale behind the decision and what plans for the legislation could look like, marking a consensus reached with a Bank of Russia that for weeks vouched to outlaw trading and mining completely.The Russian government wants to remove cryptocurrencies from the regulatory “gray” area they are currently in and integrate them into the financial system while “protecting the rights and interests of the investors” while dividing them between “qualified” and “non-qualified” investors, the document said.On January 20, the Bank of Russia proposed a blanket ban on the mining and usage of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, citing concerns that the activities could pose risks to the country’s financial stability. The Ministry of Finance opposed the central bank’s suggestion on January 25, warning that prohibiting bitcoin mining and trading entirely could lead to Russia lagging in innovating in the technology industry.On January 26, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a meeting with government officials that despite the risks warned by the central bank, the country had some competitive advantages in bitcoin mining due to its power surplus and trained workforce. Putin also asked the two entities to reach an agreement regarding the direction of Bitcoin regulation in Russia.In the two days following Putin’s comments, the Russian government drafted a roadmap for cryptocurrency legislation that would encourage developments in the industry while ensuring regulators could enforce restrictions and collect due taxes on transactions.The new document published yesterday reflects that intention as it realizes that Bitcoin cannot be stopped and instead seeks to put laws and restrictions in place to empower watchdogs and ensure the government gets the taxes owed by citizens and businesses.State efforts will also include licensing exchanges and banks interested in providing Bitcoin services to ensure they have “liquidity cushions,” the document said. Only financial institutions that get a license will have the right to open cryptocurrency-related accounts for individuals.The document also provisions the usage of a “Transparent Blockchain” monitoring system, which will identify and classify people, organizations, and wallets that use, sell or deal with cryptocurrencies in Russia. Transparent Blockchain can create models between different transactions and scan the internet and the darknet to reveal wallets connected to suspicious activities, including money laundering, terrorism financing, and weapon distribution in the country. It appears individuals will be able to use self-custody wallets but would need to register it with the Transparent Blockchain beforehand to connect the wallet to the person using it.Foreign exchanges interested in providing cryptocurrency services in Russia would also need to abide by local regulations, which include the need to have a representative in Russia and implement a system to prevent customers from withdrawing funds into wallets not registered with the Transparent Blockchain system.The new Russian regulation would treat Bitcoin similar to a foreign currency, according to a report by local newspaper Kommersant. At least part of the new legislation is expected to come into effect in the second half of 2022 or by next year, the report said.– With assistance by Andrew Fischer."

However, most users may begin their bitcoin journey with a Lightning wallet in the future,” the statement said. “Lightning will cater to this majority with faster settlement speed, lower fees, and more user-friendly payment formats than on-chain. Version 2 of the Guide focuses on building these types of non-custodial Lightning products that people will come to rely on in the future.”The Bitcoin Design Community, an open group of over 2,400 product designers, developers, and creatives that started as a Spiral initiative in the summer of 2020 to solve bitcoin design challenges, will host a Twitter space on Wednesday to discuss the launch of the Bitcoin Design Guide’s new version.Version 2 isn’t the guide’s last iteration, as the Design Community is expected to continue to both maintain and update it, according to the statement. However, future updates will most likely be smaller, more focused revisions that improve specific areas. They may include improvements in product focus sections, better navigation in the guide’s structure, and greater accessibility for bitcoin wallets to cater to a broader set of users, the statement said.The Design Community is always open to new contributors who want to help improve the Bitcoin user experience.

2022-02-08T22:30:00-05:00,"January was the largest month for bitcoin exchange outflows since September 2021.The below is from a recent edition of the Deep Dive, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.As we’ve discussed in previous Daily Dives, March 2020 was a significant catalyst and turning point for bitcoin. We can see that in the behavior of exchange balances which have shown consistent net outflow over the last two years. The two most recent periods of significant inflows were right before both 2021 bitcoin local price tops. These tops in April and November coincided with the previous month showing net exchange inflows of bitcoin in both March and October. January was the largest outflow month since September 2021. Keeping an eye on exchange flow dynamics can help us track demand sentiment and when that is fundamentally changing for market participants.Source: GlassnodeThe 90-day cumulative exchange flow has consistently moved with price over the last year. In the chart below, the right-hand side axis is reversed to show how a decreasing net exchange flow correlates with a rising price and vice versa. What we’ve seen in January is a turning point in the 90-day cumulative netflow with more bitcoin flowing out of exchanges. This signals increased buying demand over the last month and we’ve seen bitcoin price follow suit over the last few days. This is happening while we’re also seeing accumulation trends in long-term holders and whales over the last few weeks.Source: GlassnodeLooking at the 30-day change in exchange balances, we’ve seen a strong deceleration over the last two weeks. Source: GlassnodeAnother way to view exchange volume dynamics is to look at the net exchange flow relative to estimates for adjusted supply. Adjusted supply removes coins that haven’t moved in seven years which is an assumption to account for Satoshi’s coins and lost coins. Current adjusted supply is approximately 15.58 million bitcoin, 82.2% of the circulating supply. "
2022-02-08T21:30:00-05:00,"Is isn't every day that Bitcoin's value proposition is portrayed so clearly and accurately on the mainstream stage.The below is a direct excerpt of Marty's Bent Issue #1158: ""Mainstream Monday."" Sign up for the newsletter here.Things are escalating quickly. On Friday we highlighted the fact that many individuals turned to Tallycoin, a service that makes it very easy to spin up a crowdfund campaign that uses Bitcoin to allow those running the campaign to receive funds in a no-custodial manner. Wholly eliminating the risk of having funds frozen and/or seized because a government or the corporation hosting the campaign doesn't agree with the cause. Since the campaign started it has raised more than 10 BILLION sats, or ~$460,000 at current prices.The buzz around the campaign picked up steam over the weekend. So much buzz that it caught the eye of Tucker Carlson, who hosts one of the most popular nightly shows on mainstream corporate media.Regardless what you think about the corporate media generally or Tucker Carlson personally, it isn't every day that Bitcoin's value prop is portrayed so clearly and accurately on this type of stage.""They're turning to cryptocurrency. Tallycoin, for example, is a small crowdfunding service that uses Bitcoin. It's not controlled by banks. That's the point. They're hosting a fundraiser for the truckers. Now why is this appealing? No one can steal the money. No government can pressure anyone to turn the money over because governments don't control crypto. Bitcoin goes from Person A to Person B and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two.It's pretty appealing. And you can imagine the long-term consequences here. If the people in charge in this country and in Canada want to make the US Dollar irrelevant, they'll keep acting like this and soon it will be. Either way it's becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold that technology has on our human rights is decentralization [...]""A very powerful message was just broadcast to millions of people across the US and the world. I expect this trend of high signal Bitcoin coverage to increase over time as governments become more and more desperate.While Bitcoin being in the spotlight on Tucker Carlson did wonders for mainstream awareness of the value prop instead of hyper focus on price volatility, there was another action that will do wonders for adoption and utility; Cash App rolling out the ability for all of their tens of millions of users to send sats over the Lightning Network.The number one finance app in the app store is making sure it is staying up to date on cutting edge technology that enables people to send small and large amounts of sats instantly and cheaply when compared to on-chain transactions. While it is probably true that many Cash App users currently ignore the Bitcoin page, what is important is that Cash App is building bitcoin products that will enable their users to reap the utility of the network when they are ready. Some will realize they are ready to use Bitcoin under their own volition. Most will be forced to realize the utility of the network due to encroachment on civil liberties that pushes them into the network's hand.By enabling the Lightning Network on the app, Cash App is increasing the amount of people who will be able to take self custody of their sats due to the fact that users with less sats who are less likely to make on-chain transactions when fees are high (which they haven't been for some time) can now do so via the Lightning Network.Increased awareness and tooling is a great way to start the week."
2022-02-08T19:00:00-05:00,"As bitcoin reduces the traditional usage of financial advisors, their role may shift to help facilitate wealth preservation.Many Bitcoiners may have a sour taste in their mouth when they think of financial advisors. Maybe it’s because they repeatedly tell their loved ones that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or worthless. Being wrong for years, and refusing to admit it the entire time, makes Bitcoiners hesitant to think highly of advisors.And to be frank, many financial advisors likely don’t think very highly of Bitcoiners. Many advisors don’t buy into the HODL philosophy: “You think all you have to do is buy bitcoin and hold it for a decade and you will become fabulously wealthy? It can’t be that easy. I went to school and took all these tests proving how that can’t be true!”But maybe it really is that easy for Bitcoiners. Traditional financial asset prices have gone parabolic over the last 18 months, and valuations are growing. Take a look at the broader stock market. Using the valuation metric known as the Shiller P/E ratio, stocks are the most expensive they’ve ever been with the exceptions being the months leading up to the Great Depression in 1929 and during the dotcom bubble of 2000. Real estate finds itself in a similar boat of elevated valuations. And don’t even get me started on fixed income.All of this and more might be leading to the perfect investment case for bitcoin. Bitcoin, at a roughly $800 billion market cap at time of writing, is a puddle next to lakes and oceans of global assets. The number varies depending on who you ask, but let’s peg global assets at $500 trillion (conservatively). With bitcoin being the best store of value the world has ever seen, it’s not crazy to think it will continue gaining share in its addressable market — its dollar price per coin increasing at an impressive clip along the way.So what’s the deal? Why does it seem like so few financial advisors are waking up to Bitcoin and instructing their clients on the actions they should take? Today I will discuss what may be holding financial advisors back and a look ahead to the future of the financial advisor role in a hyperbitcoinized world.Financial advisors manage an estimated $90 trillion of global assets. The amount of these assets that fall under the bitcoin (or even the broader term “crypto”) umbrella is peanuts. In fact, I’ve anecdotally heard many clients don’t even bother to inform their financial advisor about their digital asset holdings. And why would they? According to the RIA Digital Assets Council, only 8% of financial advisors can adequately explain these assets.To explain this fact, you must look at the incentives for a financial advisor to adopt Bitcoin into their practice. Right now, there aren’t very many.A combination of stocks, bonds, and a handful of alternative funds that track precious metals or real estate is a financial advisor’s business. And business is good. The industry has undergone a large shift over the past couple of decades, into charging their clients percentage fees based on their assets under management (AUM), rather than charging commissions on each trade. As long as the markets keep rising, so do advisors’ paychecks. Look back on the stock market’s performance and you will realize that having a successful financial planning practice has been very lucrative. As the old saying goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.Think about your own rabbit hole experience. How many dozens or even hundreds of hours have you spent consuming Bitcoin material? And you still wouldn’t consider yourself an expert. Now think about an advisor attempting to go through this process with an entire client base. Clients of advisors don’t need to be so orange-pilled that they insert laser eyes on their Twitter profiles, sure, but they also need to make sure that their clients know enough about bitcoin to HODL their stack, and also to abstain from threatening to sue when bitcoin inevitably enters a bear market. This is especially true if the client wasn’t fully “on board” in the first place. Lastly, the bridge for advisors to incorporate bitcoin into their client holdings is still under construction. There are plenty of blueprints out there and it seems like I’m hearing about more solutions on a regular basis. As it stands now though, it’s hard to purchase real bitcoin UTXOs for a client and get paid for it as the advisor. I have hopes of this changing very soon, which is encouraging.In a fiat world with inflation, high taxes and boom-and-bust cycles, you may need to be a professional at managing your assets properly or you need to hire someone to do it for you. Bitcoin and a sound money environment can heavily reduce the importance of being an expert just so you don’t lose all of your purchasing power before you die. This will force the financial advisor market to consolidate heavily.Currently, financial advisors don’t have much opportunity cost to compete with. Opportunity cost, in this case, would be the cost of not investing in a “diversified portfolio.” Rather than invest, the other choice for millions is to hold on to their dollars in a bank account, free of volatility. Nearly everyone knows this is a losing strategy today, forcing the masses to invest in risk assets.When that opportunity cost transitions from depreciating fiat to appreciating bitcoin, this will turn into a much more difficult cost-benefit analysis for advisors to overcome. A populace that can simply hold their currency without worry of debasement has substantially less demand for portfolio construction than those forced to invest their capital in risk assets just to outpace the rate of inflation.Rent-seeking activities employed by many advisors will come to an end. Nihilistic index investing - throwing assets into a diversified portfolio with no purpose - will become less and less accepted. Buying bonds just because they are historically viewed as safe investments doesn’t make sense when most come with a negative real yield. And so on.But there are truly great financial advisors out there now, who provide value outside of the percentage return printed on their clients’ statements, who thrive today and will continue to do so. These advisors not only know a thing or two about investments, but are also well-versed in estate planning, various types of insurance, and tax mitigation.This sort of expertise is beneficial to the overall health of a financial plan. Knocking your investments out of the park doesn’t do much good if you fumble a taxable event or your assets don’t pass to your desired heir at death and the courts get involved. The great advisors work together with their clients’ tax accountants and attorneys to ensure the plan is firing on all cylinders. I believe financial advisors will play a large role in onboarding the next tens of millions of users in the western world to the Bitcoin network. Advisors are the gatekeepers of a majority of their clients’ assets. The asymmetric investment opportunity provided by bitcoin could make for the ideal asset to complement - potentially even hedge - expensive stocks and fixed income.Clients will start to seek out advice on how to best utilize their bitcoin stack. Advisors will be expected to clearly demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of areas:·  Does it make sense for clients to take out a mortgage using a portion of their stack as collateral?·  Will advisors be assisting their clients in multisig setups with a third-party provider?·  Should clients participate in peer-to-peer lending protocols to earn extra yield?·  Which mobile or desktop wallet makes the most sense for them?A few concepts which advisors and the general population will need to be accustomed to down the road are portfolios denominated in satoshis (aka sats), securities trading on top of Bitcoin and/or sidechains, and “cash is trash” transitioning to “just stack sats,” to name a few.And those are changes that I, for one, am very excited to experience.I owe a massive thank you to Andy Flattery for providing feedback on this article.

2022-02-08T17:00:00-05:00,"A changing of the guard is standard for fiat currencies — but bitcoin is set to supplant them all.Image Source: Bitrawr.If the last 700 years are any indication, reserve currencies have a shelf life of roughly 100 years. The U.S. dollar (USD) officially became the world reserve currency 77 years ago (Bretton Woods, 1944). Arguably, USD was the reserve as far back as the late 1920s.Source: “Will a Digital Gold Rush Save America’s Economy?” Cryptokek Blog.From a historical timeline perspective, the USD is in the twilight of its reserve status. Couple that with the fact that the United States is also expanding the money supply exponentially (devaluing the purchasing power of the existing supply of USD in the process), and to put it politely, this growth rate is unsustainable.For the record, the U.S. Federal Reserve is not operating in isolation. Most major central banks across the globe are following this trend. Examples include the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Japan (POJ) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to name a few. Frankly, the majority of major central banks are racing one another to see who can debase their currencies the quickest. Source: Haver Analytics.Stanley Druckenmiller, who is considered a legendary investor in part due to his study of history and macroeconomics, thinks the USD will lose reserve currency status within 15 years.""I can't find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with economic circumstances, not one."" — Stanley DruckenmillerSo, if the USD has a shelf life partially due to historical precedence and partially due to fiscal irresponsibility (overprinting of the money supply), what comes next? What replaces the USD? Another fiat currency? It's possible, but my guess is the days of trusting a centralized party to maintain a stable supply of a currency have come and gone. Why trust, when you can just verify? An argument could be made that gold is today’s reserve asset as it is held by the majority of central banks. For me, gold is the past, while Bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin is decentralized, easily verifiable, immutable, divisible with a known supply and is easily amalgamated into an ever-increasing digitizing global economy. Bitcoin is already legal tender in El Salvador, a status that will be difficult for gold to parallel based on its transportation and divisibility limitations. There is a groundswell of Bitcoin adoption happening from different sectors of the economy. Retail, institutions, governments, pension funds, REITS and banks are all accumulating bitcoin. The diversity of accumulation produces “game theory” adoption, accumulation which is occurring far quicker than most would have predicted. For example, El Salvador became the first government to make bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. Today, there are more residents with Bitcoin wallets than traditional bank accounts. As of October 2021, exports of goods grew 34% in 2021 in El Salvador, while gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to be greater than 10% in 2021, making El Salvador one of the fastest growing economies in central America. Source: @DylanLeClair_El Salvador continues to acquire bitcoin at a fast pace, now owning approximately 1,220 bitcoin at the time of writing this article. Bitcoin adoption is an accumulation race. The thing is, most do not realize that the gun has already gone off and the race has started. Ask Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy if they plan to sell, let alone stop accumulating more bitcoin.From a government level, Laos mines bitcoin. They expect to earn $190 million dollars from bitcoin mining in 2022. Tonga is actively drafting legislation to make bitcoin legal tender in the fall of 2022. Panama, Zimbabwe and Ukraine are all looking into possible adoption. Singapore seeks to become a Bitcoin hub. ""We think the best approach is not to clamp down or ban these things,"" said Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The president of El Salvador is currently in Turkey, the first G20 country to experience near hyperinflation. I would guess Nayib Bukele would bring up the benefits that adopting bitcoin as legal tender could do for the Turkish people. For every case like China, which chose to close its doors to Bitcoin, there are two other countries ready to embrace it. You cannot ban Bitcoin, a country can only choose to ignore it, but Bitcoin is not going away. Ignore at your peril. Bulgaria owns 213,518 bitcoin, Ukraine owns 46,351, Finland 1,981 and El Salvador, at the time of writing, 1,220.Screenshot from time of writing.

Nigeria and Turkey are two prime examples. Grassroots citizen adoption (retail) is taking hold in countries all over the world. In 2020, per the Statista global survey, 32% of citizens in Nigeria, 21% in Vietnam, 20% in the Philippines and 16% in Turkey and Peru have indicated they have used or owned “cryptocurrencies.”Source: Statista. Corporate accumulation is also taking place. As of June 2021, 34 public companies collectively hold over 213,000 bitcoin. MicroStrategy and Tesla being the largest. The majority of companies who have adopted bitcoin have done so in the last 18 months.Screenshot from time of writing.

Twitter has enabled tipping via the Bitcoin Lightning Network. One of the most prominent U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITS), SL Green Realty Corp. (NYC Office REIT), has dipped their toes into bitcoin with a $10 million investment in a bitcoin fund. Banks are another corporate sector actively embracing bitcoin after trying to ignore and fight the asset for years. Banks make their money by lending out their assets. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has enabled 6 million of its customers to buy bitcoin. Banks must choose to adopt bitcoin or risk becoming irrelevant.Pension funds and insurance companies are also beginning to gain exposure to bitcoin. The Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRRF) in partnership with NYDIG has purchased $25 million in bitcoin (and ether) in October 2021. MassMutual also purchased $100 million in bitcoin in December 2020.The reason why pension funds and insurances are drawn to bitcoin is because they need to save their monetary energy (purchasing power) for the future. With inflation levels at decade highs, cash savings (in fiat) are being devalued. These funds are forced to take on riskier investments in search of higher yields, to maintain their purchasing power that is being devalued through inflation.Holding bitcoin is simpler, as bitcoin enables the ability to save due to its deflationary nature.The toothpaste (Bitcoin adoption) can't go back in the tube. Adoption has grown to a saturation level (in terms of scale and diversity) which makes a future bitcoin standard for the world inevitable. The majority of the world has blinders on and cannot see this or the groundswell of adoption and accumulation taking place.

The miner deposited all of the bitcoin it mined in January into custody; it held 6,373 bitcoin as of January 31, up from 5,296 BTC in the previous month.In addition to operating its own mining farms, Core Scientific also provides hosting services to a group of customers that amount to 7.1 EH/s. In total, the miner operates over 14 EH/s of hashrate capacity.Core Scientific mined more than 1,000 bitcoin for the second month in a row despite having powered down its mining operations once a week on average during January in response to weather conditions that put a strain on the grids used by the miner, CEO Mike Levitt said in a statement Monday.“We are committed to curtailing mining activities to ensure the stability and performance of the electrical grids in our communities,” he added.Big bitcoin miners often cooperate with state power grids to ensure a balance between supply and demand by being a baseload consumer that guarantees a stable demand for the grid’s energy. However, when an energy producer’s output is unable to match energy demand, miners often shut down part or all of their operations to ensure a stable grid.Earlier this month, publicly listed bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain shut down most of its operations in Texas to save power as cold weather put up the biggest test of the state’s power grid since last year’s blackouts, according to a Bloomberg report.Core Scientific said its electrical curtailments in January amounted to over 1,100 megawatt-hours (MWh) as it powered down a portion of its operations on four separate occasions."
2022-02-08T13:22:31-05:00,"Law enforcement has seized over $3.6 billion in bitcoin of the total $4.5 billion drained in the 2016 Bitfinex hack.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement Tuesday that it had recovered billions of dollars worth of bitcoin stolen in a 2016 hack of Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange affiliated with the world’s biggest stablecoin, Tether.In the largest financial seizure ever, law enforcement has supposedly seized over $3.6 billion in bitcoin out of the total $4.5 billion drained in the hack as it arrested a couple in Manhattan Tuesday morning for an alleged conspiracy to launder the stolen coins. The bitcoin stack was valued at about $71 million at the time of the hack, the DOJ said. The two individuals are scheduled to appear in federal court in the afternoon.“Today’s arrests, and the department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions. Thanks to the meticulous work of law enforcement, the department once again showed how it can and will follow the money, no matter what form it takes.”According to the DOJ, the seizure was possible through court-authorized search warrants of the couple’s online accounts, which gave special agents access to files containing the private keys that controlled the Bitcoin wallet used by the couple and allowed law enforcement to sweep more than 94,000 bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex.“In a methodical and calculated scheme, the defendants allegedly laundered and disguised their vast fortune,” Chief Jim Lee of IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) said in a statement. “IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit special agents have once again unraveled a sophisticated laundering technique, enabling them to trace, access and seize the stolen funds, which has amounted to the largest cryptocurrency seizure to date, valued at more than $3.6 billion.”Bitfinex said in a statement that it had been cooperating with the DOJ since its investigation began and will continue to do so.“If Bitfinex receives a recovery of the stolen bitcoin, as described in the UNUS SED LEO token white paper, Bitfinex will, within 18 months of the date it receives that recovery use an amount equal to 80% of the recovered net funds to repurchase and burn outstanding UNUS SED LEO tokens,” per the statement. “These token repurchases can be accomplished in open market transactions or by acquiring UNUS SED LEO in over-the-counter trades, including directly trading bitcoin for UNUS SED LEO.”According to Bitfinex’s website, “UNUS SED LEO is a utility token designed to empower the Bitfinex community and provide utility for those seeking to maximize the output and capabilities of the Bitfinex trading platform.”"
2022-02-08T09:28:16-05:00,"Bitcoiners raised more than twelve bitcoin, worth over $543,000 for Canadian freedom truckers since GoFundMe suspended their campaign.It’s been almost two weeks since the first trucks arrived in Canada’s capital of Ottawa, setting off what has turned into a global celebration, a freedom rally, nonviolent resistance or a “nationwide insurrection,” depending on your point of view.The City of Ottawa has declared a state of emergency, is bringing in police officers from other cities to assist and is arresting anyone helping a trucker. Last night, police started confiscating fuel. ""The police made a tactical mistake tonight by confiscating fuel. That fuel is inconsequential and does not impact our ability to keep trucks in place,"" tweeted on the ground protest organizer and Bitcoin activist, Nobody Caribou. ""They have awakened a beast by showing their corruption on a world stage. Much love to every person who maintained composure.""Clearly local and federal politicians are hoping the trucks will leave soon, but in an interview with Canadian Bitcoin podcaster John Vallis, Nobody Caribou said the protests are not even close to being over yet.On the ground, Nobody Caribou has a team of organizers working with him gathering information and communicating with truckers who are planning to stay as long as it takes to bring the changes they want:In a press conference this past Sunday, truck convoy organizers said they’re here to stay and they have raised over $4 million on the fundraising site GiveSendGo — which they signed up after GoFundMe froze their funds.They also said at that point that they had received “$300,000 in bitcoin donations.”GoFundMe was the original fundraising choice of the truckers before making the move to fundraising platform GiveSendGo because, after raising almost 10 million in donations, GoFundMe froze the truckers account at the request of Ottawa’s mayor. Well-known philosopher and scholar Jordan Peterson has been tweeting out his support for the truckers and commented about the GoFundMe reversal stating: ""The theft of GoFundMe donations to the truckers was the single worst act of political corruption I have ever witnessed in Canada.""The sense of outrage over the unfairness of this has only helped bitcoin organizer Nobody Caribou, and his committee who have received 12.4 BTC to date from over 4,300 donors.A committee of five bitcoin advocates — Bitcoiner Greg Foss, YouTuber BTC Sessions, Nobody Caribou, author Jeff Booth and Bull Bitcoin CEO Francis Pouliot — have organized bitcoin fundraising using Twitter and fundraising site Tallycoin.Committee member Foss told Bitcoin Magazine that donations to the official bitcoin wallet will be anonymous and safe. The donations are being stored in a multisig wallet, so in order to access the donated funds the wallet requires three out of five key signatures to release any funds.One of the committee members is in contact with the truckers organizers on the ground in Ottawa and will be the liaison for dispersing funds.On a podcast last night, BTC Sessions and Nobody Caribou said they are considering the best way to disperse funds. The truckers are well organized and are receiving donations so it may be that a kind of truckers endowment fund to finance lawyers may be the way to go.The committee is hoping to produce a short how-to video to show the process to send bitcoin donations for the truckers.Meanwhile the City of Ottawa has been unsuccessful in finding companies who will tow away trucks, according to the CBC:“CBC spoke to multiple towing companies across Ontario, and while many weren't willing to be interviewed, several sources said that the companies contracted by the City of Ottawa were refusing to tow trucks involved with the demonstration. The city would not confirm or deny this, saying only that its bylaw department 'uses several contracted services to assist with towing vehicles throughout the city.'""The protestors' pivot to Bitcoin has made it clear that shutting down centralized donation services will not be enough for officials to force and end to this standoff. How far Bitcoin can take the cause is yet to be seen."
2022-02-08T08:52:41-05:00,"The banking giant said Bitcoin is nearing a “hyper-adoption phase” similar to the internet in the mid-to-late 1990s.It is not too late to invest in bitcoin, said multinational financial services giant Wells Fargo in a Monday report, drawing parallels between the adoption rates of the internet in the 1990s and that of cryptocurrencies today.Wells Fargo’s global investment strategy team explained in the report that Bitcoin’s over 200% annualized gains since its first transaction in 2010 often lead some investors to think that it may be too late to join the party. However, the big bank disagrees.“We understand the ‘too late to invest’ argument but do not subscribe to it,” the report said, explaining that similar to the internet in the mid-to-late-1990s, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies “could soon exit the early adoption phase and enter an inflection point of hyper-adoption.”Moreover, Wells Fargo believes that Bitcoin’s adoption rate will be even faster than that of the internet because “each new digital invention rides the coattails of the digital infrastructure already built,” as evidenced by the steeper rise in smartphone adoption.Technology S curves.

In the U.S., for instance, users can buy BTC directly from Cash App, the popular financial services application by Block, and withdraw to a bitcoin wallet of their choice. Even though there is a learning curve with self-custodying bitcoin, the positives outweigh the negatives in the long run since it is the only way to benefit from Bitcoin’s value proposition of complete financial freedom."
2022-02-07T18:00:00-05:00,"Bitcoiners understand that ideas are best built upon in a system that does not restrict innovation.*Special thanks to Jeff Booth for discussing these ideas with the author.In his 2020 book, “The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation Is the Key to an Abundant Future,” Jeff Booth describes two opposing forces at the core of our economy: fiat monetary debasement (i.e., money printing) and technological advancement. Monetary debasement is inflationary, as prices rise when more dollars, euros, etc., chase after the same number of goods and services. Technological advancement, by contrast, is deflationary, as over time technological breakthroughs allow for goods and services to be produced and distributed at higher volume and lower cost. The effects of these opposing forces on price levels somewhat cancel each other out; an increased supply of currency is matched to some degree with an increased supply of goods and services available. Of course, different classes of goods and services are impacted by technological innovation to different degrees, which results in uneven inflation rates across industries. The rate of innovation in the consumer electronics industry, for example, is faster than the rate of monetary debasement, resulting in the net reduction in electronics prices we have all come to enjoy. Technological advancement has had far less impact on housing and higher education, however, which can at least partially explain the rapid inflation in those sectors. As Booth explains, both monetary debasement and technological advancement are exponential in nature. The rate at which governments are printing currency and the rate of technological innovation are increasing every year. Booth persuasively argued that monetary debasement has deleterious effects on society, whereas innovation-driven deflation has the positive effects of, for example, mitigating wealth inequality and poverty. In essence, monetary debasement serves as a hidden regressive tax on the population, redistributing the wealth generated by productivity gains to the government via seigniorage and to wealthy asset holders via asset inflation. If this monetary debasement were curtailed, Booth argues, the entire population would enjoy the benefits of technological advancement in the form of plummeting prices on goods and services. If you have not yet read Booth’s book, you should.This article expands on Booth’s work by considering the impact of monetary debasement and technological innovation on the economics of the U.S. patent system. The modern patent framework was established in 1952. Much has changed in the last 70 years, both in terms of U.S. monetary policy and the state of technology. The United States of 1952 was still on a gold standard, preventing the government from debasing the currency as it is doing rampantly today. The rate of technological change was also much slower in 1952 than it is now, as the country was just beginning to enter the computer age and globalization was a far ways off. In view of these massive changes in our economy which are continuing to unfold, it is the author’s opinion that the U.S. patent system is becoming increasingly unable to serve its purpose of promoting innovation and economic growth. A return to sound money (i.e., ending monetary debasement by adopting a bitcoin standard) would resolve at least some of the issues plaguing the current patent system. Alternatively or additionally, reforming the patent laws could bring them into closer alignment with the exponential economy we now live in.A patent is a legal right granted by the federal government to the creator of a new and useful invention. It allows the inventor to prevent others from practicing — that is, making, using, selling, importing or offering for sale — the invention during a defined period of time following the patent’s grant. Every patent is published, providing the public not only with notice of the inventor’s exclusionary rights, but also with a description of what the invention is and how to make and use it.The purpose of the patent system is twofold. First, it provides innovators with an incentive to expend resources on research, development and marketing that could otherwise be unprofitable. Without the exclusionary rights provided by a patent, copiers would quickly reverse engineer innovators’ products to create competing products with the same inventive features. By skipping the resource-intensive process of developing the invention, and riding on the coattails of the innovators’ early efforts to introduce consumers to the technology, copiers would often be able to offer the invention at a lower price than the innovator and take significant market share. Patents prevent this scenario by providing innovators with an exclusive right to use an invention during a patent’s term. Any copier during this time is liable to be sued for patent infringement.The second purpose of the patent system is to incentivize public disclosure of new innovations rather than secrecy. In many instances, an invention cannot readily be reverse engineered by competitors, and so the above-described concern regarding copycats is not applicable. For example, an inventive process of manufacturing a product might not be discernible by examining the product itself. Inventors of such innovations have the option of maintaining their competitive advantage merely by keeping their technology secret (what is known as a “trade secret”), but this is viewed as less socially desirable than patenting because the public is not apprised of the latest technological developments. The patent system incentivizes creators of even inventions that cannot be reverse engineered to disclose their inventions, facilitating further incremental improvements on the technology by others in the field.Although a patent may prevent competitors from using or commercializing a particular product, it is important to recognize that patents relate to technologies rather than specific products. A single product might contain many patented technologies and thus be subject to the exclusionary rights of many different patentees. Consider, for example, a modern car. How many patented technologies does it contain? There are patents pertaining to different aspects of the battery, the computer systems, the heating and cooling systems, the external camera system, the composition of the tires, the engine or electric motors, etc. A car manufacturer must own or license the rights to each of the patents for the technologies it uses, or risk being dragged through the courts in patent infringement lawsuits. Simply owning a patent that covers a particular product does not confer a legal right to make, use or sell that product; it only confers a legal right to prevent others from doing so without permission.Because patents relate to technologies, and because technologies are incremental in nature, a poorly designed patent system can actually impede innovation rather than augment it. If the patent term is too long, for example, pioneers and early innovators in a technological field can exert disproportionate control over (and extract undue profits from) later innovators, thereby discouraging later innovation. Let’s continue with the car hypothetical to illuminate this point. Imagine that Inventor A has a patent on a generic wheel. Inventor B has a patent on a wheel that contains a rubber surface. And Inventor C has a patent on a wheel containing an inflated rubber tire. An automaker wants to introduce a new line of wheels with inflated rubber tires that have reinforced sidewalls and treads. Even though none of Inventors A, B and C contemplated tires with reinforced sidewalls or treads, the automaker’s new wheels would nevertheless practice each of their patents. The automaker would, therefore, need to negotiate a license with each of the prior inventors, and any one of the inventors could block the automaker’s new product by refusing to grant such a license. Faced with these headwinds, the automaker could decide not to develop the new wheels at all, instead opting for existing alternatives. If the patents owned by Inventors A and B had expired, however, the automaker would be more willing to develop the new wheels because it would only require a license from Inventor C. It is, therefore, important for patents to expire within a reasonable time frame to prevent them from choking out later innovation. Patents need only last long enough to provide innovators with an adequate incentive to invest in developing new technologies.The patent system’s capacity to impair innovation is compounded by errors made by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “Patent Office”) during examination. The Patent Office serves as the gatekeeper for the issuance of new patents, allowing patent applications to issue as patents only when they fulfill several criteria:In short, the Patent Office attempts to only allow a patent to be issued when it describes an actual invention and is narrowly and clearly tailored to that invention. Unfortunately, making the correct determination regarding the above criteria is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the Patent Office’s employees evaluating patent applications (known as “examiners”) have limited time to evaluate each application given that over half a million new patent applications are filed every year. As a result, many patents are granted that either do not describe actual inventions, convey exclusionary rights that far exceed the scope of any invention disclosed, and/or are simply vague as to their exclusionary rights. These patents are “invalid” and unenforceable, although one never knows for sure whether a patent is indeed invalid until a court (or in some cases, the Patent Office) issues a judgment finding that it is invalid. When a patent practitioner suspects that a patent would be found invalid if put to the test, the practitioner might refer to the patent as being “low quality.”An abundance of low-quality patents in circulation serves as a further drag on innovation and economic activity because these patents are often used by patentees to extract costly licenses and settlements from manufacturers and other companies that build, sell, or use technology. Proving that a low-quality patent is invalid and hence unenforceable/worthless, or that it does not cover a particular product (i.e., “is not infringed”), typically costs well over $1 million in legal fees, and there is no guarantee of success. As such, many companies opt to pay off holders of low-quality patents despite believing that they have no legal obligation to do so. Acquiring and asserting low-quality patents to extract these nuisance payoffs — what is derogatorily referred to as “patent trolling” — has become a lucrative business model in recent years. Small and start-up companies are often hit hardest by patent trolling because they have limited resources to defend themselves in court and/or pay for licenses. In short, the issuance of significant numbers of low-quality patents impedes innovation and economic growth by ultimately imposing unjustified costs on companies that actually build things, disincentivizing new productive enterprises.A patent system should, therefore, be designed to optimize patent term length (not too short to provide meaningful incentives to innovate but also not so long that later innovation is choked out by a thicket of too many existing patents) and minimize the issuance of low-quality patents. A poorly designed patent system can impair innovation and economic growth to the same extent that a well-designed patent system can augment them.The current term for U.S. patents is 20 years from the time an inventor submits a patent application to the Patent Office. This patent term was modified in 1994 from the patent term provided by the Patent Act of 1952 but is approximately equivalent in total length.2One need not be a historian of economics to understand that it took longer and was more expensive to commercialize new products in 1952 than today. The innovators of 1952 did not have access to, for example, offshore contract manufacturers that adapt quickly to new products and can increase volume rapidly and at low cost. Nor did they have access to today’s responsive supply chains, which are able to bring new products from conception to the shelf in record time. Every aspect of product manufacturing and distribution took longer and was more expensive in 1952.Product marketing and sales were also more challenging in 1952 than they are today. Decades before the internet, innovators educated consumers on new products via print advertising, television advertising, sales representatives, etc. This was a slow and expensive process. Today, intelligent internet algorithms allow consumers to find exactly what they need in seconds, and even anticipate consumers’ needs and desires using targeting advertising. The rise of platforms like Amazon has dramatically reduced the cost of marketing and sales of new products.As Booth explains in his book, these trends will no doubt continue exponentially into the future. Manufacturing facilities will utilize more sophisticated automation equipment and incorporate developing technologies like 3D printing, driving costs down and responsiveness up. Logistics will also employ more automation such as driverless vehicles, reducing transport costs and shipping time. Marketing algorithms will find customers with greater efficiency. Eventually, customers might routinely 3D print new products directly to their homes, reducing the lag between product conception and product sales to near-zero.Not only are the costs and time associated with bringing new products to market decreasing over time, so is the cost of developing new patentable technologies. The increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the invention process has been a hot topic in recent years. These technologies can already perform much of the work classically associated with innovation, and there have even been examples of AI algorithms conceiving of complete inventions. As these technologies continue to develop, the cost of innovating new products will continue to decrease and the speed at which new technologies are developed will continue to increase.And finally, technology is even decreasing the cost associated with transferring and monetizing patents. IBM and IPwe announced in 2021 that they had “plans to begin representing patents as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or digital assets” to “help position patents to be more easily sold, traded, commercialized or otherwise monetized and bring new liquidity to this asset class for investors and innovators.” As patents become more liquid and easily monetized, their value increases.As discussed above, the patent system is designed to provide a financial reward to innovators to incentivize bringing new technologies to market, which it accomplishes by providing inventors with a static 20-year period in which they have exclusive rights to their inventions. If 20 years of exclusivity was sufficient to incentivize innovation in 1952 (which it was, as evidenced by the rapid technology-driven increase in standard of living during the mid-20th century), then today that same exclusivity period is overcompensating innovators. The cost of innovating new products, the cost of bringing those products to market, the cost of marketing those products, and the time needed to bring those products to market (i.e., the payback period) have all plummeted, and the number of new innovations a patent might lay claim to in a given 20-year period has exponentially increased. Yet the 20-year patent term remains essentially unchanged.The failure of the patent system to adapt to exponential technological growth has given rise to the problems associated with unduly long-lived patents discussed above. Whereas in 1952 it might have been reasonable for a patent filed in 1932 to cover follow-on technology developed in 1952, today the calculus is far different. Much less technological development occurred between 1932 and 1952 than occurred between 2002 and 2022, and the cost of innovating was far higher. But because the patent term has not been meaningfully updated, it is not uncommon to see a 2002 patent on some crude telecommunications technology asserted in court against the manufacturers of cutting-edge 5G products and systems. Indeed, because modern technology companies face patents from a full 20 years of rapid technological growth, their potential patent liability in developing new products can be essentially unknowable. This can have the effect of narrowing the rollout of new products to only the largest companies with the resources to navigate and defend against such patent thickets, accelerating consolidation and monopolization.The static 20-year patent term also provides increasing incentives for individuals and companies to file low quality patent applications, further clogging the arteries of the Patent Office and providing patent trolls with ammunition to parasitize future technology companies. As noted above, the Patent Office’s job is to prevent these applications from issuing as patents, but resource constraints in the face of ever-increasing application rates necessarily means that some low-quality patent applications will issue as low-quality patents. The increasing rate of technological development enhances the value of these low-quality patents, as patent trolls looking to assert these patents will see more potential targets during a 20-year period than they would have seen in prior years. Thus, even when a person has an idea that she does not believe is inventive or has immediate commercial value, the 20-year patent term increasingly incentivizes seeking a patent because the patent can be used to extract nuisance payoffs from unforeseen innovators in the distant future. The issuance of low-quality patents has only negative economic effects, ultimately facilitating a transfer of wealth from productive companies to parasitic patent trolls, and thus the static 20-year patent term that rewards seeking low-quality patents is suboptimal.In sum, the architects of the current patent system did not factor in the exponential rate of technological growth, which has over time brought the patent system severely out of alignment with reality. The 20-year patent term now provides excess incentives to innovators at the cost of future innovators, giving rise to several negative effects. Patents from the distant past are now a drag on new innovation. The largest companies are more resilient to patent enforcement, driving monopolization in technology industries. And people are incentivized to seek patent protection for non-inventions, congesting the Patent Office and fueling patent trolls. Amending the patent term to be responsive to exponential technological progress would immediately benefit the economy by mitigating the above-discussed issues. The new rule would provide a schedule of term lengths for newly issued patents in which the terms decrease over time.3 A patent issued in 2030 would have a shorter term than a patent issued in 2022. The patent term lengths would ideally collapse toward zero as humanity approaches the theoretical technological singularity, at which point technology will progress so quickly that the patent system — which currently takes years to issue patents and years to enforce them — will have no hope of keeping pace. Patent law might then be abandoned altogether, leaving first-mover advantage and reputation enhancement as the primary incentives to innovate. Indeed, the costs of innovating, commercializing inventions and finding customers in the distant future will be so low that patent protection might be totally unnecessary. It is well understood in the Bitcoin community, as well as by savvy investors, that a nation’s debasement of its currency by expanding the money supply has enormous impacts on investment activity and outcomes. Seeking a patent is an investment, and thus patent activity and outcomes are also manipulated by monetary debasement. For simplicity, the below discussion refers to economies subject to significant monetary debasement as “inflationary” and economies that have hard money (i.e., hyperbitcoinized economies where prices are governed primarily by deflationary technological progress) as “deflationary.” In an inflationary system, today’s money is essentially guaranteed to decrease in value over time, whereas goods and services will increase in price over time. In a deflationary system, the opposite is true: Today’s money will increase in value over time and goods and services will decrease in price over time. Inflationary systems incentivize speculation (i.e., spending today’s money on assets that will likely appreciate in nominal terms), whereas deflationary systems incentivize saving (i.e., holding today’s money to buy cheaper goods and services in the future when they are more needed).Just as financial markets and real estate can be subject to rampant speculation in inflationary systems, so, too, can patenting activity. Consider, for example, the following hypothetical. A researcher in a company develops a new idea for a car technology and submits a description of that technology to the relevant business manager. The manager must decide whether to file a patent application for the technology. She estimates that the cost of seeking a patent is $20,000, comprising attorney fees and Patent Office filing fees. The company is not planning on developing any new products that would use the technology, and in fact, the manager doubts that any novel aspects of the technology are actually useful. Nevertheless, because the $20,000 in the manager’s budget will decrease in value if unused, and because the car market is expected to increase exponentially in nominal value in the coming 20 years when the patent would be enforceable, the manager decides to move forward with seeking a patent on the technology. Even a low probability that the company can one day extract a nuisance payoff from a competitor makes the patent a worthwhile investment. If the average car in 20 years is expected to cost $500,000, then even a very low probability of extracting some value of the car market can have a high speculative value. The expected inflation in legal costs associated with defending against patent infringement lawsuits further increases the speculative value of the patent, as future competitors will be incentivized to settle frivolous infringement lawsuits rather than defend themselves. Now consider the same hypothetical in a deflationary bitcoinized system. The manager knows that the 0.01 bitcoin required to obtain a patent will increase in purchasing power over the next 20 years, whereas cars will become cheaper and cheaper over that time due to technological advancement. In other words, the present cost of obtaining patent rights 20 years in the future in a deflationary system is extremely high, whereas the potential reward can be very low. Without a clear path for quickly monetizing the technology, such as by implementing it in upcoming products, the manager is more likely to save the bitcoin for a better investment opportunity. Accordingly, inflationary systems incentivize the speculative proliferation of low-quality patents, which clog the Patent Office and result in parasitic patent-trolling activity. Deflationary systems, by contrast, incentivize prudence in patenting decisions, focusing scarce monetary resources on protecting only high-value inventions and reducing the profitability of parasitic patent-trolling. Transitioning from our current inflationary system to a deflationary system based on bitcoin would thus likely heal many of the ailments with the patent system we see today.Many observers have criticized the patent system in recent years as being broken or counter to its own objectives. Patent trolls are a persistent problem for technology companies. Vast patent thickets amassed by the largest corporations can be used to drown out competition from smaller market entrants. And the Patent Office is so inundated with patent applications that it has difficulty keeping pace while assuring that only high-quality applications are issued as patents. The result is that many innovators feel threatened or taxed, rather than empowered, by the patent system.If the author’s thesis is correct, the dysfunction of the present system stems largely — if not entirely — from the fact that it was designed for the U.S. economy of 1952, which is long gone. The 1952 economy was defined by slower technological progress and slower monetary expansion under the gold standard. The patent laws have not meaningfully adapted to these changes, and thus the hand has outgrown the glove.As a Bitcoiner, the author must always ask, “Does bitcoin fix this?” The answer is yes, to some degree, because sound money reduces the incentive to speculate that is at the root of at least some of the patent system’s problems. But even under a bitcoin standard, the patent term awarded to newly issued patents will likely need to decay over time to adjust to the exponential rate of technological progress. If humanity truly is approaching a singularity wherein the rate of technological advancement exceeds our ability to comprehend it, the absurdity of a static 20-year patent duration will eventually become apparent to everyone.As a final note, although this article has focused on the U.S. patent system, there are likely many other examples of legal frameworks that are currently dysfunctional for failing to adapt to monetary debasement and/or accelerating technological progress. Similarly, there are no doubt legal frameworks with more recent origins that are well-adapted to our inflationary system but will become hopelessly dysfunctional under a future deflationary bitcoin standard. The author calls on Bitcoiners with expertise in these various areas to help prepare for a bitcoinized future by analyzing how other existing legal systems will need to be updated.Footnotes1. This discussion of patent law is greatly simplified and excludes jargon to convey only the basic concepts that relate to this article’s thesis.2. The original 1952 patent term was 17 years from the date the patent was issued. Because it was typical for patents to issue a few years after filing, the change to 20 years from patent filing did not materially alter the overall patent term. The change was intended primarily to end a strategic practice by some patent applicants to intentionally keep their patents from issuing as long as possible so they could extend their exclusionary rights into the distant future. This was known colloquially as “patent ambush” using “submarine patents,” referring to the patents’ ability to emerge with a full patent term a decade or more — sometimes multiple decades — after their filing date, unfairly surprising competitors who may have independently developed the patented technology while the application was pending.3. In the author’s experience, the only industry potentially deserving of extended exclusionary rights is pharmaceuticals/therapeutics, due to the costly testing required to prove safety and efficacy for a new drug. The patent system is not needed to provide any such extended rights, however, as the Food and Drug Administration already has its own parallel mechanisms for granting exclusionary rights to drug makers.This is a guest post by Million Plebs.

Instead, the self-directed group of developers, designers, and project managers work together to advance the adoption of bitcoin.The Lightning Development Kit (LDK) is a flexible Lightning implementation geared towards developers who want to integrate Bitcoin’s Lightning Network into their applications frictionlessly. It abstracts away complexities of Lightning, enabling developers to integrate the network easier and faster into their apps.Jack Dorsey said in a fireside chat last week with Michael Saylor, the CEO of software intelligence company MicroStrategy, that having Cash App integrate Lightning through the Spiral’s work was one of the proudest moments of his career.Lightning adoption has skyrocketed since El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in September, prompting users to use the faster payment rails to buy their daily breakfast on McDonald’s or their morning coffee on Starbucks. Despite critics saying that Bitcoin cannot be used as a means of exchange due to its base layer’s slow settlements, Lightning empowers Bitcoin to handle the smallest of payments for little to no cost.Now, all Cash App users can also leverage Lightning to send small payments instantly and for free. However, it seems that Cash App cannot yet receive Lightning transactions itself — only send them."

2022-02-07T10:05:11-05:00,"Statements from Russia and China suggest the two are unified and prepared to evade economic sanctions, with Bitcoin being a potential tool.On February 4, news emerged that Russian President Vladimir Putin had issued a letter to the people of China, published by a local news agency, that detailed ongoing trade between the two countries and mutually-beneficial infrastructure projects. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin also met in Beijing ahead of the opening of the 2022 Winter Olympics, hosted in Beijing, and dropped some heavy conversation onto the wires. Stemming from that meeting, the leaders issued a joint statement that confirmed Russia’s backing of China in its disputes with Taiwan; expressed concerns over a defense alliance led by Australia, the U.K. and U.S.; and criticized the expansion of Nato, among other things.But among all of the geopolitical lines being drawn in the sand by these two leaders, one issue in particular could signal forthcoming attitudes around Bitcoin. Russia and China have been in the crosshairs of many tense political topics, and have both been targets for threats of economic sanctions recently, making it unsurprising that the two neighbors are seeking alliances around trade and scientific development. “We are consistently expanding settlements in national currencies and creating mechanisms to offset the negative impact of unilateral sanctions,” Putin wrote in his letter to the Chinese people. “A major milestone in this work was the signing of an agreement between the Government of Russia and the Government of China on payments and settlements in 2019.”This is coming on the heels of threats to cut Russia off from the SWIFT system that were made just days prior. Russia is particularly well positioned to evade sanctions, considering the treasure trove of forex reserves it holds, valued at north of $600 billion only five months ago. Do these actions implicate interest in a strategy of broader Bitcoin adoption by one, or both, superpowers? It doesn’t seem like a far-off reality. Russia’s Central Bank had suggested a ban on Bitcoin, and Putin (backed by other members of government) pushed back, suggesting that Russia stood to gain advantages with bitcoin and mining, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine late last month. Tangentially, Belarus has signaled interest in keeping its liberal approach to bitcoin only one day prior.To further push the likelihood of implied interest in bitcoin, we need to turn to reading between the lines. China has been under pressure during this energy crisis, along with members of the EU. Of particular note is the drought that has been occurring this winter in China, resulting in warnings of uncharacteristic and unannounced water supply cuts. with the Yunnan province in particular being squeezed by reduced hydropower outputs thanks to the droughts, hitting a major power supplier to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong. Guangdong is heralded as a “powerhouse” of China in terms of trade activity. If the power supplier for such a key source of trade for China has a problem, then President Xi has a problem. With this context, another section of Putin’s letter is particularly telling:“A mutually beneficial energy partnership is being formed between our countries. Along with long-term oil and gas supplies to China, we have plans to implement a number of large-scale joint projects. The construction of four new power units at Chinese nuclear power plants with the participation of Rosatom State Corporation launched last year is one of them. All this significantly strengthens the energy security of China and the Asia region as a whole.”Putin seems to understand the value that bitcoin brings in providing incentives to create expanded and robust power production (by all sources), including the environmental positives that bitcoin mining yields by providing a use case for flare gas. On top of that, bitcoin has likely been proven desirable in its censorship resistance potential in the face of threats by western nations hoping to cut Russia off from the SWIFT system. And, last but not least, there’s the basis of the network’s decentralization. The number of reachable Bitcoin nodes across the globe has been rapidly approaching a daunting 15,000 in number.. Of particular note is that these are only the nodes that are not obfuscated via Tor or other privacy tools, meaning that we have no idea what the concrete number is, but that it is likely higher than this estimated total.Bitcoin continues to prove its value to the world, and it seems safe to say that we can expect more countries to announce interests going forward.

2022-02-07T09:13:14-05:00,"The Freedom Convoy has embraced bitcoin donations after GoFundMe shut down its initial fundraising campaign.Freedom Convoy, a cohort of Canadian truckers protesting for the end of COVID-related mandates in the country and the restoration of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, had received C$10 million ($7.8 million) in donations until its fundraising platform, GoFundMe, froze their funds on Friday alleging violations of its terms of service.“GoFundMe supports peaceful protests and we believe that was the intention of the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser when it was first created,” GoFundMe said in a Friday statement. “We now have evidence from law enforcement that the previous peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity.”“This fundraiser is now in violation of our Terms of Service (Term 8, which prohibits the promotion of violence and harassment) and has been removed from the platform,” the platform said.In this statement, GoFundMe also said donors who wanted a refund had to submit a request until February 19; otherwise, the money would be sent to other “credible and established charities.” After a huge backlash, however, the platform issued an updated statement on Saturday saying that all donations would be automatically refunded to donors.Despite this being a positive change for those expecting refunds after GoFundMe’s abrupt removal, the furnishing of automatic refunds was likely the expectation of many, without the need for such an update..The changes instituted by GoFundMe demonstrate how traditional payment rails can be politicized and stopped at will, most often sidelining movements that defy the status quo of their jurisdiction by cutting off access to donation avenues altogether.For instance, a similar series of events took place in Nigeria in 2020, when the Feminist Coalition, a Nigerian advocacy group formed earlier that year focused on advancing and protecting women’s rights in the country, saw donations meant to help the country’s #EndSARS movement stopped by centralized fundraising platforms. Without a funding source, the movement would sooner or later come to an end; however, the Nigerian group found a sovereign lifeline in bitcoin – something the Canadian truckers have now found as well.At the time of writing, the Freedom Convoy has raised over 8.80 BTC through its bitcoin donations page. Although the page was set up a couple of days before GoFundMe shut down its fundraising, the lifeline came in handy to quickly supercharge the convoy’s efforts in vouching for a wide range of individual freedoms that the truckers claim the Canadian government took away from them.Those interested in supporting the truckers’ protest can gift BTC through the Freedom Convoy’s new donations page, which accepts bitcoin donations on-chain and on the Lightning Network."
2022-02-06T14:00:00-05:00,"A metric posed as a criticism of Bitcoin actually shows extreme energy usage in one example of a legacy company.During the House Hearing On Crypto’s Energy Use And Impact there was a point of opposition provided in the manner of, “number of jobs per unit of electricity consumed.” I’m not nonplussed by the question — I think there’s a fair question to ask relative to our understanding of where our energy is going somewhere in there, and maybe there is some validity to comparing it to our employment figures, I don’t know. But to gain a bearing of understanding around this kind of thinking I wanted to look to compare the energy consumption of one of our favorite companies here in the United States.I chose to look at Microsoft (MSFT). On some quick napkin math I looked at Microsoft’s 2019 employment numbers (144,000), as I could only find data on their energy consumption from 2019.2019’s total energy use, thanks to Microsoft’s 2019 Environmental Sustainability Data Factsheet, comes in at just over 9.2 million megwatt hours (MWh). Which is 9,200 gigawatt hours (GWh), or 9.2 terawatt hours (TWh). Before we attempt to look into the energy consumption and moralization conversation, a quick input from the American Geosciences Institute:“The amount of electricity that a power plant generates over a period of time depends on the amount of time it operates at a specific capacity. For example, if the R. E. Ginna reactor operates at 582 MW capacity for 24 hours, it will generate 13,968 megawatt hours (MWh).”The largest nuke reactor in the world as of January 2020 resides in Japan. Tokyo’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa reactor has a net capacity of just shy of 8,000 MW, so for conversation’s sake we’ll just use that nice, round number. To get our MWh measurement so we can compare production to consumption let’s do the math:8,000 MW output x 24 hours = 192,000 MWh Now we need to get the annual potential output, this metric is not going to necessarily be reliable because nukes cannot operate perpetually. There is very important maintenance along the way in order to ensure that all safety and regulatory guidelines are met. But we’re speaking in hypotheticals here:192,000 MWh x 365 days = 70,080,000 MWh annuallyor70,000 GWhor70 TWhAccording to Power-technology.com that plant produces enough power to support 16 million homes.Here we have Microsoft consuming nearly 13% of that relative output for themselves. And if we wanted to go down the line of thought around “number of jobs per unit electricity consumed” we’d get a figure that looks something like:9.2 million MWh / 144,000 employees = 63.9 MWh per employeeAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration the average household consumes 10,715 kWh per year, at 893 kWh per month. Okay … now my math might be wrong here, so check me. But according to my brain that means that Microsoft’s energy consumption per employee equals that of approximately 4,000 households each.Is this really a metric that Bitcoin’s opponents really want to use to try and argue against supporting the network and asset? Both Microsoft and Bitcoin are providing massive services to tens of millions of people across the world: between facilitating digital communications and operations, to securing purchasing power and providing functionality for cross-border payments and settlement finality that are leaps and bounds improved over the standard today. As a former artist, and academic by passion, all I ask is this: Can we please criticize from honest, even and fair grounds? Can Bitcoin’s opponents throw hypocrisy and ignorance out the window?

2022-02-05T17:00:00-05:00,"With the rise of Bitcoin’s network effects comes the equivalent demise in legacy finance’s network effects.Bitcoin’s price and ecosystem benefit from network effects.As more users join, demand pressure increases the price of bitcoin, which in turn attracts more buyers in a self-reinforcing cycle. Similarly, user growth creates a larger market with more liquidity, incentivizing businesses to provide more services, integrations and security, which then encourages new users to join the more robust ecosystem.Understanding this network effect is important when considering Bitcoin’s place within the greater financial world.Legacy financial systems also benefit from network effects to a degree, as increased user growth enables expansion of financial services, fostering more user growth. As more customers adopt Visa credit cards due to their widespread use as payment options, more merchants are incentivized to integrate with Visa to access customers, thereby enabling more Visa card adoption.Network effects are a powerful driver for growth.However, not all network effects are the same. Each network has its own value proposition, potential growth rate, structural limitations, and barriers to entry and exit. Metcalfe’s Law posits that the value of a telecommunication network is proportional to the square of its nodes. As more users (nodes) join such a network, the number of possible connections increases exponentially, providing an ever-growing incentive for new users to adopt that network. Although Metcalfe’s Law has limitations beyond communication networks, it still helps illustrate the exponential power that network effects have in our increasingly interconnected world.A less-discussed phenomenon of network effects is their decline potential. Just as the increase in the number of nodes can add value to a network exponentially, so too can the decline in the number of nodes reduce the value of the network exponentially.Social giant Facebook has leveraged network effects in its growth, as each additional Facebook user added exponentially more social connection opportunities, thereby enticing more users to join. However, with each user who deletes their Facebook account, the potential number of social connections declines at an exponential pace, a phenomenon I have written on previously. As Facebook users’ news feeds become stale, displaying the same few posts by the same few people, users may abandon the social network due to its diminishing utility, which would make existing users’ news feeds all the more stale in a self-reinforcing cycle.Network effects go both ways.Artwork by Matthew Pettigrew at The Bitcoin Letter.This decline potential of network effects was written about by Game B co-founder Jordan Hall, in his piece entitled The Rise and Fall of Networks. In this piece, Hall outlines how companies that benefited from network effects such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are potentially more fragile than they appear.These companies have reached a level of market dominance, whereby they attract an overwhelming share of new users, further cementing their market dominance. This is a powerful network attractor force, which may seem insurmountable for new market entrants. However, in the face of these powerful network attractor forces Hall articulates a different concept:“Any for-profit entity that is founded on the value of network effects must maximally extract that value to the limit of the network attractor. This produces an ‘extractive repulsor’ force. As the limit is approached, the network becomes poised at fragility.”This value-reducing “extractive repulsor” force on social networks is most obviously seen in the intrusive ads and the selling of user data. As Hall points out, these forces are anti-valued by the users and incentivize them to leave the network. Users do not join a social media site to see ads and have their behaviors tracked or manipulated, rather, those things are tolerated up to a point.Less evident examples of this extractive repulsor force can be seen in the onerous restrictions on network use, reduced customer service, intrusions on user wellbeing, or even social consequences, all of which exert downward pressure on the growth of the network.If too much extractive repulsor force is applied, the network’s growth rate will stop and begin to decline, diminishing its value to its users.This is the Metcalfe-Hall equilibrium. For-profit networks are incentivized to extract value up to the limit of repulsing the network effects, but no further, otherwise, the network risks causing a potentially exponential decline in network value.Hall also points out how the decline of a network can be faster than its rise, since the downfall of a network is now also encumbered by the extractive repulsor force.As users delete their Facebook accounts due to declining social connections, the fact that their newsfeeds are interspersed with intrusive ads will only serve to accelerate abandonment, a point I have written about previously. The precariousness of such a Metcalfe-Hall equilibrium means that for-profit networks that rely on network effects could suddenly begin a downward, self-reinforcing, exponential decline in network users.Gradually, then suddenly.In the context of financial networks, it is worth considering the degree to which network effects attract users and value-extraction repels users.As for-profit entities, legacy financial systems impose extractive repulsor forces in the form of fees, overdraft penalties, and onerous exchange rates. In addition to these forces, there are minimum balance requirements, limited business hours, withdrawal limits, and wait times that encumber the user who seeks to store and exchange value. These things are anti-valued by users, but tolerated to the limit where they remain with the network.Until recently, the Metcalfe-Hall equilibrium within legacy financial systems has been at least partially supported by a lack of alternatives. Whereas a person can delete their Facebook account and take their social lives elsewhere, deleting their bank account or credit card to take their financial lives elsewhere was more difficult.With the growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem for buying, selling, borrowing, lending, and securing value digitally, a new financial network is emerging. This new network offers a completely different approach to fees, wait times, business hours, exchange rates, minimum balances, and withdrawal limits. The marginal user seeking to manage their finances can now do so in an alternate network.Within the payments space, people gravitate towards bigger credit card providers for their convenience, despite fees ranging from 1.3% - 3.5% per transaction (or more in some markets), and credit card companies having a history of abusing their payment network dominance. However, with the advent of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, and Lightning-based services such as Strike or recently the Cash App, this equilibrium is poised at disruption.The video of Strike’s CEO Jack Mallers streaming dollars over the Lightning Network is a demonstration of a fundamentally different payment network. If Lightning Network-based payments can offer final settlement at a lower cost, the marginal merchant may offer preferential pricing to pay via Lightning, or simply restrict or deny credit cards altogether. If more people switch to a Lightning-based payment network, credit card companies may have to compensate for their declining revenues by imposing higher fees on their users, which could accelerate a popular switch to Lightning. This is the downslope of a network effect.Another notable example is the remittance industry, which enables workers to send money abroad via its networks of offices, agents, ATMs, and websites while extracting value via fees and exchange rates. As more people remit via the Bitcoin network, chasing more attractive fees, wait times, and exchange rates, the legacy remittance industry will face a crisis. Declining revenues may force raising fees, reducing customer service, or worsening exchange rates, which will serve to both depress the network attractor force and amplify the extractive repulsor force. Mitigating customer loss by improving network robustness is no small feat in the face of a worsening financial position.The fixed overhead costs of for-profit financial networks can be seen as structural extractive repulsor forces, integral to their business models. Whereas historically people may have gravitated to the largest networks with the biggest economies of scale, those same networks now carry the biggest financial burdens on the downslope of a network effect.For financial networks, the deleterious impact of a declining network may be less sudden and noticeable at the outset. A large number of customers and merchants adopting Bitcoin-based networks will not immediately diminish the value that legacy financial networks provide to their existing user-base. Credit cards will still be swiped, money will still be transferred, and account balances will still be accessible. However, over time as network attractor forces increasingly pull marginal users away from legacy networks, the fees, wait times, accessibility, and exchange rates will worsen, not improve. That worsening user experience can be self-reinforcing at an exponential pace and is the downslope of a network effect. As Bitcoin and the Lightning Network offer alternatives for value storage and exchange with little to no barriers to entry, legacy financial networks will be challenged. Any business that relies on the power of network effects, should recognize the precariousness of a Metcalfe-Hall equilibrium and that declines can be steeper than inclines.Gradually, then suddenly.This is a guest post by Matthew Pettigrew.

2022-02-05T14:00:00-05:00,"Bitcoin development in Africa, with a proper regulatory environment, could equally accelerate the continent and the technology.In this piece, we’ll be analyzing the current state of the Bitcoin developer ecosystem in Africa, ways to improve it and what the road ahead looks like.Photo by Hu Chen on Unsplash.Since 2009, Bitcoin has graduated from an obscure open-source attempt at creating electronic money, worked on by a handful of programmers, to a global effort with almost a thousand contributors from varying parts around the world, tirelessly working on maintaining and building out a network behind a ~$1 trillion asset.Despite all this growth and adoption, as it stands today, the number of developers working full time on the Bitcoin reference client — Bitcoin Core — is well below 40, and the number of maintainers is within single digits. These are the individuals around the globe working day and night on the most foundational infrastructure.One of the biggest threats to the future of Bitcoin is not having enough skilled and talented developers to maintain the code that underlies its entire ecosystem.It is, therefore, not only imperative that we expand this pool of Bitcoin developers, but we must also decentralize this developer base to further fortify future development from influence by rogue actors and sponsors.There are an even smaller number of Bitcoin developers on the African continent, with the number further shrinking as we go lower in the stack, from the Lightning Network daemon (LND) all the way down to Bitcoin Core. This shallow number of developers working on Bitcoin development is the result of multiple factors — one of which is the widely held belief among developers that Bitcoin is devoid of innovation and is a deprecated technology (or at least soon to be).Crypto projects operating in the Web 3.0 space capitalize on these perceptions and often propagate them. These projects tend to capture a lot of the developer mindshare especially through hackathons and other avenues — save outright throwing money at developers — to get them working on their platforms and chains.Further complicating matters is the idea that Bitcoin is a scam or Ponzi scheme and is used primarily for illicit activities. Some certain realities do lend credence to these beliefs in the eyes of many, such as, in the early days of Bitcoin proliferation around the world, numerous fraudulent projects and entities banked on the popularity of Bitcoin to outright defraud unsuspecting masses, with certain scams persisting to date. The mainstream media was also swift, early on, to magnify the minute instances of nefarious groups using bitcoin to fund their operations. Nowadays, stories revolve around concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption to the same effect.Most times, developers happen to harbor this warped framing of Bitcoin and are, therefore, unwilling to pay attention to it, let alone venture into Bitcoin development. They also assume the Bitcoin developer community is toxic and unwelcoming based on the brash micro-community of Bitcoiners on Twitter, which couldn't be further from the truth. However, for those who may have weathered all the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), contributing to projects such as Bitcoin Core — and Bitcoin development in general — is seen as exceedingly daunting. Additionally, in practice, these developers do not view Bitcoin development as a sustainable career path (often citing an assumed lack of funding).While it is no surprise that Bitcoin development is not an easy task, it is a stretch to consider it out of reach for developers, even for ones without prior experience working on open-source projects. What is required is a learned skill set that includes significant focus, mental context switching, knowledge about the Bitcoin protocol and software, and decent programming acumen.It’s not entirely far-fetched to consider Bitcoin development a tiresome and unsustainable career choice. After all, most Bitcoin contributors and developers do it pro bono — as is the case for most open-source projects.However, the recent increase in funding sources for developers working on Bitcoin (e.g., Human Rights Foundation, Bitmex, Spiral, etc.) has made this only partially true. Nevertheless, I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge the realities and limitations of relying solely on grants to work on Bitcoin as a viable career path; the payments are infrequent, though substantial, and may not be an in-place replacement for traditional employment. However, there are now year-long grants provided by Brink, for example, that make it a lot more sustainable to work full-time on Bitcoin.Notwithstanding, we can narrow down the possibilities for developers seeking to venture into Bitcoin development into the following:All of the above have their strengths and weaknesses. However, they are still viable paths for developers seeking to work on Bitcoin development, specifically at the protocol level.Further, it is vital to highlight that the Bitcoin development landscape includes multiple layers of software that interact and form an entire ecosystem and is not limited to working on protocol-level projects.Bitcoin development stretches far beyond maintaining Bitcoin Core or LND and includes their alternative software implementations, Bitcoin node operating systems, utility and client libraries, and an entire set of associated software such as wallets, payment processors and even exchanges.Therefore, developers can still contribute to Bitcoin development by working on software outside of protocol-level projects, and greatly provide value and earn a living, as some of the projects have companies behind them that can hire them and provide a salary to work on their projects and ventures.All these issues discussed so far can first be effectively tackled through more outreach and education.This education must come as a holistic package: both technical and pragmatic. For example, for developers, it is crucial to teach them about wallet architecture, protocol-level and other foundational concepts, and at the same time ensure individuals learn how to store bitcoin securely and other “out-of-spec” skills.In trying to educate developers, we must expose them to all possible avenues of contributing to Bitcoin development in the open-source context, or as a fellow Bitcoiner put it, partake in the “unglamorous parts” of open-source work such as labeling issues, minor reviews, documentation and trivial pull requests (PRs). There is still a chasm we must be cognizant of between opening your first PR and establishing oneself as a Bitcoin contributor to get grants and other forms of funding to work full-time. Thus, it is pertinent for us to attend to those stuck between carrying the “newbie” label and becoming experienced developers by providing the necessary fundamental knowledge and skills to grow and gradually cross over. We do so by ensuring we build and support programs, initiatives and resources targeting this demographic. An immediate issue facing developers — regardless of skill level — is a lack of structure for a path to becoming a Bitcoin developer, as there is for becoming a web developer, for example.We, therefore, need more projects and initiatives tailored toward the pivotal stages of a Bitcoin developer’s journey, starting with training junior developers without coding experience to a stage where they have the necessary technical foundation and coding skill level, ensuring they have a clear path toward progressing into more mid-level development. This can be achieved with programs that can help refine their skills (along with other engineers and senior developers) that can transition into working in the industry, building out innovative solutions, and working on base layer infrastructure.In that same light, my fellow Bitcoin developers and I have had the privilege of launching Qala — a developer program that would train the next generation of African Bitcoin developers. We intend to develop the technical talent locally and, at the same time, ensure there is adequate financial support during (through stipends) and after training (through employment and or grants or sponsorships) to make Bitcoin development a sustainable career path. Though currently targeted at more mid-level to senior developers, it ultimately intends to impart the required technical knowledge to contribute to Bitcoin and the ecosystem at large. (You can subscribe to the Qala newsletter to keep up with developments in the Bitcoin space in Africa.)Nevertheless, existing technology skills acquisition centers and bodies (e.g., technology hubs) need to be pulled along and provided with the necessary Bitcoin educational resources to help train and educate more novice developers. By leveraging existing organizations focused on technology and digital literacy, it would be possible to build out a thriving pipeline of junior developers.Hackathons, boot camps and other associated programs could be supplementally beneficial to the progression of budding developers into mid-level and senior developers.With the presence of programs such as Qala and others that may be spawned across the continent, it would provide these developers with the following opportunities at the end of the tunnel:To avoid duplicating efforts, we must, essentially, seek out talent, create and sponsor local initiatives, and collaborate to move things forward and get a thriving developer pipeline from zero to Bitcoin developer.Africa is home to more than a thousand indigenous languages, with non-English speaking countries. The majority of Bitcoin material available is in the English language, which means we must also engage in translation efforts to unlock knowledge for millions of non-English speakers on the continent, both on the developer and user front.Currently, there are efforts around Africa to translate Bitcoin material into different languages such as Amharic, Arabic and Wolof by Kal Kassa, Arabic_HODL and Fodé Diop, respectively, with ongoing work on others. These efforts are valiant and must not only be supported but empowered and expanded. Porting Bitcoin educational material grows the set of developers and individuals that can not only use Bitcoin as a tool for economic empowerment but contribute their talent and skill to build solutions tailored to solve issues facing their locale.While the source code of projects may be in English, translating out-of-code material into other languages can bootstrap understanding and get individuals up to speed and involved in the global Bitcoin conversation.As a side note, developers and non-developers can also contribute to language translations and grammar or spelling fixes (e.g., in projects like LND). We can bring awareness to these possibilities by educating individuals and disillusioning them about the requirements for contributing and becoming equipped with the necessary technical knowledge about Bitcoin. In so doing, we must ensure projects are not spammed with frivolous changes to avoid disrupting development. We must draw clear distinctions about what constitutes the contributions we are discussing to ensure willing contributors are adding value.It is important to reiterate that both technical and nontechnical education must be viewed as two sides of the same coin, as they intricately go hand in hand. Though usage from the end users influence the design and flow of software, understanding and communicating best practices from developers is a good way of ensuring users do not harm themselves and face economic consequences, especially in the case of Bitcoin — for example, loss of funds due to the imprecise use of Bitcoin software.Contributing to the Bitcoin development ecosystem does not stop at translations or contributing code, as there are other ways, in the context of education, that one can help. For example, content writers exploring Bitcoin can significantly contribute to education efforts by breaking down concepts, highlighting developments and other similar detailings.Artists and designers could also use their artistic voices to educate and bring about awareness of Bitcoin or help improve user interfaces, accordingly.Additionally, individuals who already understand Bitcoin can contribute to the ecosystem by educating their immediate circle: family, friends and neighbors. The education could range from explaining to the best of your abilities what Bitcoin is all the way to teaching them about how to keep their mnemonic safe.(Source)Unfortunately, in the open-source space, projects at the very core of a technology stack tend to be underfunded compared to projects that depend on them. In the case of Bitcoin, developers working higher up the development stack (i.e., wallets, exchanges, etc.) tend to experience higher levels of — and more frequent — funding relative to developers working on more base layer projects such as Bitcoin Core.In growing a thriving Bitcoin development ecosystem, it is essential to provide funding at various levels of development. Developers in the space mostly work on open-source software that has no direct source of funding, as is the case for working as a hired developer in a company on closed-source software. To enable working on open-source software — which is at the core of the Bitcoin ecosystem — it is essential to provide avenues for funding, whether through grants, sponsorships or donations.Currently, there are organizations such as the Human Rights Foundation, Bitmex and Brink, which offer a variety of funding structures varying from year-long sponsorships to one-time grants. The growing number of these organizations and sources of funding from the inception of Bitcoin development is a testament to its continued growth and importance in the global landscape.Moving forward, as Bitcoin continues to gain more adoption, it will become increasingly necessary to grow the basket of available sponsors for developers working in the ecosystem.Decentralization is at the core of Bitcoin, and this quality extends into funding. Down the line, it is vital to ensure sources of funding for Bitcoin development become distributed across varying territories. One reason behind this is to avoid any single — or set of — sponsors from using their monopoly to influence or control Bitcoin development and the future of Bitcoin.It is integral to decentralize the funding pool to avoid scenarios where development relies on a single large backer — or set of backers — who could pull out or go bust and leave developers without financial support.It is just as integral to the future of Bitcoin development to ensure that there are independent developers that aren’t beholden to any entity, which could make them compromised — in the sense that they become vassals carrying out the bidding of their sponsors.Financial support isn’t limited to well-funded companies, as individuals can also financially contribute to projects — they usually provide ways of donating, e.g., Bitcoin addresses — and to individual Bitcoin developers. You never know what impact your contribution could have on the project or developer. It takes a lot more than companies to make any meaningful change.Beyond providing direct sponsorship, grants and donations from organizations, Bitcoin companies and exchanges can employ Bitcoin developers and pay them to work on Bitcoin open-source projects such as Bitcoin Core (similar to how companies hire Linux engineers to work on the kernel).Alternatively, as pointed out by a fellow Bitcoiner, these employers could consider giving their hires some time out of their week to work on Bitcoin, which can translate to a way of giving back to the Bitcoin community without explicitly giving out grants or funding. It also comes with the added advantage of helping them internally as most Bitcoin companies use and rely on open-source libraries and projects in the ecosystem.Currently, we are experiencing two separate but highly related asymmetries on the continent: (1) between the number of talented developers and those of them that work on Bitcoin development, and similarly, (2) between the number of reliable Bitcoin on- and off-ramps and the number of enthusiastic Bitcoin consumers, where there is a divide between available products or solutions and the growing Bitcoin consumer base.To address and correct these asymmetries, we must engage in Bitcoin technical capacity building: educating and training developers to grow the pool of Bitcoin developers. These developers are crucial in building the much-needed tools, services and software to address local economic challenges, simplify access to Bitcoin and tap into a global monetary network.Building tools, apps and services atop Bitcoin allows individuals to access a global payment network that is censorship-resistant, open and cheap. By leveraging the Lightning Network, we can provide cheap instant settlements across the globe. Those without formal accounts can use bitcoin to engage in both local and global commercial activities in a way that is instant, free from government oppression and orders of magnitude cheaper. It is, therefore, a powerful substitute for the unbanked. In short, Bitcoin localizes the global economy under a single payment interface.“We all have one API and it’s Bitcoin.” — Carla Kirk-Cohen (Infrastructure Engineer, Lightning Labs)With Bitcoin, it is possible to build infrastructure which provides an alternative to existing inefficient and unsophisticated payment infrastructure. By providing a more reliable, resilient, instant and cheaper payment network, you expose individuals to a novel set of possibilities regarding how they communicate economically in their locale and with others in different parts of the globe.Providing real economic empowerment to these communities can only come about by working with those on the ground in harnessing the potential and building out critical infrastructure and solutions.As part of our efforts toward growing the Bitcoin development ecosystem, we must also focus on building Bitcoin infrastructure to aid in further securing the network and expanding on its resilience. In this light, we must ensure the network continues to be decentralized and open to everyone.The case for distributed access to the Bitcoin network is a significant component in this regard, especially in developing regions lacking reliable internet connectivity. As an example, Blockstream’s satellite kit and receivers are a good example, as they provide a direct communication line — without requiring reliance on existing internet providers — to access the Bitcoin network. Individuals in communities can be guaranteed always-on-demand access to the Bitcoin network without fear of being left out due to substandard internet access in their region.Other off-grid solutions such as mesh networks will increasingly be vital in building out reliable Bitcoin infrastructure that is needed to serve individuals from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.Ensuring that the Bitcoin network remains decentralized is also greatly important to keep it open and censorship resistant. Having individuals rely on a small set of nodes increases the chances of eclipsing them (where they can be isolated from the rest of the network by a malicious adversary). Though there is a risk of having nodes connect to peers in their geographic location, as that could fragment the network, it is still crucial to provide a variety of nodes from different parts of the globe to connect to and avoid being subject to potential network-based attacks.Bitcoin mining is another facet of the entire Bitcoin infrastructure stack that needs to be distributed around the globe and avoid pockets of concentration to maintain censorship resistance. It is paramount that mining remains open, competitive and distributed across multiple geographies.A concentration of mining pools in a specific region could give rise to potential censorship of transactions of a specific origin, kind or ones spending from, or to, addresses of interest. To illustrate this, take the following example:A mining pool could choose to discriminate — whether for ideological or even regulatory reasons — between which transactions get in the chain (outside normal operating parameters such as analyzing transaction size and fee rate), which would result in a significant compromise to an essential part of Bitcoin — censorship resistance.Another more commonly referenced risk is a 51% attack, where a miner or set of miners amass 51% of the Bitcoin network’s hash rate and could perform attacks such as double-spending of coins.It, therefore, becomes a lot clearer why requiring more distributed mining pools across the world is concomitant with protecting the network and its users from economic censorship.Beyond the distribution of mining pools across the globe, the inhabitants of the African continent stand to benefit from participating in Bitcoin mining.There are numerous incentives for investors and energy plants alike to venture into the mining space. According to the World Bank, Nigeria is ranked as the seventh largest gas flaring country worldwide, and in 2020 emitted more than 7 billion cubic meters of gas. It is possible to harness this flared gas that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere to power ASICs for Bitcoin mining. Not only will this roll back the carbon footprint, but it’ll provide energy-generation companies with an alternative revenue stream that can be channeled into developing local infrastructure.The benefits extend far beyond helping curb energy curtailment and extant pollution in Nigeria, as it also helps further decentralize the global distribution of miners.Through Bitcoin mining, we can bootstrap electricity generation for communities and infrastructural development to both rural and urban areas accordingly.It is, unfortunately, the case that certain parts of Africa have underdeveloped energy infrastructure, extending from generation to distribution. There are several instances across the continent where there is a disconnect between the energy-generation capacity and existing transmission capacity. It is, therefore, the case that numerous locations are in a state of infrequent electricity delivery or none at all, as the distribution infrastructure is just unable to transport energy to communities in need of this electricity.It is possible with Bitcoin mining to build off-grid solutions in these areas without requiring immediate distribution infrastructure or high local demand for electricity. The idea is to set up ASICs as the primary consumer of this electricity, and revenue from the mining process can be used to invest in building out transmission and distribution infrastructure.The ASICs are initially the majority consumer of electricity, and with time, as the surrounding infrastructure develops, the mining operation can be gradually scaled down as demand for electricity in the community increases.With such a setup, it is economically feasible to provide electricity to underserved communities and even build out energy infrastructure in these areas.Beyond the few use cases identified thus far, and with the maturation of Bitcoin development on the African continent, a whole host of possibilities still awaits with even further far-reaching benefits.We must, therefore, take the first steps toward maturing the Bitcoin development ecosystem.Photo by Drew Beamer on Unsplash.To attain the level of adoption that would unlock transformational economic opportunities at an individual and societal level, we must engage with lawmakers and governments to ensure mutual benefit and Bitcoin-friendly regulations. Failing to do so would mean large swaths of individuals, who might not possess the technical expertise to circumvent restrictive regulations, would be left with no tangible avenue to access Bitcoin. It is, therefore, vital that we educate and bring onboard lawmakers to ensure they, too, understand the attendant benefits of allowing the proliferation and integration of the Bitcoin network into our global legacy financial system.As more countries on the continent begin to understand the potential benefits at a state level, we may even see countries, within this decade or the next — most likely smaller ones — adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, just as El Salvador has done.Nevertheless, the gaps and opportunities previously cited can only be addressed and tapped into, accordingly, by increasing the pool of Bitcoin developers and other ecosystem stakeholders to build out, manage and maintain all the infrastructure.We are at the precipice of global monetary evolution, and as Africans, we cannot afford to be outside this global transformation. We must strategically position the continent to be at the forefront of the global Bitcoin development to provide a net positive impact by harnessing the existing talent and capitalizing on all the attendant benefits of Bitcoin.We, therefore, have no option but to unite the existing — but fragmented — developer ecosystems across the continent to bring about the development we need to build the future.The road ahead looks bright, and I am cautiously optimistic that the African continent will play a pivotal role in not only furthering the development of Bitcoin but in utilizing it to launch Africa into the forefront of this monetary revolution.

2022-02-05T12:30:00-05:00,"While a plan to leverage “volcano energy” is great marketing for El Salvador’s planned Bitcoin City, on its own, it might not be the best source.SourceThe creation of a Bitcoin City powered by “volcano energy” proposed by El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele is appealing for many bitcoiners at an emotional, aesthetic level.Envisioned in the shape of a perfect circle, like a coin, with a bitcoin-symbol-shaped public square in the middle and a multitude of urban nodes radiating in every direction, the proposed city’s aesthetics aim to resonate symbolically with bitcoiners.This vision makes sense based on Bukele’s communication and marketing savviness. It could also be a great opportunity for Fr-ee, the architecture and industrial design firm founded by Fernando Romero, as Bitcoin City is a rehash of Romero’s FR-EE City, a 2012 “urban prototype for building new cities in the emerging economies of the 21st century,” as the website describes it.The emotional, aesthetic foundations of Bitcoin City can be viewed as quite sound among Bitcoiners. But its energy foundations may not be the best possible fit for the Bitcoin edifice Bukele wants to spur — at least in terms of their cost and speed.The “volcano energy” that Bitcoin City is supposed to tap into is more commonly known as “geothermal energy.” Calling it “volcano energy” sounds, of course, more exciting and it demonstrates once again Bukele’s marketing and branding acumen.The reason why geothermal energy might not be the best and quickest fit for Bitcoin City has to do with its development time and costs. It can take five to seven years to go through all the phases involved, according to some geothermal project timelines.In the case of the Colchagua volcano, which is the one near which Bitcoin City would be built, the first phases are underway or have been already carried out, as last June, Bukele tweeted that engineers had already dug a well with 95 megawatts (MW) of geothermal capacity at the site.Even so, it will likely take at least another two to three years before the plant can start generating electricity, to be used for a bitcoin mining hub around it.This hints at one big reason why geothermal energy has not been significantly developed in the last few decades, either in El Salvador or in the world in general, even though it avoids the drawbacks of intermittency that solar and wind power suffer. Although it’s cheap to operate and provides almost unlimited hours of operation, geothermal energy has very long lead times and, until all of the technical “i’s” have been dotted and the economic “t’s” have been crossed, results are uncertain. Projects can remain, quite literally, holes in the ground.Solar and wind power plants can also take time to be developed, but that’s usually due to permitting procedures, not technical difficulties or uncertainties about solar irradiation and wind speeds, and their lead time is generally shorter, about one to two years for utility-scale systems, and less for smaller ones, according to industry interviews.Issues of time and costs cannot be underestimated in the decisions of public and private investors. Let’s try and paint a simple yet comprehensive picture with broad data that are representative of different renewable energy technologies across the world.In 2020, the average total installed cost of eight new geothermal plants monitored by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) was $4,486 per kilowatt (kW), ranging from a low of $2,140 per kW to a high of $6,248 per kW. Focusing on El Salvador, a recent study presented at the last World Geothermal Congress by Salvadoran, Icelandic and Iranian researchers quotes a total cost of $480 million for a 50 MW geothermal plant in the Central American country (table two), or $9,600 per kW.For comparison, the average total installed cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) projects commissioned in 2020 and monitored in the IRENA database was $883 per kW — about one-fifth the cost per kW of IRENA-monitored geothermal power, or about one-tenth the cost of geothermal power per the World Geothermal Congress study. If we compare it with offshore wind power, its average total installed cost came at $1,355 per kW in 2020 — about one-and-a-half-times cheaper than volcano energy.Beside development and installation expenses, another important factor is the cost of generating energy once a plant has started production. To do that, let’s look at the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), which measures the average net-present cost of electricity generation for a power plant over its lifetime. It’s a key number used to plan investments and compare different methods of power generation in a consistent way.The average LCOE of the geothermal projects commissioned in 2020 was $0.071 per kilowatt hour (kWh), broadly in line with values seen over the previous four years. That compares with an LCOE for solar and onshore wind that has been falling rapidly in the last 10 years and that in 2020 was $0.057 per kWh and $0.039 per kWh, respectively.That means geothermal energy is about 25% more expensive to produce than solar, and about 82% more expensive than onshore wind.As far as costs and lead times, solar and wind power are the clear winners over geothermal energy, as this IRENA graph shows.10-year global LCOEs for new, utility-scale renewable power generation technologies, Illustration by IRENA. Source.As mentioned, geothermal power is not intermittent and plants can produce for more hours than solar or wind systems. The measure of how much electricity any given plant produces compared to its theoretical maximum possible output is called the “capacity factor.” It’s an important measure because it indicates how fully a power plant can be used.Let’s compare the capacity factors of different energy sources, again using IRENA’s data.In 2020, the global average capacity factor for new geothermal plants was 83%, ranging from a low of 75% to a high of 91%, while the average capacity factor for new, utility-scale solar PV plants was 16.1% and that for onshore wind farms was 36%, per IRENA.That means the capacity factor, i.e., the effectively available hours of operation, for geothermal plants was five times higher than for solar and 2.3 times bigger than for onshore wind.The amount of usable energy that any power generation technology produces compared to its energy input is called “energy conversion efficiency.”The highest reported conversion efficiency is approximately 21% at an Indonesian geothermal plant, with a global efficiency average of around 12%, according to a 2014 worldwide review of 94 geothermal plants published in the “Geothermics” journal.The energy conversion efficiency of new, commercially-available photovoltaic panels is now between 21% and 23%, with researchers that have already developed solar cells with efficiencies approaching 50%. Wind turbines extract on average about 40% of the energy from the wind that passes through them.Basically, geothermal power is five-times more expensive to develop and install than solar, and around two- to three-times more time consuming, but it can produce five times the energy of solar and more than twice that of wind power per MW, as it can work day and night, winter and summer, doldrums and gale — unlike solar and wind (unless one uses battery systems, the development of which is fast progressing, but that presently can only cover a few hours of consumption every day, as is well known in the industry).But geothermal energy is also a quarter more expensive to produce than solar, almost twice as expensive as onshore wind and its energy conversion efficiency is around 10 percentage points lower than solar PV, and about three- to four-times lower than wind power.One can capture the combination of these different factors by looking at the dual efficiency score for renewable energies. The higher the score, the better a technology performs on a wide series of criteria.This score summarizes economic dimensions as inputs on one side, and energy, environmental and social dimension as outputs on the other, based on data from IRENA, the World Bank and the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, as illustrated in a recent study focusing on Organisation For Economic Cooperation And Development (OECD) countries and published in the “Sustainability” journal.The authors warn that “reliable data for geothermal energy were available for only three countries, Chile, Mexico, and Turkey [in] 2014, with an efficiency score of 77.9%, 72.8%, and 86.4%, respectively.” These data compare with an average of 92.98% for wind and solar energy in 2016, per the study.It should be reiterated that in the five to seven years since these data were collected, costs for solar and wind have fallen considerably, while their energy efficiencies have increased, as opposed to geothermal energy, whose costs have increased and whose energy efficiency has remained stable.Even so, the geothermal energy in the Central American country considered in the study (Mexico) and sharing some of the same tectonic plates and geological formations as El Salvador, has a dual efficiency of less than 73% — more than 20 percentage points below solar or wind’s dual efficiency.Geological map of El Salvador (detail) with the Colchagua volcano area in the green circle . Illustration by the United States Geological Survey. Source.Geological map of Mexico (detail). Illustration by United States Geological Survey. Source.Even if El Salvador has a rainy season from May to October, the area of the Colchagua volcano, in the southeast of El Salvador, is blessed with very high sun irradiation, as the below illustration of El Salvador’s photovoltaic power potential shows.Colchagua Volcano area in the green circle . Illustration by World Bank Group. Source.As an example, one only needs to look at the Capella Solar PV-plus storage facility which officially opened in December 2020, providing electricity and power reserve to El Salvador’s grid.The Capella Solar operation is located in the Usulután department in El Salvador’s southeast — in the same area as the Bitcoin City would be, about 100 kilometers to the west of the Colchagua volcano.The solar plant is now the country’s largest. It has a 20-year power purchase agreement with local power distributors at an average price of $0.049 per kWh ($49.55 per megawatt hour [MWh]), which is now the cheapest energy in the Salvadoran market. Attached to it, there is a 3.2 MW and 2.2 MWh lithium-ion battery storage system, which provides frequency regulation support to the grid and is the largest system of its type to date in Central America.President Bukele intends to finance construction of Bitcoin City by issuing a series of so-called “volcano bonds.” worth $1 billion each, carrying a coupon of 6.5%. The name refers to the idea that these 10-year bonds will be backed by bitcoin, both mined with “volcano energy” and bought on the market. Half of the sum would go to buying bitcoin on the market and the other half would pay for the city’s infrastructure, such as the development of bitcoin mining facilities, Bukele has said. The first 10-year bond should be issued this year and others will follow. As construction is to be funded by volcano bonds, which are to be backed by bitcoin, which are at least in part to be mined with geothermal energy, timing and costs of the energy infrastructure is a key factor both for the long-term sustainability of the city and the upfront financial viability of the project itself.The biggest bang for El Salvador’s buck would come from mining its own bitcoin with its own renewable energy as soon as possible, as opposed to buying bitcoin on the market. As any miner would attest, access to the cheapest possible energy is the single most important factor in determining the viability of a mining project.If time and cost are of the essence for bitcoin mining and Bitcoin City, then maybe geothermal energy is not the best possible option.Developing a geothermal project presents a unique set of challenges when it comes to assessing the resource and how the underground reservoir will react once production starts. Underground resource assessments are expensive and need to be confirmed by test wells. Bukele has said that engineers have already done at least part of this job.“Much, however, will remain unknown about how the reservoir will perform and how best to manage it over the operational life of the project,” IRENA has stated. “In addition to increasing development costs, these issues mean geothermal projects have very different risk profiles compared to other renewable power generation technologies, in terms of both project development and operation.”Research focusing on the relationships between energy flows and urban development has shown that “intensive and diversified energy sources build up the structure and enhance metabolism in urban areas,” according to a study published in “Ecological Modelling.”As geothermal energy is home grown in El Salvador, as well as less polluting, more available than many other sources and directly usable both for thermal and electric energy generation, it’s certainly worth pursuing, but not necessarily as a first choice. It would probably work better as a component of a wider renewable energy mix.One should be able to install a utility-sized solar PV field in about a year and start mining bitcoin much sooner than in the two to three years minimum that a geothermal project would take. That headstart could make a big difference in making the financial foundations of volcano bonds sounder and Bitcoin City more likely to succeed.This is a guest post by Lorenzo Vallecchi.

2022-02-04T19:00:00-05:00,"Purchasing fractions of a bitcoin can be a mental hurdle for some — but a satoshi standard could help alleviate that.The current price of bitcoin makes it seem as if the world's leading cryptocurrency is no longer approachable by mainstream users. A five-digit price point makes people rethink their decision, as most assume they still need to buy one full bitcoin. Introducing denomination in satoshis can, in my opinion, make a lot more sense when onboarding newcomers. It may take some effort before the satoshi standard becomes commonplace, though. Most people in our society can only think in full coins. One dollar, one euro, one pound sterling. Although we can all use change, no one is a fan of the system. If something is priced at $4.22, we will pull out a $5 bill and dump the change we receive into a pocket somewhere. Society likes round numbers, which creates an annoying problem when dealing with bitcoin. Convenience often trumps everything else but acquiring bitcoin with that mindset isn't necessarily convenient.More specifically, a lot of people remain convinced that they need to buy an entire bitcoin. While that is an option, the current price point makes it very difficult to do so for the majority. When people encounter the idea of spending over $45,000 to buy something that isn't yet tangible to them, it can be a tricky ordeal. Although the higher price benefits the crypto industry, many support a potential denomination change.While the option to trade full bitcoin will always remain available, some people would prefer to see a satoshi standard. Even Mike Novogratz, a respected and renowned crypto investor and trader, would like to see such a standard implemented. So, I can personally get behind the idea of trading satoshis versus bitcoin — however, only if we can achieve this without confusing people even further. From a price perspective, one satoshi is more accessible than one bitcoin. There needs to be clear information for users to know what they are buying — but if we describe the divisibility of bitcoin to people, it should be simple.Although I like the proposal, we have to ask ourselves if it makes sense to denominate things in satoshis. Several exchanges appear in favor of this idea — for example, the AAX platform introduced a BTC-SAT conversion option. Additionally, the exchange introduced a SAT-USDT pair to determine if satoshis would be more accessible and appealing to new traders. Moreover, one has to consider the costs of buying and trading satoshis over bitcoin. The network will require a fee, which, on a satoshi standard, could appear rather large. One solution is to tap into the Lightning Network to offer faster and cheaper transactions. As much as a satoshi standard would make sense, the logistical challenges may prove a bit complex. The trading of bitcoin has become the industry standard; it is unclear if companies would see the satoshi standard the same. It is no secret that bitcoin's price appears too high for consumers who do not understand they do not need to purchase a full bitcoin. Although anyone can buy as much or as little as they want, buying a fraction of a bitcoin appears to create a mental hurdle. I think the introduction of a satoshi standard can change this narrative for the better, under particular restrictions. Setting maximum order limits before switching back to the bitcoin market by default is one option for exchanges to consider. As several platforms already provide this functionality, an essential first step has been taken. Trading in sats makes the market more accessible and approachable. There are still many logistical issues to figure out, including trading pairs, price fluctuations and technological hurdles. Solving and addressing these unknown factors and questions needs to happen if a satoshi standard is to be introduced. This is a guest post by Alex Zha.

2022-02-04T18:00:00-05:00,"The Ottawa freedom movement requires funding and support, and Bitcoin is best poised to facilitate this.The honking will continue until morale improves. A consortium of supply chain, working-class heroes have taken to the streets of Canada to fill the air with incessant blasts from their big rigs to put pressure on the governing class and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Right on cue, within a couple of days Trudeau isolated himself from the media and the cacophonous convoy in an exposure-based protocol. This procedure, according to his own official government health officials, was unnecessary given his triple-vaccinated status. On the last day of January, less than a week after the tip of the convoy breached the Canadian capital, Trudeau announced that he tested positive, removed himself from Ottawa, and is now working in a remote area outside of the grounds affected by the protesters and their honking. Later that afternoon, the healthy-appearing leader of our northernmost brethren released a video of himself speaking outside a residential home, making note that these protesters do not represent Canada. He even went so far as to make reference to the many at home “watching in disgust and disbelief at this behavior, wondering how this could have happened?” Earlier on in this public health messaging catastrophe, he now infamously stated that those against the vaccine passports and border mandates were “a small, fringe minority” who hold “unacceptable views.” Despite the obvious worry that should ripple through us all when we hear a leader of a democratic, free speech protected country calling views on citizens’ bodily autonomy and their right to assemble unacceptable, perhaps even more troublesome is the flat out misinformation and propagandized misrepresentation of the scope of this protest. According to “Guinness World Records” the longest truck convoy on record was merely 7.5 kilometers long, clocking in at 480 trucks, in Egypt in 2020. The self-described Freedom Convoy is nearly a magnitude longer at 70 kilometers long, stretching from British Columbia to Ottawa, according to Benjamin Dichter, a spokesman for the convoy. There are an estimated 35,000 - 50,000 trucks taking part in this working-class protest of the new COVID-19 vaccine mandates being put in place at the border between the United States and Canada. These new laws are preventing truckers — the backbone of our supply chains, and the lifeblood of the national and international trade that we all quite literally rely on for goods, medicines, food and other pieces of a healthy, open economy — from crossing the border freely and thus functioning properly. The mandates, while often argued in favor of their medical benefits, are in contrast to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, and the otherwise open borders between North American countries; many seemingly believe these are only being utilized as an infrastructural attack on free trade and the working class. We are not a science journal, nor is the editor, publisher or author qualified to speak on the medical pros and cons, but we are able to see the contradiction and hypocrisy presented in these asinine laws that have unfair and unprecedented effects on both the working class involved in the trucker profession, as well as the many citizens down the line who will begin to feel the pressures of a harder-squeezed supply chain. One of the largest stories of this workers’ revolution against the bio-medical surveillance state is an eight-figure GoFundMe campaign that was started in order to feed and pay the truckers for missed pay whilst they occupy the nation's capital and pepper the night sky with horns from their 18-wheelers. This GoFundMe account surpassed $10 million [CAD] before the centralizing figures behind the website decided to pause the fund and prevent further money raised by fellow working-class believers in the movement from making its way into the hands and stomachs of the convoy. Perhaps an adage that has lost its luster with overuse, but quite truly, “Bitcoin fixes this.” The payment rails and processing services that are at the core of the GoFundMe.com concept are ripe for the picking when the political movements behind certain causes are not aligned with the centralized governing bodies of the platform. The peer-to-peer, uncensorable nature of a Bitcoin transaction could be, should be and is being put to use by the thousands of convoy cohorts and their financial supporters across the continent. Not only could the Bitcoin network be used to create a catch-all address for funds to be sent from across the world, but that very address could easily and cheaply dispense funds across the tens of thousands of truckers making a stand against this border restriction in order to prolong their efforts until their demands are heard and hopefully met by the leaders of Canada. This is truly a workers’ revolution, despite the slander from the supposed anti-fascist, pro-worker progressive party that runs the country, and every workers’ revolution has been significantly influenced by the financial underpinnings of the time; this time is certainly no different. The strain on the supply chain and its inflationary effects, of course alongside massive monetary expansion of both Canadian and United States dollar supply, will only be further exacerbated by this protest, and thus the ability for the convoy to stay fed and financially supported will perhaps be the crux of its success. We talked to an organizer who goes by NobodyCaribou on February 2 to gather further insight to the movement: ""I was talking to one of the truckers today and he told me 'I'm either leaving here in a police cruiser, a hearse, or I get my freedom' and that's the kind of long haul energy we have.” The physical realities of the pieces of the protest are perhaps not understood by the masses; the powerful, logistical infrastructure of masters of the supply chain allow fluidity of diesel refuels, food distribution and financial delegation all without an official coordination. These are people willing and quite able to withstand the war of attrition, many having outfitted their big rigs for sleeping and living quarters, and the stamina of passion to postulate about “how nice it'll be when there's longer days in the summer.” The sole demand of the protestors is a simple one; restoration of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, specifically the clause that expresses “the freedom to exit, enter or move about the country with no obstruction.” NobodyCaribou wanted to stress and focus the blame on the hidden prime minister, and this obstruction of free movement in violation of the bodily autonomy of the citizens and workers of Canada. Two figureheads of the movement, a vaccinated Jewish man named Benjamin Dichter and Tamara Lich, an indigenous woman of the Métis, have stopped allowing mainstream media into the meetings and pressers due to the excessive manipulation and miscategorization of the protest and its constituents. The vast majority of the truckers are in fact vaccinated, and due to misrepresentation of being a violent, racist and unruly mob, have begun to use their phones to “be the media” and self-police the convoy. NobodyCaribou described the ethos of these operations as “if you see something that doesn't align with truth, peace, and love; call it out!” and further warned “do not engage with those you think are bad actors.” The distrust of the few pieces of coverage that have made it to newstands across the world has driven the truckers to self-regulate and thus far has created a joyous energy of celebration for freedom. In the downtime between blast of horns and the daily rounds, truckers have found themselves with plenty of time to arm themselves with the tools of financial freedom, with many prominent Canadian Bitcoiners, such as Jeff Booth and Greg Foss, offering satoshis and access to educational materials. This is truly a collaboration of Canadians, French Canadians, Indigenous people, Americans, and many more demographics of freedom-minded folks alike, coming together in unity, love and peace to simply demand the upholding of their natural and legal rights. NobodyCaribou reminds us “you can't stop truth, peace and love."" Much like the children and families seen picking up garbage, handing out coffee, much like the few Bitcoin educators pooling together funds and materials, much like the truckers themselves making themselves heard with their horns and seen with their shining 18-wheelers, everyone of us can do our part in standing alongside the working class in their fight for their human rights.

We believe it’s a matter of ‘when,’ not ‘if,’ that the Bitcoin Standard will become the Gold Standard,” Fenster added.Fenster said he started to rethink his company’s treasury strategy “in light of the excessive debasement of the U.S. dollar coupled with a 39-year high inflation rate.” The chief executive then began to learn more about the structure of a Bitcoin standard, after which the decision to adopt it became natural.“The value of the cash within our company is eroding at an unsustainable rate,” Fenster added. “I strongly encourage all business leaders to at a minimum do their own research on Bitcoin to better understand the strategy.”Everbowl will also offer its employees the option to be paid in bitcoin, a move the company will formally announce soon.“While we understand it is not possible to convert 100% of our business operations to the Bitcoin Standard at this time, we will increase our adoption and conversion as more access points become available,” Fenster said.In 2020, Canadian restaurant Tahinis embarked on a Bitcoin standard and converted all of its cash reserves into bitcoin. A couple of years later, the group started expanding across Ontario with the boost sound money gave its business."

Buyers bid online, and the art is delivered as soon as a winner is selected.“The company debuted its first auction for Chiefmonkey’s ‘Relentless Optimism’ in December 2020 and has since run nearly 300 auctions and facilitated over one thousand Rare Pepe marketplace transactions,” per the release. “The platform uses low-fee, instant bitcoin transactions made possible by the Lightning Network to under-collateralize auction bids and marketplace listings to keep participants accountable.”According to the release, the “Meme Sherman Out” collection in support of Rhodes’ campaign is Scarce City’s first major push to expand their fixed-price marketplace into physical merchandise.Image via Scarce City"
2022-02-04T13:44:43-05:00,"The Latin American real estate platform secured a deal in bitcoin for an apartment in Natura City, in the north of Colombia.Latin American real estate market leader La Haus has closed another home sale for bitcoin, the first in Colombia after recently selling a property in Mexico, Valora Analitik first reported.La Haus’ VP of innovation and future, Jehudi Castro, told Bitcoin Magazine that the transaction represented a downpayment for an apartment at Natura City, an exclusive apartment complex owned by Titles and Real Estate Developments, which is being built in the Bellavista sector, Santa Marta, in the north of Colombia.Castro added that the apartment cost approximately $98,000 in total, which at the time of writing translates to about 2.45 BTC. The buyer paid 0.03 bitcoin in the downpayment and will make incremental payments in bitcoin until the apartment’s construction is completed, which is expected to happen in 2025.“We are working to bring this type of alternative to the rest of the country, so that the payment methods and the form of investment are not a barrier to access residential goods,” Castro said, per the report.Bitcoin’s power shone by frictionlessly completing the transaction across borders, as the buyer was traveling internationally at the time of purchase. Payment processing company OpenNode facilitated the transaction to be made instantly through the Lightning Network.La Haus, which has strived to bring U.S. tech-enabled real estate services to the Latin American real estate market, started accepting payments in bitcoin for its real estate properties in November after starting a collaboration with OpenNode. The payment processor allows La Haus to receive bitcoin payments with ease both on-chain and on the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer-2 scaling solution.The company sold its first home for bitcoin last month when a Peruvian woman exchanged 5.78 BTC for an exclusive apartment located in one of the most highly valued areas of the city of Tulum, Mexico's Riviera Maya."
2022-02-04T11:59:18-05:00,"The public miner’s production last month was down about 4% from the month prior as Marathon’s operations fluctuated.Public bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings scooped over 462.1 new bitcoin in January, down from 484.5 BTC mined in the previous month as it faced a double-digit increase in Bitcoin’s hashrate and operational fluctuations in its Hardin, Montana, facility, the company said in a Friday statement. The miner now holds approximately 8,595 BTC with a fair market value of approximately $330.6 million.Year-over-year, however, Marathon’s production increased by about 816%, a result of the miner’s relentless search for increased hashrate capacity and power hosting agreements. The company said it had received over 93,000 bitcoin mining rigs from Bitmain, 32,710 of which are up and running in its mining farms as it works to containerize thousands of machines to deploy at Compute North’s facilities.Marathon signed an agreement with the infrastructure company in May to host and manage 73,000 of the miner’s machines, but a December expansion of the deal foresaw an extra 30,000 rigs to be accommodated.“We have begun installing miners in containers at Compute North’s new facilities, where construction is progressing well,” Marathon’s CEO, Fred Thiel, said in a statement. “These containers are currently awaiting energization. Based on current schedules, we believe that miner deployments will accelerate during the first quarter and that that trend will continue into the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year.”While construction of Compute North’s facilities remain underway, Marathon said it expects to fully deploy all its miners by early next year, bumping the company’s mining fleet to consist of nearly 200,000 machines outputting 23.3 exahashes per second (EH/s).The huge growth in the miner’s hashrate capacity from the current 3.6 EH/s would be made possible by the arrival of the tens of thousands machines Marathon recently ordered. The company bought 78,000 mining machines from Bitmain at the end of last year, a record purchase that cost over $879 million."
2022-02-04T09:00:00-05:00,"A representative of Hut 8 mining discusses the “extremely disruptive” introduction of a new ASIC chip from Intel.“Tom's Hardware broke the news yesterday that Intel would present a new ‘Bonanza Mine’ ASIC chip designed for ultra-low-voltage and energy-efficient Bitcoin mining at the upcoming ISSCC conference, but Intel would neither confirm nor deny if it would make the chip available to customers. Today, Fox Business reports that crypto-mining startup GRIID, which is set to go public for an estimated $3.3 billion on the NYSE in the coming days, has signed a long-term contract with Intel for its ‘BMZ2’ mining ASICs. This means Intel will in fact compete with its own specialized ASICs for Bitcoin mining, opening up a new market that the company hasn't addressed directly in the past.”-Tom’s HardwareASICs utilized in bitcoin mining have been largely produced by two well-known companies: MicroBT and Bitmain. The specialization and expertise required to build, maintain and repair these machines has created a rather niche market, sometimes resulting in steep price increases for the hardware needed to mine bitcoin and secure the network. With Intel entering the Bitcoin mining space and introducing what it claims will be a revolutionary ASIC chip, this critical marketplace could be permanently transformed. Some in the space are optimistic about a U.S.-based technology company entering the fray, while others are dubious.To get a better handle of how Intel might shake up the world of bitcoin mining, we spoke with Sue Ennis, the vice president of investor relations with Hut 8 Mining, a Toronto-based, publicly-listed mining firm.On February 23, at the ISSCC conference, Intel will present its new ASIC mining chip. What was the initial response from Hut 8 upon hearing the news?We were not surprised at all, and were anticipating this. Our CEO, Jaime Leverton, has been in the data infrastructure space for over 20 years, and has very strong relationships on the ground with companies like Intel, Nvidia, Dell, etc. (this is how we were able to get our hands on a limited fleet of GPU miners off Nvidia that only three customers worldwide were able to obtain, last spring. We are thrilled to see what these ASICS look like. We also take a balance-sheet-first approach to everything we do so we can be opportunistic when things like this happen.Furthermore, we take a laddered approach to how we manage our fleet, this means not being stuck with an entire fleet that is outdated technology at the start of a new technology cycle, which is what we are anticipating. We'll see how it goes this coming year with major players like Intel coming to the forefront.So, we’re thrilled about Intel coming to market!GRIID entered into an Intel supply agreement for ‘at least 25% of qualified Intel-designed ASICs’ through May 2025. This deal is for the second generation of ASICs, to be discussed at a later date. Will we see Hut 8 pursue an Intel supply agreement as well? And will we see more of these purchase agreements from mining companies as other manufacturers enter the space?Obviously, I cannot disclose anything we haven’t yet announced to the public!We’re certainly evaluating all options as they come down the pipeline. [It’s a] good question about purchase agreements. We are the sole authorized repair center in Canada for MicroBT, which has been awesome in terms of getting us closer to the supply chain and allowing us to have a great relationship with a key manufacturer of ASICS. However, we do think optionality is important in this space and so we want to make sure we can build relationships with all suppliers in this industry.How does this change the greater landscape of mining, when a large company like Intel pushes into a space that is largely controlled by a select few, smaller companies?Extremely disruptive. More competition is better because if a supplier can’t compete on technology, they can certainly compete on price.What excites you the most about this announcement, and what is the biggest concern?No concerns because, again, we have fantastic relationships in the traditional technology hardware space. We’re excited to see who comes next after Intel, and of course to see this product in action.Intel entering the ecosystem in a public way and signing a supply agreement this quickly demonstrates the rapid growth of the bitcoin mining industry. We will surely see more manufacturers enter the arena, and likely a decrease in costs as competition in the space grows. Lower barriers to entry will allow for more users to join the mining space, furthering the distributed nature of Bitcoin. Bitcoiners should be excited to see the continued game theoretics play out, and even more excited to see the adaptation of the entire industry. This is a guest post by Shawn Amick.

2022-02-03T22:30:00-05:00,"Currency debasement in Lebanon and cold weather in Texas demonstrate the breadth of the Bitcoin network's utility.The below is a direct excerpt of Marty's Bent Issue #1155: ""Two very different things that highlight Bitcoin's utility."" Sign up for the newsletter here.There are two things going on in the world on opposite sides of the planet that are related to two very different subjects that highlight the incredible utility of the Bitcoin network; the intentional debasement of the Lebanese pound and uncharacteristically cold weather in Texas.As some of you may be aware of already, Lebanon has been embroiled in an economic crisis since 2019 and it seems to only be getting worse as the country's central planners continue to mismanage the crisis. Here is their latest plans to fix their monetary and banking system:via ReutersAfter locking people's money in their bank accounts for almost three years, the government has decided to simply obliterate an estimated $69 BILLION of wealth from the face of the Earth. Forcing people to convert their US Dollars to Lebanese pounds without their permission. All so that they can potentially get their books in a good enough spot in the eyes of the IMF so they can double down on their incompetence by taking out a predatory loan in an attempt to right the ship.Millions of people having their hard earned money disappeared before their eyes. Really sad stuff that is completely avoidable moving forward. The way this can be avoided is by opting into a monetary system that cannot be corrupted by the whims of incompetent politicians and bankers with a lust for printing money. Bitcoin provides that monetary system. If Lebanese citizens decided to begin converting their work to sats instead of the failing pound and put in the effort to secure their own keys, they could have significantly more confidence that they won't be getting rug pulled like that again. There are no incompetent and corrupt politicians or central bankers that are able to corrupt Bitcoin's monetary policy at the detriment of its users. Those Lebanese who were wise enough to convert their pounds to sats before the great bank account freeze of 2019 are doing much better off than their fellow citizens.Bitcoin is a superior monetary system plain and simple.Here in Texas we are experiencing a cold front that is driving temperatures down into the low 20s (Fahrenheit). This is creating a lot of demand for electricity as many across the state begin to turn up their heat to protect themselves from the cold. As electricity demand increases it is important that that demand is able to be met with supply. This is another area where the Bitcoin network can help out via the mining industry.Being able to provide a dispatch-able load of electricity to residential consumers when demand is abnormally high is very important. As I stated in the tweet thread above, Bitcoin miners acting as buyers of first resort for electricity that may otherwise not be generated if there wasn't a buyer presents a great way to ensure residents always have enough electricity as they need to protect themselves from Mother Nature. When demand for electricity increases to a certain point, miners can power down and sell the electricity they would have used to mine to residential consumers - usually at a pretty penny. This is happening today here in Texas as miners like Rhodium and RIOT, who are participating in ERCOT's demand response program, turn off their machines and sell that electricity to the market.The system isn't perfect yet but the opportunity to perfect it is certainly there. There are still a bunch of people LARPing that this is a good way to make grids ""greener"" with more wind and solar, but this argument doesn't make any sense if you think about it for longer than 30 seconds. As we saw last year in Texas when the grid did fail, it did so because the sun wasn't shining, wind turbines froze over, a nuclear power plant had to shut down because of a faulty sensor, and some natural gas lines froze because of human error. In your Uncle Marty's mind, the only way a demand response system works at scale is if the energy that is being overproduced is from reliable sources like nuclear, natural gas and coal.Two mistakes that can be fixed after looking at last year's Texas grid debacle are the nuclear sensor and the natural gas lines, which can be weatherized. No one on Earth can remove the clouds to let the sun shine on solar (coal) panels or prevent freezing rain from grinding wind turbines to a halt.All efforts should be focused on developing more power generation from nuclear and natural gas to add reliable base load to the grid. And who better to incentivize that than bitcoin miners who would be willing to pay for the electricity produced by these load sources when demand isn't what it is right now.It is important that we are honest about the role bitcoin miners play in regards to grid stability and what is actually happening when they do shed load to send electricity to market; they are selling the electricity because it is more profitable than mining because they are able to sell it for considerably high prices because demand is so high.With that being said, let's not stray from the fact that this is an overwhelmingly positive development despite the nuance around the topic. Overtime, it should become clearer how markets should structure these grid projects that cater to miners willing to come in as buyers of first resort. We are watching Capitalism solve an incredibly hard problem and increasing the quality of life for humanity.Bitcoin miners can make grids more secure if we execute correctly and don't try to LARP too much about unreliable ""renewables"".Bitcoin is versatile. It can help those being robbed in Lebanon and those not wanting to go cold in Texas"
2022-02-03T19:30:00-05:00,"Deconstructing the layers of Bitcoin’s architecture shows that it already has the structure to replace our fiat system.This is the third article in a series about lessons that can inform bitcoin’s replacement of the U.S. dollar. Read the first article in the series, on leaving the gold standard, here. And read the second, on dismantling fiat architecture, here.In part two of this series, we discussed the application of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model as an architecture model for understanding the fiat system. In part one, we discussed the abandonment of sound money principles and why that happened. Here, we will discuss a new system, one backed by Bitcoin. Then, the next article will address the reasoning for our abandoning of sound money principles, and how our new system of Bitcoin incentivizes everyone to hold to those principles within the architecture we will discuss today.The OSI model has seven layers, which were all discussed in the aforementioned entry in this series. This particular model didn’t win the battle of networks. It’s more decentralized successor, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), would eventually take over as the internet that we know today for a multitude of reasons, not least of all being a simplification of layering.I will reiterate that this is a conceptual discussion of system architecture with the intention of furthering the discussion of Bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar. I am by no means claiming this as a final financial architecture. My intention is not to provide the final answer of how we replace the dollar, rather my intention is to allow the discussion within the architecture we understand, as we know the only true path to adoption is one of free choice and continued improvement.Since OSI is largely used as a model to understand architecture, and some of its layers are not always used for each application, we will discuss Bitcoin through a lens of the architecture that birthed what we now call “the internet.” This is accomplished through building a similar system to the one used in the last entry in the series, though this system focuses on Bitcoin instead of the dollar, and there are only four layers for TCP/IP. Let’s begin with a short reminder of the seven layers of the fiat system discussed previously:“TCP/IP Network Administration” describes the TCP/IP layers as:Bitcoin’s layers generally follow this architecture, but in a slightly different order.All of the quotes below are from “TCP/IP Network Administration.”This is the base layer of what we will refer to as the Bitcoin standard for the rest of this article, based on the TCP/IP model.“The protocols in this layer provide the means for the system to deliver data to the other devices on a directly attached network… The TCP/IP Network Access layer can encompass the functions of all three lower levels of the OSI Reference Model.” The network access layer of the Bitcoin standard is the foundation of the architecture, represented by the Bitcoin network itself. The first layer of the Bitcoin system, as described with the TCP/IP model, encompasses the first three layers of the fiat system, described with the OSI model: the physical, data link and network layers.The physical layer — though more accurately, the “digital” layer, is represented by the hard assets of combining unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to represent your total holdings of bitcoin create the “physical” layer, though more accurately, we would say it is the digital layer. This is referred to as “on chain,” it moves slowly, it provides security, immutability and a public ledger.The “data link” layer encompasses the idea of transmitting data from one node to another. This is accomplished on the base layer of Bitcoin. Anyone can download Bitcoin Core and start running a node. All of these nodes cooperate and communicate to reach consensus for every block solved in the blockchain. In the fiat standard, the Federal Reserve serves as the central node, and communication systems like SWIFT allow them to communicate with international centralized nodes. This requires so many different trusted entities and the creation of said entities, while Bitcoin accomplishes this system at the base layer by decentralizing the nodes and allowing each node a direct connection to one another.The third layer is the network layer. The Bitcoin standard accomplishes the network on the base layer as well. Since the network is addresses that allow communication between nodes that allow currency to be sent from one place to the next, this clearly takes us to wallet addresses, the place where you hold all of those precious UTXOs we mentioned earlier. When a UTXO is spent, we have a sender, receiver, and signatures to verify the transaction. No central entity is necessary to validate the transaction, and we have a public record. In the fiat standard, this process is centralized and the data is not accessible on a public ledger like it is on the Bitcoin standard. “The Internet Protocol is the building block of the Internet. It’s functions include:• Defining the datagram, which is the basic unit of transmission in the Internet• Defining the Internet addressing scheme• Moving data between the Network Access Layer and the Transport Layer• Routing diagrams to remote hosts• Performing fragmentation and re-assembly of datagrams”The datagram is a UTXO. While Bitcoin is denominated in satoshis or full bitcoin units, the actual data that is being transmitted either on- or off-chain is the UTXO. These data packets that serve as proof that the ""coins"" or UTXOs you possess have not been spent and are therefore available as usable funds. The addressing scheme performs duties mentioned earlier, such as routing transactions between nodes or the remote hosts of the Bitcoin blockchain, but also between layers. The internet layer is often referred to as an “unreliable protocol” because it does not perform its own error detection or recovery code. This isn’t the proper depiction of this layer because it serves as the transition between other layers that provide these much-needed functions. Layer two of the Bitcoin standard allows communication of layer one (network access) and layer three (transport), and utilizes these layers for missing functionalities of the Internet layer.When a transaction is broadcasted on-chain, this means that the transaction has been sent to a singular, or many nodes. As more nodes or remote hosts join in on validating a transaction, it receives security and error detection — security by becoming part of the immutable Bitcoin blockchain once the transactions are lodged firmly within a block, and error detection not by finding errors made by the users, but by creating a system of incentives through penalty keys that demand users only present current channel states from Layer 2 networks like Lightning. This means that the current state is incentivized to be accurate and presented by both parties, disincentivizing errors. Fragmentation occurs through “change outputs.” Fragmented data becomes necessary when data is too large for transference. For example, if you needed to make a purchase and only had one UTXO in your wallet for $30, but the purchase is only for $10, you would need to fragment that UTXO into smaller bits of data. In this example, you would create two transactions, one for $10 that is going to the merchant in order to make the purchase, and one for $20 that will be returned to your wallet address. The total amount of bitcoin held in a wallet is actually an algorithm adding up the sum total of your UTXOs, and each UTXO is probably worth a different amount of satoshis. Since we will not always meet the “coincidence of wants” with the exact amount of satoshis in the perfect amount of UTXOs, we need to fragment the data as required. This is accomplished via change outputs.“The two most important protocols in the Transport Layer are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP provides reliable data delivery service with end-to-end error detection and correction. UDP provides low-overhead, connectionless datagram delivery service.”TCP is the blockchain. The interconnected process of Bitcoin miners adding transactions to the blockchain and nodes validating the transactions added to the blockchain ensures reliable delivery of each transaction with verifiable proof, and provides high-level security in the transactions preventing malleability or error submissions.Transactions can happen on-chain, with Layer 1, or off-chain with Layer 2. The miners and nodes are the transport layer that provide access to whichever layer is being utilized at the time. UDP is easily recognized as Lightning, or other Layer 2 applications on Bitcoin. Low overhead is provided with exceptionally low transaction fees. Lightning does not have an operational cap, meaning an unlimited amount of channels can be opened to create an unlimited scale. The datagram delivery service for UTXOs is maintained by “channels” opened between two willing participants that create a multi-sig wallet of funds to be used for micro transactions that are not connected to the blockchain. Once both parties want to close the channel, it is then broadcast to the transport layer and becomes part of the blockchain. You might be thinking, “Why does it seem like some of this repeats?” It is because the system is not always linear. The open interconnection of the system allows for the best use demanded for the existing scenario. This ability to transact with directional freedom with applications that best serve the transaction is a defining feature of Bitcoin. All processes utilized in the transport layer to deliver data in myriad different ways come together in raw form with their individual intention. Examples of applications include:Many other applications exist and many more are being developed by the day. At this point in the series, we have discussed why sound money principles were abandoned on the international stage, with a focus on the U.S dollar as the world reserve currency. We then talked through the OSI architecture as a way to break down the layers of the fiat system that replaced the sound money principles we abandoned, so we could understand how to replace it. Now, we have shown how, much like TCP/IP beat OSI for the standard network architecture, Bitcoin can replace the current fiat system through the lens of a TCP/IP architecture. Therefore, we can see that not only can Bitcoin replace the current system of fiat, but it already has the systems in place to do so, and in a far more efficient manner. This is not a process of removing the USD as the world reserve currency, nor is it the destruction of fiat altogether. Rather, the system of Bitcoin must exist as a parallel, simultaneous to the system of fiat, and people must choose to adopt this new system. Once adoption and education reach the necessary critical mass, the other system falls without sufficient use. But what of the reasons discussed in the first article of this series for turning our backs on sound money? Have we created the correct systems of incentives to sustain the choices of our past or the haunts of our future? I hope you’ll join me for the next article where we discuss the incentives of the Bitcoin standard, and if we can achieve not only adoption, but sustainability. This is a guest post by Shawn Amick.

2022-02-03T18:00:00-05:00,"As Bitcoin enters the mainstream conversation, it is becoming increasingly common for politicians to embrace or disparage the technology.As Bitcoin moves into its adolescence, many people from all walks of life, from all across the world may be pondering the question: Is Bitcoin mainstream? Is it in the process of becoming mainstream? Or is it something that may never become mainstream?The answer to this question will likely have profound effects on how governments around the world behave toward Bitcoin in its teenage years.The reason that public perception plays a large role in how governments behave toward a certain topic is related to a concept called the Overton window.In this article, we examine the Overton window: What it is, how it relates to Bitcoin, and whether the Overton window for Bitcoin has shifted far enough toward mainstream to warrant support from governments.Wikipedia states, “The Overton window is the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time. It is also known as the window of discourse.“The term is named after American policy analyst Joseph P. Overton, who stated that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within this range, rather than on politicians' individual preferences. According to Overton, the window frames the range of policies that a politician can recommend without appearing too extreme to gain or keep public office given the climate of public opinion at that time.”At the core of the Overton window is public perception. Contrary to what many people think, politicians, at least politicians who want to stay in office, cannot enact any policy they please. Instead, they must choose from a range of policies that are politically acceptable at that time. The Overton window defines that range of ideas.Examples of movements that have shifted from fringe — outside the Overton window — to mainstream include women’s suffrage, racial equality and recreational marijuana use. Once these movements became mainstream, government policies began to align in support of the movements.Now that we have a fundamental understanding of the Overton window, let’s examine how it relates to Bitcoin. Bitcoin turned 13 on January 3, 2022. During its first 13 years, it has gone from a network primarily used by cryptography enthusiasts, extreme privacy advocates, hardcore libertarians and Austrian economic enthusiasts to something used by everyday individuals all around the world, companies small and large and even nation-states such as El Salvador. With the understanding that the Overton window dictates “the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time,” we can then ask ourselves, “Has the Overton window for Bitcoin shifted far enough toward the mainstream to warrant support from governments?” To answer that question, let’s examine the U.S. government's actions related to Bitcoin to date and then extrapolate what those actions may mean moving forward.Contrary to what many bitcoin skeptics may say, in examining the U.S. government actions surrounding bitcoin to date, one would be hard-pressed to find anything overly burdensome. In 2014, the IRS classified bitcoin as property. The United States has some of the strongest property rights of any country in the world. Bitcoin being classified as property affords it the same legal protections as other types of personal property, such as real estate, and is an important reason that some of the largest bitcoin holders choose to own their bitcoin in the United States.In 2017, the CME Group, working in conjunction with the CFTC, launched a bitcoin futures market, an important step for any commodity.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly reiterated that bitcoin is not a security and thus not within their field of regulation. Other cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, may be in for a rude awakening when it comes to SEC enforcement.In 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave federally chartered banks the green light to custody bitcoin.In 2021, the first bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) in the United States was approved. Yes, the ETF is based on bitcoin futures and does not hold physical bitcoin, but the fact that a bitcoin ETF product was approved at all is just another feather in the cap of bitcoin when it comes to favorable regulation in America.So, when we review the totality of government action related to bitcoin in the United States, we can see that the U.S. government has been supportive of bitcoin overall to date. Now let’s turn our attention to what this may mean moving forward for Bitcoin as it relates to the Overton window.With millions of people owning bitcoin, corporations of all sizes owning bitcoin, and evennation-states owning bitcoin, it is clear that Bitcoin has, or is in the process of, passing through the Overton window in many parts of the world. That being the case, the time is ripe for politicians and governments to lean into the Bitcoin movement and use it to their advantage.We’re starting to see the first inklings of this play out. In the United States, politicians such as Cynthia Lummis, Ted Cruz, Aarika Rhodes, Tom Emmer and others are leaning into pro-Bitcoin politics. In doing so, they’re tapping into a large base of voters who care about the issue of Bitcoin more than they do any other issue. This large single-issue voting block is powerful for any politician to tap into, as they tend to be very vocal and, in a world of 24/7 social media influence, being vocal is important. Dennis Porter wrote a great article, “Why Bitcoin Represents The Ultimate Single-Issue Voting Bloc.” I highly suggest you read it here.Another great example of politicians and governments leaning into Bitcoin is President Nayib Bukele and El Salvador. Bukele and El Salvador burst onto the international scene in 2021 when they announced a law that would make bitcoin legal tender. Instead of continuing to be beholden to agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank for funding, El Salvador instead chose to plug into the Bitcoin network. Bukele became internationally recognized almost overnight, and the country of El Salvador went from being a small country, mostly forgotten by the West, to being on the international stage. You can bet that other countries are considering similar actions.Now that we’ve reviewed several examples of politicians and governments taking advantage of the shifting Overton window for Bitcoin, let’s review an example of a government trying to keep Bitcoin out of the Overton window: China.China has “banned Bitcoin” more times than I count. Which makes sense when you think about it. A Communist country run by a dictator doesn’t want its people having access to a global, distributed, censorship-resistant sovereign monetary system? Shocking! However, in 2021, China took its disdain for Bitcoin to a whole new level. They were serious this time. They cracked down on miners, resulting in 50% of the Bitcoin hash rate being relocated to friendlier jurisdictions. They cracked down on exchanges, forcing accounts serving Chinese citizens to be closed. They generally put enough fear into enough people to dissuade many of them from interacting with Bitcoin. China put on a classic display of attempting to keep a movement from shifting into the Overton window. In my opinion, history will not be kind to China for its grave mistake.The Overton window is an important concept to understand. Simply put, the Overton windowdictates a range of policies that are acceptable to the mainstream population for a given topic at a given time. As Bitcoin embarks on its teenage years, and adoption continues to grow, it is clear that the Overton window for Bitcoin has shifted, or is at least in the process of shifting. Politicians and governments around the world will be well served to lean into the Bitcoin movement, use it to their advantage to attract single-issue voters, and to strengthen their position on the global stage. In the United States and El Salvador, we are seeing this process begin to play out. In other countries, such as China, we see attempts to thwart Bitcoin before it can pass through the Overton window. In my opinion, these countries will look back and realize that trying to stop the inevitable was a grave mistake. This is a guest post by Don.

2022-02-03T16:00:00-05:00,"Aid intended to help those in developing countries is often siphoned off with ill intent — but bitcoin can help remedy this.Let’s talk about the humanitarian case for bitcoin — specifically, how it solves issues of government corruption and how it improves the effectiveness of foreign aid.Starting in the mid to late 20th century, western countries began investing heavily in foreign aid. Over the past five decades, wealthy countries have donated more than $4 trillion to poorer countries, with 60% coming from governments and the rest coming from private NGOs, private companies and charitable foundations. While this charity and showing of altruism is inspiring and does a lot of good, there are many obstacles in the distribution of aid that prevent it from fully achieving its goal.The first big obstacle is that foreign aid is often distributed by corrupt, autocratic governments. These rulers roll money off the top, giving it to themselves, their friends, and patrons before giving it to their citizens.The most brazen case of foreign aid corruption is that of the former president of the Congo, Mobutu Seko. Image sourceHe stole foreign aid and bought several mansions across Europe and built an airport at his Congolese home, all while his citizens suffered in a deteriorating economy and abject poverty.And in cases when money is not pilfered illegally, aid can be siphoned off slowly through vast bureaucratic middlemen. Studies suggest that the leakage rate of foreign aid can range:“In one Oxfam study, researchers could only verify that 7% of $28 million in U.S. aid meant for Ghana made it to its destination between 2013 and 2015.” - Alex Gladstein.In other cases, some corrupt, dictatorial governments will block foreign aid, such as the case with countries like Venezuela. Recently, western countries like the United States were supplying aid to revolutionary groups in Venezuela, and in retaliation, the current regime blocked foreign aid to their citizens and shut down the banking system, preventing people from getting the resources they needed.Well, Bitcoin cuts out the middleman when making transactions. With bitcoin, there is no need for governments or banks. When operating with fiat, money has to transfer between various governments and corporations before reaching the end recipient. And through every third party that handles the transaction, money is taken off the top and is exposed to possible theft. But when we use bitcoin, you can donate money directly to the end recipient peer-to-peer, with no middleman necessary. This is because of the blockchain. Whenever a transaction is made, it is recorded on the blockchain, which then can be accessed by the relevant parties. And the information on the blockchain is stored across a series of computers, keeping everything decentralized. This decentralized, free system undermines the need for a middleman to manage transactions. As a result, it is impossible for corrupt foriegn governments to interfere with aid meant for the people. So, if you want to donate to the pro-democracy movement in Venezuela, you can do so with bitcoin, without having to worry about the current regime stealing your money.While the idea of vast government corruption and bank account freezes seem out of the realm for most Americans and western populations, these are problems that billions of people around the world have to endure. Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a beacon of hope for freedom fighters and impoverished communities.This is a guest post by Siby Suriyan.

2022-02-03T15:01:58-05:00,"The company recently passed an independent audit on its bitcoin holdings and has enabled a ‘Proof of Reserves’ feature to its customers.Kraken customers can now independently verify that the bitcoin funds they hold on the cryptocurrency exchange are backed by actual assets after the firm launched its Proof of Reserves feature, enabling a new level of transparency and accountability to emerge in the industry.The feature is the product of an independent, cryptographic audit of Kraken’s funds performed by accounting firm Armanino LLP, which verified the amount of bitcoin the exchange holds on behalf of its clients with the help of Merkle Trees.“Indeed, in this audit, completed on December 31, our auditor determined Kraken controlled all of the bitcoin…belonging to clients on our exchange, as well as all the bitcoin…held in our industry-leading on-chain and off-chain staking services,” the company said in a Thursday statement.Users interested in verifying that Kraken holds the amount of bitcoin that the company claims to hold on their behalf can do so by accessing the independent Proof of Reserves website by Armanino. But first, they should head over to Kraken’s website to gather the necessary information, a unique identification number for their account, for accessing the records.“An advanced cryptographic accounting procedure conducted semi-annually by trusted auditors, Proof of Reserves lets you verify that Kraken is meeting rigorous standards for accountability and exceeding the transparency offered by legacy financial firms,” per Kraken’s website.Proof of Reserves enables greater transparency by providing customers with the ability to check if the custodian of their bitcoin is truthful. The feature isn’t completely trustless, however, as strictly speaking, the user still needs to trust the third-party company that performed the audit.But the initiative is still positive, as it prevents the cryptocurrency exchange from embarking on fractional reserves, and it is also a better deal than what is offered by traditional banks, who not only do fractional reserves but involve full trust."
2022-02-03T14:45:26-05:00,"Bitcoin is a better option than fiat money, said Mexico’s third richest man, Ricardo Salinas, in an interview. Bitcoin, Salinas said, is unseizable and can be transferred instantly worldwide, contrary to fiat and the gold standard.Bitcoin is a better option than fiat money, said Mexico’s third richest man, Ricardo Salinas, in an interview. Bitcoin, Salinas said, is unseizable and can be transferred instantly worldwide, contrary to fiat and the gold standard.“The gold standard has always been subject to governmental intervention,” Salinas said. “And fiat allows you to finance endlessly.”Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer nature makes the digital currency much harder to be banned or controlled as transferring value through the network doesn’t involve an intermediary that could be subpoenaed by the government. This property, paired with its supply limit of 21 million coins, enables bitcoin holders to preserve wealth for the long term in a more sovereign way than what is possible with fiat currencies or even gold.“Everything we have in fiat is 100% seizable by the government,” Salinas added. “It’s not in the government’s interest to make it easy for people to use bitcoin.”Salinas is the founder and chairman of Grupo Salinas, a cohort of companies in the sectors of telecommunications, media, financial services, and retail stores.“We were the first ones to accept bitcoin in our stores,” Salinas said, adding that his companies will soon add support for receiving transactions through the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer-2 scaling solution for cheaper and faster payments.When asked what people should focus on as they start learning about Bitcoin, Salinas said gaining good foundational knowledge about the history of money and fiat currency will help people understand the value proposition of BTC.“There is a lot of confusion regarding money in general,” Salinas said. “At the end of the day, it all boils down to human beings doing really well when we cooperate and work together. Cooperation necessarily means division of labor and specialization, and that must bring trading.”The entrepreneur added that money came about as a means to improve the trading of goods between people as it provided a more liquid and ubiquitous form of value far better than barter, the original way of doing business. Bitcoin, Salinas elaborates, is a better money than fiat and gold because it brings additional qualities.“Gold is hard to transport and hard to store,” he said. “The gold price has been manipulated quite easily by central banks around the world. Bitcoin comes in as a new asset that is harder to manipulate, it’s a better asset as you can sell it easier and you can transport and store it basically for free.”However, Salinas cautioned investors seeking a quick way to make money that he sees Bitcoin as a long-term investment instead, akin to a savings account.“Don’t expect to make a quick buck in 30 days,” Salinas said."
2022-02-03T14:39:17-05:00,"The Ministry of Finance suggested letting banks sell bitcoin while the Chamber of Commerce thinks mining should become an established business.Efforts to welcome bitcoin in Russia with clear regulation keep growing with the Ministry of Finance and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry being the latest two entities voicing their suggestions despite the central bank’s continued hard line.Russian Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov sent a letter to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Wednesday reiterating the ministry’s inclination to regulate, instead of ban, cryptocurrency trading and mining in the country, per a report by Russian newspaper Kommersant.The minister proposed to grant some Russian banks a license that would confer upon them the right to facilitate bitcoin trading, supposedly enabling them to function as bitcoin exchanges.The new regulation would grant cryptocurrencies the status of investment assets, meaning they would be regulated in the same way as cash transactions and transactions with exchange instruments, creating a “white” market, according to the report. Identification of market participants would be mandatory with extensive know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures would be enforced across the regulated cryptocurrency market, removing Bitcoin from the current “gray zone.” Administrative and criminal liabilities would apply to transactions made in the “black” market outside licensed gateways.The Ministry of Finance, in turn, received a letter by the head of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sergey Katyrin, which urged the governmental agency to also move bitcoin mining out of the current “gray zone,” according to a report by Russian news agency TASS.“It seems necessary to make significant revisions to current legislation and also to hammer out a range of new regulatory acts that will determine in particular the legal status of the mining as a kind of business activity, making it possible to exclude this activity from the ‘gray zone,’ ensuring relevant tax and other compulsory payments,” the letter said. “In addition, this will make it possible to defuse tension on matters of illegal electricity use.”President Vladimir Putin backs the Ministry of Finance’s efforts to regulate bitcoin mining and trading despite the central bank’s continued warnings that the industries could pose certain risks to the Russian population.Putin highlighted last week that the country’s energy surplus and well-trained workforce could bring “advantages” to mining bitcoin, asking the Bank of Russia and the ministry to “come to a consensus.”The Russian government has since been making quick progress to expedite regulation in an effort to welcome bitcoin and cryptocurrency businesses and investors by establishing a roadmap for legislation."
2022-02-03T09:08:19-05:00,"The proposed legislation seeks to reduce friction in the usage of bitcoin as a daily currency.A bipartisan bill introduced Thursday would exempt bitcoin transactions from tax obligations if the associated capital gains are $200 or less, seeking to incentivize the digital currency’s usage as a medium of exchange in the U.S. economy. Currently, any gain obtained from the sale of cryptocurrency must be reported as a taxable income regardless of the size or purpose of the transaction.“Antiquated regulations around virtual currency do not take into account its potential for use in our daily lives, instead treating it more like a stock or ETF,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, co-author of the bill, in a statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine. “However, virtual currency has evolved rapidly in the past few years with more opportunities to use it in our everyday lives. This commonsense bill cuts the red tape and opens the door to further innovations, ultimately growing our digital economy.”The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act was co-authored by Rep. David Schweikert and co-sponsored by Representatives Darren Soto and Tom Emmer.“Virtual currency is reshaping our everyday lives, and the United States needs to recognize this and work to treat these currencies fairly in our tax code,” Schweikert said in a statement. “This legislation is an important step forward, and it lays the groundwork for growing the digital economy.”Using bitcoin as a payment method entails a sale for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as the payer disposes of part of its BTC holdings in exchange for a good or service. If the funds being spent had been acquired at a lower U.S. dollar price, the difference would be characterized as capital gains, of which reporting and taxing would be required.The legislation seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to remove these requirements when the capital gain observed doesn’t exceed $200, hence specifically targeting smaller transactions in a push to incentivize, or at least better enable, usage of bitcoin as a means of payment in the U.S."
2022-02-02T19:00:00-05:00,"While the next mayor of New York City has promised to be an ally for Bitcoin, the city is right now one of the most hostile locations for cryptocurrency.Dear Mayor Adams,   I would like to start by congratulating you on your election as mayor of New York City. As you are a lifelong public servant to the city, I can imagine how this opportunity to serve the community feels. Eric Adams was just sworn in as the new mayor of New York City. If you are a fan of Bitcoin, you likely heard that he is an ally. Following Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who has taken a full paycheck in bitcoin, Mayor Adams pledged to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin. Great news for New York crypto enthusiasts, right? Well, New York’s red tape prevents him from accepting that salary directly in bitcoin. Sadly, more than anything, his good intention showcases the Empire State’s many regressive policies towards cryptocurrency. The most well-known payment platform for taking your salary in bitcoin is Strike. Strike, created by Jack Mallers, is used by some of the world’s most prominent figures, like the National Football League player Russell Okung, as their trusted way to accept their salary in bitcoin. Beyond this, Strike is powering payments for citizens in El Salvador, the first nation to legalize bitcoin as tender. So, I assumed that Mayor Adams would use Strike as his way to accept his bitcoin salary. Well, my assumption was incorrect as Strike is unavailable in New York! So, how will Mayor Eric Adams accept his salary in bitcoin? As Kevin Dugan reported for New York Magazine a spokesman for the mayor stated, “He will take his paycheck in dollars and then convert it to bitcoin through an exchange.” Big sigh. Not only is converting his salary to bitcoin rather than getting it paid directly more time consuming, but it also means that he is paying increased sets of transaction fees. If he uses Coinbase, the most prominent exchange in America, that could mean him taking a 2% hit on his salary just in commission fees. What citizen, let alone politician, would want to automatically take less of their money in than they earned?I experienced the ban on Strike first hand when I tried to set up my Bitcoin tip jar with Twitter. Through using the tip jar Twitter’s 200 million users would have a Bitcoin wallet. However, in order to utilize the feature you need to have access to Strike, which is banned in New York and Hawaii. Pretty startling that those are the two states where it is banned. With all due respect to Hawaii, it is not considered to be the financial capital of the world. But, if you live in New York you are being held back from partaking in the growing crypto economy.It isn’t just Strike — many of the biggest crypto companies are unavailable in New York. For example, Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, is banned in the state. This means that citizens of the Big Apple are falling behind in the digital economy. One explanation for the state falling behind in the growing bitcoin ecosystem is due to its negative perception of cryptocurrency. In 2015, bitcoin was considered a pariah after the fall of the online dark web black marketplace Silk Road. In the wake of that, New York State passed a set of restrictions against blockchain companies in New York. Specifically it created the “BitLicense.” Alex Adelman and Aubrey Strobel of Coindesk describe the specific problems with the BitLicense, including that it forces companies to spend “... more than $100,000, surpassing the means of most early stage startups. It includes a 30-page application, $5,000 application fee, thousands of man-hours and the presentation of accounting and records from the last seven years. Of the 20 companies that have been issued BitLicenses, most are multi-billion dollar firms.” This means that entrepreneurs living in one of the world’s centers of capital are unable to build startups in arguably the fastest growing sector of investment. The situation in New York demonstrates the growing divide in the cryptourrency community. There are people aiming to build upon the mission of Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, to create an alternative financial ecosystem for people who don’t want their savings devalued 5% every year by inflation. On the other hand, is a community that wishes to build complex financial products around crypto. For example, some New York hedge funds are creating NFT credit derivatives akin to those mortgage collateralized debt obligations used by the banks that precipitated the 2008 financial/housing crisis. New York is the epicenter of this battle between building an ecosystem for the people, and building another way for the elites to enrich themselves.New York Attorney General Letitia James stated back in March of 2021 “[I’m] sending a clear message to the entire industry that you either play by the rules or we will shut you down.” However, the rules in New York are based on a false and outdated perception. Mayor Adams has shown enthusiasm towards bitcoin — but now is the time to turn words into action. The mayor has to fight to cut the red tape holding back blockchain so that this city, and state, can be a part of the future digital economy.This is a guest post by Jacob Kozy.

2022-02-02T16:00:00-05:00,"Everything about society sets us up to become subservient to the pursuit of the mortgage — but bitcoin changes that.Real estate ownership is the core aspiration driving the Modern Serfdom Model. Debt — and in particular, mortgages — is the mechanism that binds the serf to the system. Inflation covertly moves the finishing line further away each year. This is a game that’s impossible to win. The bad news is it’s getting even harder. But there are two pieces of good news. First, the model is close to its breaking point because home ownership is out of reach for almost all young people. Second, everyone, regardless of age, wealth or circumstances, has bitcoin as an escape hatch. On the system in which we indoctrinate people into this feudalism, Allan Watts said,“...What we do is put the child into the corridor of this grade system with a kind of, “Come on kitty, kitty.” And you go onto kindergarten and that’s a great thing because when you finish that you get into first grade. Then, “Come on” first grade leads to second grade and so on. And then you get out of grade school and you got high school. It’s revving up, the thing is coming, then you’re going to go to college… Then you’ve got graduate school, and when you’re through with graduate school you go out to join the world. Then you get into some racket where you’re selling insurance. And they’ve got that quota to make, and you’re gonna make that. And all the time that thing is coming – It’s coming, it’s coming, that great thing. The success you’re working for. Then you wake up one day about 40 years old and you say, “My God, I’ve arrived. I’m there.” And you don’t feel very different from what you’ve always felt. Look at the people who live to retire; to put those savings away. And then when they’re 65 they don’t have any energy left. They’re more or less impotent. And they go and rot in some, old peoples, senior citizens community. Because we simply cheated ourselves the whole way down the line. If we thought of life by analogy with a journey, with a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at that end, and the thing was to get to that thing at that end. Success, or whatever it is, or maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing, and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.” State school systems are where the Modern Serfdom Model begins. Children are taught to be obedient above all else. They learn to fear authority, not to question things or speak up, that society is controlled from the top down. Of course the consequences aren’t all bad — particularly if you can later harness discipline and self-control to your advantage. But most importantly as it relates to the Model, children are molded to pursue only one course: higher education and a career, while being obedient servants of the state.(Note: this is a deep rabbit hole in its own right. I highly recommend a short TED Talk by Sir Ken Robinson titled “Do schools kill creativity?”, as well as various podcasts and books by Bitcoiners Daniel Prince and Saifedean Ammous.)If you’ve done what you were told to at school, chances are you’re heading to college or university. It’s what you’re supposed to do, of course. You’re told (and don’t question it) that you can’t get anywhere without a degree, let alone a job that pays enough to buy a house. The trap is that it isn’t free,no matter how your government packages and sells it. In many countries there are student loan systems. In others, you (and everybody else) pays through higher income tax rates. In either case, there is a substantial drag on net income post-graduation. For those in the countries with student loan systems, there is a strong incentive to find a secure job as quickly as possible in order to retire the debt. In the U.S. the total outstanding student loan debt is over $1.7 trillion. One in four Americans (approx 45 million people) have student loan debt, averaging over $37,000 each. Numbers in my native Australia are similar where there is almost AUD 54 billion of outstanding HELP debt owed by 1 in 10 people. The average outstanding debt is over AUD 20,000 with many people having debts over AUD 100,000. Try being an 18 year old entrepreneur and getting a loan that size from a traditional financial institution.Notably, not everybody will choose the higher education path. Some will pursue any form of work as soon as possible or vocational training in a trade. This will often be a quicker path to income without the same debt burden. Whether this is leveraged successfully is another matter, but it's worth highlighting that many people find an alternative path for different reasons (not necessarily a direct rejection of the Model).As discussed in my article “Why real estate investors should love Bitcoin,” real estate is unquestionably an emotional asset class. Something that currently performs the dual role of an investment and shelter is inevitably going to be. The Australian movie, “The Castle,” encapsulates this perfectly. With classic lines such as “it’s not a house, it’s a home” and “a man’s home is his castle,” the movie shows that for many people real estate is so much more than an investment. Similarly, home ownership has been a cornerstone of “The American Dream” for decades. Marketing slogans such as “rent money is dead money” are treated by many as investment gospel. The culture of home ownership and real estate investing is something most people have fully bought into and hold dear. It has become the societal norm, even expectation, that you should aspire to own a home. This is why it’s at the center of the Modern Serfdom Model. At state school you were taught not to question these types of norms. And given the rest of the system is designed to push you in that direction, you don’t get much of an opportunity.The word mortgage derives from Old French and Latin; it literally means “death pledge.” Many people will not enter into a mortgage on their first home until well into their 40s. With mortgage terms generally being 30 years (and most borrowers requiring the longest term possible in order to maximize borrowing capacity), they won’t be repaid until many borrowers are well into their 70s. The literal meaning of “mortgage” has never been more appropriate.The mortgage is the key mechanism that enforces the Modern Serfdom Model. It would be impossible for most people to buy a home without a loan. The need to make your regular repayments creates an incentive for a stable, uninterrupted career of employment and disincentivizes entrepreneurial risk taking. In short, it binds you. Of course it is possible to escape. But it's not easy. It's contrary to everything you’ve been taught. And most will never try.After a typical 3-to-5 years of higher education, assuming you’ve hung in that long and graduated, you leave with the credentials that most employers require simply to consider you for an interview. Whether you’ve learnt anything useful is debatable (and degree/school dependant) but that is not the subject of this article. What’s almost certain is you’ve been burdened with substantial debt and will be keen to pay it off. Let’s also assume you want to save for a house because that’s what an adult is supposed to do, right? So how long will it take to retire the loans and make a downpayment? Another 3-to-5 years, by the time you’re 30? Time to crunch some basic numbers.In the U.S., median household income was just under $69,000 in 2019, with the average base salary for a new graduate being just over $47,000 — approximately 30% less than the median household income. The dynamic is similar in Australia where average total annual earnings are just under AUD 94,000 with the average salary being just under AUD 68,000 and the average starting salary for graduates ranging between AUD 55,000 and 93,000 depending on the industry.The U.S. median house price is just under $405,000, approximately 6 times median household income and almost 9 times the average graduate salary. The Australian median house price is over AUD 950,000, approximately 10 times average total earnings and up to 17 times the average graduate salary.Assuming a simple 20% downpayment, a typical graduate needs to save 2 years gross salary in the U.S. and 3 years gross salary in Australia just for the downpayment. That doesn’t sound too bad on face value, but it needs a deeper dive.There are flaws in this analysis; it’s not designed to be perfect but to demonstrate a point. For example, median house prices are more expensive than “starter” homes that younger homeowners might target. Or not doing it on a city-by-city basis so that for major cities, higher salaries (but also substantially higher house prices) are captured. Conversely, the 20% savings rate is possibly generous for most new graduates given the personal savings rate in the U.S. is well under 10%. Personally, I don’t think these things matter because the above snapshot completely disregards inflation. Adding it blows the numbers out of the water even on conservative assumptions. Taking the U.S. example:That’s right, assuming 3% annual growth in net savings (which requires wages to outpace inflation!) and only 5% growth in house prices (well short of the 15-20% levels in most of the world today, but in line with the 30-year average), it would take 21 years to save for the deposit. Again, this is imperfect, but the point is it doesn’t take 2.1 years!To pre-empt criticisms, some people may receive much larger salary increases over time due to promotions or job changes, i.e. at some point they may reach or exceed the average household income (but not necessarily before they have finished saving for a down-payment). Interest or investment earnings on the savings is also excluded. Interest rates are effectively zero presently and there are trade-offs for riskier investing of the downpayment. Also, some households may have savings rates in excess of 20%. For example, there will be dual-income, childless households saving towards this goal, which will greatly accelerate the process (although many would argue this dynamic is a direct response to the problem being discussed). The numbers are for a typical single person, not an outlier or high performer. Therefore, for most people even getting the keys to a mortgaged home is an increasingly difficult mountain to climb. It should be clear that inflation makes it even harder.There’s starting to be a widespread recognition that most young people will take decades to save for their first home. For example, research in the U.K. found half of all 20-35 year olds would still be renting in their 40s and a third by the time they claimed their pensions (timelines that make sense based on the high-level analysis above). As the World Economic Forum says, “you’ll own nothing. And you’ll be happy.”Doing what was the cultural norm and societal expectation has now become highly aspirational and unrealistic for many who will give up trying or set their sights on a different goal. This alone has the potential to break the Modern Serfdom Model even without the interference and existence of the most perfect alternative: Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s value, whether it be measured in fiat currency terms or purchasing power, is designed to pump forever. It benefits from what is colloquially termed Number Go Up (NgU) Technology. Due to its fixed supply of 21 million coins, it will ultimately be the most scarce asset that has ever existed. Bitcoin preserves and grows the value of your savings relative to all other assets due to the powerful combination of this scarcity and its adoption curve. It breaks the Modern Serfdom Model:Ultimately bitcoin breaks the Modern Serfdom Model by being a superior store of value than real estate. The state and legacy financial system fear it for good reason: it dismantles their mechanisms of control at every level.This is a guest post by James Santi.

2022-02-02T14:50:19-05:00,"Watch This Episode On YouTubeListen To This Episode:In this episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s “Fed Watch',' I flew solo without co-host Christian Keroles, but got to interact with the live stream fellows at Bitcoin Magazine, Q and Alex, and answer some questions from the live audience.Topics for this episode were the new nominees for the Federal Reserve board, the Arizona bill to make bitcoin legal tender, Evergrande and China, and finally, the IMF forecast for GDP in 2022.This month, President Biden announced his nominees to replace Rosengren, Kaplan and Quarles at the Federal Reserve, three board members who stepped down in 2021. Of most note was the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to fill Quarles’ vice chair seat and his role as head of supervision.This is a controversial nomination, because Raskin is a radical progressive. She served at the Fed previously during the Obama administration, so is no stranger to the Fed. She is a big supporter of using Fed policies and powers over banking regulations to promote a progressive political agenda, like climate initiatives.Raskin also draws a hard line on bitcoin and private sector digital alternatives to the USD. She favors the unrestrained use of Fed regulatory powers to control bitcoin and other innovation in the currency space. As for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), it is safe to say that she’d agree with those other progressive central bankers like Christine LaGarde, who want to pursue a CBDC.In our coverage of the Arizona bill to make bitcoin legal tender, I recapped the situation and put it in context of GDP size. The Arizona GDP is $375 billion, whereas the El Salvador GDP is $25 billion.As for the legal issues, it is plainly unconstitutional, because the states are not allowed to make anything other than gold and silver legal tender. In an interesting turn, would the federal government actually pursue Arizona in this case, since the current USD does not fit the definition either? We’ll have to wait and see how this turns out. What we can say now is that it is a big win already for bitcoin in shifting the Overton window to include this debate.Long-time listeners of “Fed Watch” will know that we talk about China a lot. In this episode, I gave a quick update on things happening right now in regards to the communists, Evergrande, and real estate in general.This month, state-owned enterprises (SOE) were exempted from the three red lines in a de facto, slow motion nationalization of the real estate market in China. This is a big change in how the real estate industry in China is structured, and marks the end of growth in my opinion.Another development we covered is the gigantic secondary market of suppliers around the real estate industry starting to go under. Each large developer in China has an army of suppliers for furniture, plumbing, electrical, metal, concrete, landscaping, etc. These dependent companies are no small fish either. Some of them can be $1 billion companies.I used this as an example of how central planning never works. These are the second- and third-order effects that those technocrats and authoritarians on high do not or cannot take into account.I ended by using the IMF GDP forecasts for 2022 to circle back on the Federal Reserve and its predicted policy path for 2022. Will the Fed be able to raise rates in the middle of the year when the global economy is slowing and everywhere things are slipping back into recession?This is an important time for the bitcoin economy to attract capital flight from the atrophy of the legacy economy, and show what it's made of.This is a guest post by Ansel Lindner.

2022-02-02T12:08:30-05:00,"The initiative by Paxful will teach Salvadorans about Bitcoin and related topics for free.Peer-to-peer bitcoin platform Paxful has launched an educational center in El Salvador to help citizens learn about and better utilize Bitcoin. The initiative, called La Casa Del Bitcoin, aims to propel bitcoin adoption with free knowledge as the majority of the Salvadoran population still struggles with the technology.Paxful said in a Wednesday statement that the center would provide the population of San Salvador, El Salvador, with free training and events that increase awareness around the benefits of having bitcoin as a medium of exchange in the local community.“The center will further drive the next wave of Bitcoin mass adoption and equip growing segments such as small merchants and local businesses with tools to connect to a global community of users,” the statement said.Classes and training will go live to the public starting Thursday, February 3, as the center welcomes anyone interested in better interacting with Bitcoin and Lightning.“Peer-to-peer platforms are driving adoption in emerging markets, and as a people-powered platform, we understand that education is crucial to the next wave of adoption,” Paxful CEO Ray Youssef said in a statement. “The center will provide education, accessibility and opportunity to a population that has been ignored by traditional finance, and demonstrate the real-world benefits of Bitcoin to emerging markets.”In addition to providing educational resources, the center will also house offices of Paxful and of Built With Bitcoin Foundation, a humanitarian organization devoted to leveraging Bitcoin to create equitable opportunity through clean water, access to quality education, sustainable farming, and humanitarian support.“The projects that we are launching demonstrate the power of Bitcoin as a philanthropic tool to aid change and further financial freedom,” the director of philanthropy of Built With Bitcoin Foundation, Yusuf Nessary, said in a statement. “We’re grateful for the opportunity to deliver resources and continue building equitable opportunities for countless people and communities who bring our mission to life.”Paxful is a global peer-to-peer platform founded in 2015 for people to make payments, transactions, and send money by buying and selling Bitcoin as a means of exchange. Youssef and Nessary later teamed up to set up the Built With Bitcoin Foundation to support emerging markets; to date, the nonprofit has built and repaired eight schools, seven solar projects, and over a dozen water and farming systems worldwide."
2022-02-02T11:19:17-05:00,"Listen To This Episode:The hosts of ""Bitcoin Bottom Line,"" Steven McClurg and C.J. Wilson, discussed regional and digital banks with the CEO of Fourth Capital, Brian Heinrichs, in this most recent episode. Fourth Capital believes in combining digital tools with the human touch. It strives to be a type of bank that has never been built before with its creativity, ideas, process and customer service. Heinrichs explained that Fourth Capitol is unique because it is privately held, with single shareholders, and does not plan on going public.There are two segments within banking today: there are the large, incumbent, national, regional players, and there is the community bank player. Fourth Capital believes that banking should be about sitting down with your client, meeting their needs and doing research to make it happen. Heinrichs ensures a “yes” mindset to his clients.Wilson talked about banks encouraging people to have their stock portfolios attached to their savings accounts to incentivize them to trade more. It is currently challenging to operate in a Bitcoin-only lifestyle with zero cash, but some individuals hope society will progress to this system.Heinrichs discussed how the organization's objective fundamentally changes how it functions as a business and treats clients. Traditionally, funded banks have all started from the premise of “how do we make money?” They want your wealth co-mingled with your bank account so they can get fees. They do this to make money without keeping their customer’s best interests in mind. Heinrichs stated, “Fourth Capitol wants to be best in terms of what they do and add value to their clients. If we do that long term, there is a mutual benefit of their clients getting rewarded through their business, and we get rewarded through long-term relationships.”Heinrichs states that a segment of the market is not being banked because individuals cannot find the experience they want, or they believe in an alternative financial world that we do not live in yet. Being financially inclusive is a long-term value play that benefits Fourth Capital and clients.McClurg, Wilson and Heinrichs all reflected on Nashville's past and the rapid growth of the city over the past ten years.Heinrichs expanded on the values that Fourth Capital holds and how clients are often surprised by how the business operates. Unlike many traditional banks who send applications to a nameless or faceless credit committee to make decisions, there are a handful of employees that sit down and decide together. “Get away from the formula and bring in the human element. At the end of the day, it is a people business,” said Heinrichs.McClurg asked Heinrichs where he sees Bitcoin going, what it will be used for and how it will be integrated into our everyday lives or banks. Heinrichs believes that you have your very early adopters, the next wave is people wanting exposure and seeing where it goes, and then it will eventually be adopted and used in many different places. He believes that banks need to evolve and begin using better technology.The episode wrapped up with a brief explanation by Heinrichs on the credit facility and how credit has evolved in both private banks and the financial sector."
2022-02-02T09:38:32-05:00,"Bitcoin events are great expressions of the Bitcoin ethos and critical touchpoints for newcomers and technology innovators alike.Bitcoin conferences and meetups are great expressions of the Bitcoin ethos and culture. They come in all varieties, from casual drinks meetups, to formalized talks and panels, to small-scale conferences, all the way up to the biggest events that see tens of thousands of attendees.I’m a believer in building Bitcoin communities and meetup groups, because of the connections you make, the things you learn and the experiences you have. These are highly valuable for many reasons. Newcomers (newcoiners) often don’t even know what questions to ask, so they learn by coming and soaking up the discussion of regulars at the meetup. Regulars enjoy the discussion of various aspects of Bitcoin, whether that is technology, economics, the social and cultural impacts of fiat money or other aspects. Now, when it comes to conferences with a ticket price, one argument that confuses me is the people who say, “Don’t pay for an overpriced conference ticket, you can just see the talks for free online.” Yes, it’s true that many Bitcoin conference teams will live stream the event or post the videos online afterwards, but seeing this content is not the only or even the main reason to go. This is like arguing that “you shouldn’t go see that singer live, you can just listen to their music for free on YouTube or Spotify.” There is overwhelmingly an audience of people who want to see it live, and they will happily pay for this. While there are some who argue that you should just consume material online for free, I think this is missing the point. The benefit for newcoiners is that they’re receiving guidance. It’s a steer in the right direction regarding who to follow, what hardware and software Bitcoin tools to use, what books to read, which podcasts to listen to, etc. By hearing speakers and meeting other like-minded Bitcoiners who have spent time going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, you can quickly get up to speed on what you need to know. Take advantage of the curation of the conference organizers, who ideally vet and invite speakers who have something useful or educational to say. There’s also a selection bias involved because the more committed people are the ones who will travel for an event. This is vastly different from merely trusting what is reported about Bitcoin in the corporate media, or trusting YouTube’s recommendation engine. The YouTube recommendation engine will often point you to the overly-excited people who talk about whether bitcoin’s price is pumping or dumping that day, but it won’t necessarily point you in the direction of learning about the philosophy, economics or technology of Bitcoin. There’s a certain magic to meeting up with a bunch of like-minded people that you get from Bitcoin meetups and conferences. In many cases, people who attend Bitcoin conferences or events soak up the vibe and community ethos, and later go on to host their own Bitcoin meetups and conferences. I’m reminded of how my friend @BTCSchellingpt attended Baltic Honeybadger in Latvia, and went on to become a co-organizer of Bitcoin events in Australia, such as Bitcoin Brisbane and Bitcoin Bush Bash. This is part of how Bitcoin is spreading virally. Without having in-person events to go to, newcoiners who have only been exposed to material online might not feel like they’re part of a bona fide community or group. Some of the people who argue that conference tickets are overrated are probably the kind of people who have already “graduated” from beginner level. But even here, they might benefit from staying up on the latest tech or business ideas. For them, the benefit might be more about networking and meeting cool people in the space, or it could even be making connections that enable you to work or hire in the space. For some, it’s just a matter of selecting the right event. The biggest event on the Bitcoin event/conference annual calendar would surely be Bitcoin 2022 by the BTC Media team, with tens of thousands of attendees (disclaimer: BTC Media operates Bitcoin Magazine). But there are definitely a range of events to suit different tastes and interests. Let’s overview some:LaBitConf is the big one in terms of South America, as this conference has been running since 2013 and regularly features big names. With the bigger audiences, you will find more newcoiners as attendees, whereas the smaller conferences tend to be more ideologically aligned with long-time Bitcoiners and/or with those looking to build their technical knowledge. But if you go into them with the right expectations, then you can have a great time at both types of event.If you’re looking for a smaller and perhaps more focused event, perhaps BitBlockBoom in the U.S. or Baltic Honeybadger in Latvia (by the Hodl Hodl team) for the European bitcoiners would be right for you. Historically, these tend to have somewhere in the range of 300 to 900 attendees. Depending on how technical you want the focus to be, you might enjoy technically-focused events that come up, such as Advancing Bitcoin in London, Adopting Bitcoin (recently in El Salvador) or TABConf ( in Atlanta). Or, of course, look for regular Socratic seminars or BitDevs meetups that exist as regular meetups. For instance, you might look to NYC BitDevs, SF Bitcoin Devs, Austin BitDevs, Chicago BitDevs, Sydney Socratic Seminars (started by yours truly, but now hosted by my friend Lloyd Fournier) or London Bitcoin Developers. If you’re looking for more hands-on events and workshops, you can typically find these as side events to larger conferences, and occasionally done as one-off events by companies or individuals in the space, such as my friends Jimmy Song or Giacomo Zucco. For larger events, the conference doesn’t just start on the day of, the fun starts beforehand. There will be side events: some official, some unofficial. You’ll get great opportunities to run into interesting people at these, and you might even get a chance to meet people who you might not have otherwise. Keep an eye out for side events that will be fun or educational. These might take the form of a workshop or community meeting, or it could simply be a drinks meetup. You’ll make new friends or see old friends that you can then catch up with later at the actual conference. Don’t be afraid to say hello to new people at Bitcoin events. You’ll have a better time of it once you build up friend groups and connections. Part of the fun is the shared experience that happens in the side conversations, after parties or over food and drinks while out. So, don’t be afraid, most people there are also interested to meet like-minded individuals. You might find yourself making some random connection or bonding over the shared experience of singing karaoke in a bar nearby. For all you know, these connections could lead to you finding a job in the space, or making new friends who can help you with Bitcoin questions that come up later down the line. Bitcoin Twitter characters will also be around, so this is a chance to meet them in real life. Most Bitcoin conferences have chat channels, such as a Telegram channel. Join that so you get updates, or you can quickly ping and find out where people are and what’s going on. If the entry price is a bit steep for you, consider volunteering at the event. Yes, you’ll spend time doing errands and moving things, or corralling speakers, but you’ll have an interesting experience and a chance to meet people this way, too. You’ll want to bring a small amount of bitcoin with you on your mobile phone wallet. This will be handy if you want to buy things at the conference, or pay people back for lunch/dinner (it’s typical that one person might cover the bill and everyone else pays them their own shares over Lightning). Lightning wallets are ideal for these scenarios just because of the speed, ease and low cost they provide.Don’t talk too much about your personal life, especially where you live or where and how you hold your coins/keys. As Jameson Lopp says, talk about bitcoin, but do not talk about your bitcoin. While at the conference, some attendees prefer to use a burner phone with an eSIM not connected to their personal identity. Security-conscious attendees generally don’t connect to the Wi-Fi and they will use mobile data instead. Don’t leave personal items or devices unattended. As Bitcoin OG Mandrik once told me, embrace becoming irrelevant at some point. For me as a Bitcoin podcaster, writer, etc., I fully acknowledge that someday, there won’t be much use in solely being a “Bitcoin podcaster.” This makes about as much sense as being a “money podcaster.” But for now, Bitcoin is an “industry” in its own right. Over time, many sub-fields of Bitcoin today will simply merge into their broader fields of society. For example, Lightning-focused technologies might fold into payments or other entrepreneurial conferences and events. Mining might end up merging with energy conferences, with mining hardware merging into hardware conferences. Decades from now, Bitcoin protocol development might become something like web-protocol and standards-setting boards. Economics discussions will take place at economics events and conferences. There will be fortunes won and lost in this industry, and there’s so much to be done. As Ron Paul says, money is half of every commercial transaction. So, whether you’re a developer, entrepreneur, investor or you work in some other capacity, there are lots of opportunities. There’s work to be done helping people secure their coins, helping people pay in or receive sats as merchants or as employees, there’s privacy technology to be developed and technology that will help Bitcoin scale to billions of users. Conferences and meetups are a great way to get involved, or stay up to date. Enjoy it while it lasts!This is a guest post by Stephan Livera.

2022-02-01T22:30:00-05:00,"It's been one hell of a week for the ""Make Bitcoin Legal Tender"" movement across North America.The below is a direct excerpt of Marty's Bent Issue #1153: ""The 'Make Bitcoin Legal Tender' momentum grows."" Sign up for the newsletter here.It's been one hell of a week for the Make Bitcoin Legal Tender movement across North America. Late last week we had the state of Arizona get a bill brought to its floor that would make Bitcoin legal tender in the state if passed.via the State of ArizonaEarlier today Aly Hamam, the co-founder of the Tahinis Restaurants chain in Canada gave an impassioned speech to the House of Commons Finance Committee to suggest that bitcoin should be made legal tender in Canada.Both efforts will probably fall short of achieving their goals in the short-term. The Arizona bill will likely fail because it is technically unconstitutional for a state to make anything outside the US Dollar or precious metals legal tender. If your Uncle Marty recalls correctly, Wyoming wanted to make bitcoin legal tender but had to back off from such a proposal because of the constitutional issues described above. It will be interesting to see if the state of Arizona pushes the bill forward and enacts it into law. We'd find out real quick just how scared the federal government is of Bitcoin and states asserting their autonomy.In the case of Canada, it doesn't seem very likely that the Canadian government is too keen on diverting from their path of insane money printing and granular control over Canadian citizens, which is best wielded via the monetary system. However, I really love Aly's framing of Bitcoin as a sound money technology that can grow alongside the Canadian Dollar and help bring Canada further into the Digital Age.While these actions may not directly make bitcoin legal tender in Arizona or Canada in the near-term, they do serve as a very strong signal to the US and Canadian federal governments that there are many people who would like to see bitcoin designated as legal tender and, more importantly, as an essential ingredient for societies looking to move forward into the Digital Age. This may not seem like much but it goes a long way. Especially in regards to getting those who are hopeful to get elected to office to begin pandering to bitcoiners, which is a very wealthy and quickly growing sector of voting bases in the US and Canada.We're seeing this across the US with states like Wyoming, Texas, Arizona, Kentucky, North Dakota, Michigan, Arkansas and many others openly attempting to court bitcoiners with tax breaks and favorable regulatory environments. Expect this competition to heat up as more individuals voice their desire to hold and use bitcoin as a human right. Many don't realize it yet, but these efforts seem to be pretty effective and should be accelerated. At the end of the day, politicians are placed by the individuals who voted for them and voters can use their voices to move politicians in a certain direction. Thai citizens proved this earlier today.via the Financial TimesIf enough individuals put enough pressure on politicians it seems as though we can create a solid protective cover for Bitcoin as it matures on its way to making government regulations ineffective due to its robustness.Keep pushing forward. Eventually Bitcoin will be recognized as legal tender globally and from there we'll be able to do even more to reduce central points of control that are leveraged by those in power to mess things up for the Common Man."
2022-02-01T19:30:00-05:00,"The Federal Reserve recently outlined its considerations for a U.S. CBDC, confirming that it would be diametrically opposed to Bitcoin.“This paper is the first step in a public discussion between the Federal Reserve and stakeholders about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).”–“Money And Payments: The U.S. Dollar In The Age Of Digital Transformation,” Federal ReserveQuotations throughout the article will come from the above article unless otherwise linked, which was written by the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve. It can be concluded that the board’s intentions are to begin a narrative around CBDCs as it relates to the Federal Reserve and USD that falsifies expectations around how this technology would function. On January 20, 2022, the Fed released its long-awaited outline of CBDCs. Cryptocurrency markets were going red, and bitcoin stood relatively resolute (though the price was dipping, of course). The purpose of this article is to discuss the Fed’s conceptual outline and intentions as it relates to Bitcoin based on this outline, as, ultimately, CBDCs and Bitcoin are diametrically opposed. “Federal Reserve policymakers and staff have studied CBDC closely for several years, guided by an understanding that any U.S. CBDC should, among other things:Keep these points at the forefront of your mind as we explore the undertakings of the Fed: protect privacy and garner support from key stakeholders. “Irrespective of any ultimate conclusion, Federal Reserve staff will continue to play an active role in developing international standards for CBDCs.”The idea of “digital privacy” increasingly presents itself as an oxymoron for the standard user of a CBDC. China has already piloted its CBDC, and it began research for it in 2014. Paired alongside its social credit system, the CBDC has become a tool for the surveiler. Gone are the days of worrying about someone seeing your search history, now governments want to establish currencies of digital surveillance maintained by a network of good behavior in which they set the rules to determine your worthiness. This isn’t just China, or America, or any one country. Here is a CBDC tracker that shows 87 countries currently developing or researching CBDCs, and the Federal Reserve “will continue to play an active role in developing international standards” for every single one of them. This global oversight of CBDC technology development is horrendous. Every cent of a CBDC comes complete with a surveillance bundle and goodwill tokens that say the government plans to make sure your money is safe, secure, and most importantly, not yours.“While the Board of Governors is an independent government agency, the Federal Reserve Banks are set up like private corporations. Member banks hold stock in the Federal Reserve Banks and earn dividends.” –”Who Owns Reserve Banks,” Federal Reserve Bank Of St. LouisIf the Fed wants buy-in from “stakeholders,” then they want support from the people who hold reserve bank stock, such as member banks. As for the public? No need. It will get public support from the congress that “represents the people.” Your opinion means nothing in this decision-making process.“CBDC would differ from existing digital money available to the general public because a CBDC would be a liability of the Federal Reserve, not of a commercial bank.”The liability, or more accurately, ownership of funds; able to be rehypothecated, tracked and controlled, would belong to the Federal Reserve, not banks. What does this mean? Let’s use a Bitcoin lens. Banks in the fiat world act as exchanges in the bitcoin world, for a simple analogy. The exchange holds all of the actual assets, and you are rewarded an IOU as a participation trophy for providing liquidity to the exchange. You hold a claim to the asset, not the asset itself. Banks are the same, Anyone who uses a bank or spends money on a daily basis has a settlement period, because all transactions are based on these IOUs, which is why fiat final settlement requires a lengthy waiting period (sometimes weeks). What do I mean by “the banks own your funds?” Here you will see the Federal Reserve removed the reserve requirement on March 15, 2020. In short, the reserve requirement is the total amount of actual reserves (money) required for banks to keep on hand, based on a percentage of their deposits. Relative to the amount of claimed dollars they say they have access to, they are required to have none of that on reserve. This incentivized ridiculous leveraging and massive bank expenditures as they needed to hold less capital on-hand. Point being: once the reserve requirement disappeared with 0% rates, banks made bank. This happened because they control the funds and can move them wherever they want and do what they want, so long as their digital IOU that shows in your online banking account keeps saying what you expect it to. Your money was used to make them money while they made a computer tell you how much money you had, when they had no incentive to actually have that money in reserve. CBDCs would give this power and ownership to the central bank, or Federal Reserve. What happens to the banking industry then? Even the Fed sees banks wouldn’t be necessary. “CBDC could also pose certain risks and would raise a variety of important policy questions, including how it might affect financial-sector market structure.”And isn’t there a word for a centrally-planned economy? I’m sure I’ll remember later, and I’ll be sure to put it in my manifesto.“Commercial bank money has very little credit or liquidity risk due to federal deposit insurance, the supervision and regulation of commercial banks, and commercial banks’ access to central bank liquidity. Nonbank money lacks the full range of protections of commercial bank money and therefore generally carries more credit and liquidity risk. Central bank money carries neither credit nor liquidity risk, and is therefore considered the safest form of money.”So, commercial bank money is low risk because it is insured, and central bank money doesn’t need to be insured because they can just create more of it. The definition of monetary safety hinges on insurance and its security is based on fully-autonomous inflationary practices to solve liquidity issues.“As a liability of the Federal Reserve, however, a CBDC would not require mechanisms like deposit insurance to maintain public confidence, nor would a CBDC depend on backing by an underlying asset pool to maintain its value.”Translation: “No real value is needed because we will print more of it if we screw up.”We all know that the real reason the Fed wants to create a CBDC is because, “Another potential benefit of a U.S.-issued CBDC could be to preserve the dominant international role of the U.S. dollar.” It’s just about staying on top. This paper presents selling points for CBDCs like instant pay, cross borders access, digital security and privacy protection, which were already provided by Bitcoin. The differences are Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone, nation states cannot achieve surveillance through Bitcoin and Bitcoin is thermodynamically-backed monetary energy that requires actual expenditure to create. The fiat CBDC is the direct opposite because there are no expenditures for its creation which allow it to be an infinite unit, nation states can use CBDCs to achieve the highest level of financial surveillance and the fiat CBDC is controlled by the central node (Federal Reserve) and its operators (the Federal Open Markets Committee Board of Governors, U.S Treasury, Congress, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, etc.). “... an interest-bearing CBDC could result in a shift away from other low-risk assets, such as shares in money market mutual funds, Treasury bills, and other short-term instruments. A shift away from these other low-risk assets could reduce credit availability or raise credit costs for businesses and governments.”Translated, this means the “low-risk” investments typically held by those who already have massive amounts of capital would lose their value if the fiat CBDC provided any amount of savings capacity. Low-risk investments wouldn’t serve the money makers well if the CBDC operated as a stablecoin that provided an interest rate for providing liquidity. By design, the CBDC does not need your liquidity, therefore the Fed would have no reason to reward you for providing it. It can create at will when necessary. Since it doesn’t need your liquidity…“These concerns could potentially be mitigated by CBDC design choices. A non-interest-bearing CBDC, for example, would be less attractive as a substitute for commercial bank money. In addition, a central bank might limit the amount of CBDC an end user could hold.”Didn’t miss that last sentence, did we? “A central bank might limit the amount of CBDC an end user could hold.”If the central bank gets to tell you how much money you’re allowed to hold, and it would also be able to set stipulations that required you to spend the money in the timeframes that it would create, it is not your money. You don’t control how much you can have. You don’t control when you spend. You don’t own your money. Not only do you not own the money, but it won’t be as safe as the current banking model (which is already pretty risky). “Designing appropriate defenses for CBDC could be particularly difficult because a CBDC network could potentially have more entry points than existing payment services.”Devil’s advocate for a moment: One could argue the Fed states limiting CBDC funds is a way to maintain the old form of digital dollars. I find this point of view to lack base, as a purely digital form of money would completely overtake its analog predecessor, which is the entire purpose of its creation to begin with.Let’s recap: In a CBDC world, you don’t own your money, the money the Fed allow you to use becomes a surveillance tool, you can’t save as much as you want because the Fed can step in and set limits on your money, financial market structure upends as we see the wasted resources, stakeholders and elected officials will make this decision for you, and the effort to make CDBCs is a global initiative being overseen by big brother that is less secure because there’s one, gigantic point of failure. Bitcoin cannot be controlled, manipulated, surveilled or otherwise contorted by malicious ne'er-do-wells, and it is antipodal to central bank digital currencies. This is a guest post by Shawn Amick.

He added that the policy also weakens the effect of U.S sanctions, therefore enabling “malign actors,” including China and organized crime.“This new policy has the potential to weaken U.S. sanctions policy, empowering malign actors like China and organized criminal organizations.”Similarly, Senator Cassidy raised concerns over emboldening money laundering cartels. He calls for action to keep alive the dollar’s world reserve status.“If the United States wishes to combat money laundering and preserve the role of the dollar as a reserve currency of the world, we must tackle this issue head on.”The bipartisan trio wants an analysis of the impact of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law as it pertains to cybersecurity, economic stability, and democratic governance in El Salvador. They also want “a plan” to counter the potential risks of the Law.Reading between the lines, it seems as though the Senators are, 1) worried that Bitcoin is already disrupting U.S hegemony, 2) have made their minds up before the analysis, as demonstrated by calling for a counter plan at this early stage.<a href=""https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1494066643625988107"">President Bukele fired back in a tweet asking U.S Senators to “stay out” of El Salvador’s internal affairs. He also made clear that his country is not a U.S outpost or satellite state.“OK boomers…You have 0 jurisdiction on a sovereign and independent nation.We are not your colony, your back yard or your front yard.Stay out of our internal affairs.Don’t try to control something you can’t control.”Diplomatic relations between El Salvador and the U.S have been strained ever since the White House condemned cases of corruption in Bukele’s administration.The incident in question relates to the <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-56970026"">removal of senior judges who opposed President Bukele’s stay-at-home order as a response to the health crisis.<a href=""https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1466527805152370692"">El Salvador has unrestricted access for travelers with no vaccine/passport mandates, or any testing requirements to enter.With that in mind, it’s tricky to argue El Salvador isn’t a free and democratic nation.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Feb. 14, 2022  10:00 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCIf price follows hashrate should we expect an incoming spike in the Bitcoin price?Photo by SnapLaunch on PixabayThe Bitcoin hashrate hits a 7-day average of 201.3 terahashes per second (TH/s), making a new all-time high. This represents a 20% increase since the start of the year when the 7-day average came in at 168.2 TH/s.What’s more, the raw values show a significantly higher hashrate, peaking at 248.1 TH/s on February 12.The Bitcoin price has been trending downwards since early November 2021. But a recent <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-breaks-12-week-downtrend-whats-next/"">downtrend break has investors optimistic that a corner has been turned, more so now when taking account of the rising hashrate.Nonetheless, the macro matters, and as global economies tetter on what some say will be the next great depression, is it too much to expect a significantly higher Bitcoin price from here on?<a href=""https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/everything-you-should-know-about-bitcoin-mining-d62c5a20d10a"">Bitcoin hashrate is a measure of the network’s total computing power with which to mine and process transactions.Before new transaction data can be added to the next block in the chain, miners must compete to guess a number. More accurately, miners attempt to produce a hash (or string of alphanumeric code) that is equal to the “target” hash by changing a single value called a “nonce.”This process leads to competing miners firing millions of millions of guesses a second to hit the target hash and win the right to fill the next block. The winner scoops up the block rewards (currently 6.25 $BTC per block) and the associated fees of the transactions written in that block.The hashrate is thought of as a metric to determine the network’s health and level of security. The more machines are tasked with discovering the next hash target, the higher the hashrate, and the harder it is for bad actors to attack the network.A high hashrate signifies that miners hold positive sentiment over the network. Does that mean we should expect a price increase on the way?The relationship between hashrate and price is hotly contested. Both <a href=""https://minerdaily.com/2021/btc-price-follows-hash-rate-no-not-necessarily/"">Willy Woo and Max Keiser are of the opinion that price follows hashrate. Meaning, a rising hashrate will lead to the Bitcoin price rising.However, critics cite a variety of reasons why this isn’t an accurate way to evaluate the relationship. For example, some say the primary determinant of Bitcoin price is the interplay between the forces of supply and demand. Which is not something that directly affects miners joining or leaving the network. Advocates of this view say its hashrate that follows price, not the other way.In any case, since sinking from all-time highs, fears over what happens next are of significant concern. Especially so against a backdrop of economic woes in which Bitcoin appears closely correlated with stocks.Speaking to Stansberry Research last month, <a href=""https://youtu.be/VqtGk6St9yk?t=1673"">Keiser addressed this by saying Bitcoin is already uncorrelated. As for what happens next, he sees the Bitcoin price going to infinity, as it “51% attacks” global energy and usurps fiat, alts, and gold in the process.“Bitcoin is already decoupled. It’s on its own vector, it’s not correlated to anything…Bitcoin is a 51% attack on global energy, so 51% of all global energy will be dedicated to Bitcoin and this will starve to death all fiat money, sh*tcoins, and gold.”<iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""281"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqtGk6St9yk?start=1673&amp;feature=oembed"" title=""Max Keiser Says His $220,000 Bitcoin Call Is Coming, Plans to Exit Gold and Silver Completely"" width=""500""></iframe>As contagious as Keiser’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin is, this is a bold call to make. Especially at a time when $BTC isn’t showing overwhelming strength.No doubt, more will be revealed in 2022 as central banks play out their end game.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

DeFi activity shrunk while the prices of BTC and ETH dropped. However, one asset grew faster than ever.According to <a href=""https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/january-2022-report-fp-a7a47cc4-6042-42ec-ae84-51646d4b0fc1?this_month=2022-01-31&amp;last_month=2021-12-31&amp;date_range=2021-01-01~2022-01-31&amp;daterange=2022-01-01~2022-01-31&amp;channel=u-QytebM#secret=14C75CD43534F26187CAABA82A84507D"">Footprint Analytics, <a href=""https://www.footprint.network/guest/chart/de-fi-tvl-fp-a37c3efc-bca0-4597-9880-43b59080de66?channel=u-QytebM#secret=984D0F73DA11425C67B402ED9682F122"">DeFi‘s TVL failed to exceed $300 billion, instead dropping to $204.79 billion, a 22% decline MoM.  BTC and ETH crashed again, while <a href=""https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/nft-dashboard-fp-b374b358-6e2f-4587-a52b-a69ebbb91bfa?channel=u-QytebM#secret=DA601985B1CD8DCF912829C1188A05AA"">NFT market volume soared to a new high in January, up 239%.The price of BTC fell 17.3% from $46,472 to $38,430 in January. ETH fell 27.4% from $3,695.6 to $2,684.75, with the highest daily trading volume of the month at $29.31 billion. On the 22nd, BTC and ETH set eclipsed their September 2021 low.The crash was mainly influenced by policy announcements from various countries. Examples include the Federal Reserve’s tightening of monetary policy, the Bank of Russia’s proposal to ban the use of cryptocurrencies, Pakistan’s ban on cryptocurrency, and other countries’ strict regulation of BTC, from mining and trading to online marketing.As BTC and ETH prices fell, it drove top lending protocols such as AAVE, Compound, and MakerDAO to trigger massive liquidations around Jan. 7 and 21, with $425 million liquidated. Due to the overall decline in the cryptocurrency market, TVLs fell 22% in January from $264.22 billion to $204.79 billion MoM. Data from Footprint Analytics shows, the TVL of bridge projects increased by 30% , which did not contribute much to the overall <a href=""https://www.footprint.network/guest/chart/de-fi-tvl-fp-a37c3efc-bca0-4597-9880-43b59080de66?channel=u-QytebM#secret=984D0F73DA11425C67B402ED9682F122"">DeFi TVL  increase due to its small percentage.Blockchains are competitive and each has its own way to capture the market. In January, Terra’s TVL had overtaken BSC several times as the 2nd place. But at the end of the month, BSC overtook it to regain second place.Fantom’s TVL reached a historical high on Jan. 25, locking in $8.9 billion at a 93% growth rate, jumping past Avalanche ($8.62 billion), Solana ($8.07 billion) and Polygon ($4.67 billion) to the top 4.Fantom’s TVL hit an all-time high for the following reasons：Curve is the number one DeFi platform by TVL and focuses on trading stablecoins. The drop in BTC price has driven other cryptocurrencies like ETH down, but has had relatively little impact on the prices of stablecoins like USDT and USDC.The top 5 positions continue to be held by popular projects such as Maker DAO, AAVE and Convex Finance.With token prices falling due to the regulatory environment, speculative capital flowed into the NFT market for collectibles, games and art. This led to unprecedented activity in the NFT space, with trading volume reaching a new high of $8.52 billion.According to Footprint Analytics, Meebits saw a spike in transactions between Jan. 11 and 21, with volume reaching $200 million to $350 million. Meebits is a 3D virtual world game by Larva Labs, the development team of Cryptopunks. The second most traded NFT project was Terraforms, and the third was Loot.Veteran NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, Cryptopunks, Art Blocks, and Axie Infinity had a relatively stable daily trading volume.The number of investments in January was down 55% MoM and the amount invested was down 38%.  In terms of investment sectors, the DeFi sector had the lowest decrease compared to December, while the NFT and Web3 sectors had the highest decreases, 66% and 70%.Influenced by new policy proposals and regulations, the crypto market entered a downturn in January. Mainstream cryptocurrency prices fell, with BTC and ETH hitting lows. DeFi’s TVL fell 21% MoM, implying a strong correlation with the biggest tokens.However, the decline in ETH prices has contributed to NFT trading, prompting speculative capital to flow into the NFT markets for collectibles, art and gaming.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feb. 2022, <a class=""__cf_email__"" data-cfemail=""89dfe0e7eaf0c9efe6e6fdf9fbe0e7fda7e7ecfdfee6fbe2"" href=""/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"">[email protected] — <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Data Source: Footprint Analytics –<a href=""https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/january-2022-report-fp-a7a47cc4-6042-42ec-ae84-51646d4b0fc1?this_month=2022-01-31&amp;last_month=2021-12-31&amp;date_range=past1months~&amp;daterange=2022-01-01~2022-01-31&amp;channel=u-QytebM#secret=14C75CD43534F26187CAABA82A84507D""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">January 2022 Report DashboardFootprint Analytics is an all-in-one analysis platform to visualize blockchain data and discover insights.

"Feb. 11, 2022  10:00 am","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThe Norwegian mining operation is as green as it gets.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<p class=""p1"">Kryptovault, a Norwegian data center provider and operator, is also the largest Bitcoin miner in the country. The company’s 54,000 square feet farm, located some 40 miles west of Oslo, has put itself at the forefront of the battle for Bitcoin and is pushing back at the prevailing narrative about the unsustainability of mining.<p class=""p1"">The company operates 6,500 miners but plans to have 15,000 at work by this autumn—all without spending a single kilowatt of non-renewable energy.<p class=""p1"">A recent <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/09/can-bitcoin-be-sustainable-inside-the-norwegian-mine-that-also-dries-wood"">report from The Guardian explored Kryptovault and its push to make mining a more sustainable business, noting the very specific circumstances that make that possible.<p class=""p1"">Namely, the company’s huge mining operation is located in Norway, where 99% of the energy comes from renewable sources, mainly hydropower and wind power. In years of heavy downfall, Noway also has an extremely large <a href=""https://www.statkraft.com/newsroom/news-and-stories/archive/2019/energy-do-we-have-enough-power-to-face-the-future/#:~:text=%22In%20a%20'normal%20year',say%20for%20the%20power%20balance."">energy surplus—sometimes as high as 20 terawatt-hours (TWh). The combination of renewable energy and an energy surplus, as well as the country’s Nordic climate, make Norway a perfect home for large-scale mining operations.<p class=""p1"">What started out as a hobby turned into a full-fledged business for Kjetil Hove Pettersen, Kryptovault’s CEO, who believes it’s now time for the mining sector to fight back against unsustainability claims.<p class=""p1"">Pettersen believes that Bitcoin mining has gotten a lot of bad press recently, with almost all of it being unsubstantiated. Bitcoin mining, when well regulated, provides significant economic returns both for the businesses doing the mining and the country it operates in. Aside from being a big source of tax revenue, mining operations also require a highly-skilled workforce, raising the wage and living standard of its employees, he explained.<p class=""p1"">Mining also offers a way for countries with an excess of renewable energy from hydro, wind, or solar power to avoid costly energy exports. Pettersen said that a mining operation like the one Kryptovault operates can help state energy producers make value of their energy surplus.<p class=""p1"">When it comes to the question of the amount of energy mining uses, Pettersen noted that most of the reports regarding Bitcoin mining have been exaggerated.<p class=""p1"">“If you look at the total energy cost, globally, for any given thing, it’s always going to be huge – I think we can always compare to that of a small European country,” he said. “That includes also traditional gold mining, which takes more than four times the amount of energy as bitcoin mining.”<p class=""p1"">With some estimates showing that the proportion of <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-mining-council-says-56-of-all-mining-is-sustainable/"">renewable energy used in Bitcoin mining could go as high as 75%, any talks about the <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/report-bitcoin-mining-carbon-emissions-contribute-nearly-0-08-globally/"">polluting effects of mining are unsubstantiated, Petterson added.<p class=""p1"">“Mining is not polluting in itself. If you are running coal to run mining then that’s another story, that’s what you don’t want. Mining should be done in more than places like Norway – and it can be a way to save trapped energy. For example, in northern Norway where there is excess, or in El Salvador where they are now using energy from volcanoes, setting up production when it wasn’t there before.”<p class=""p1"">Sourcing the energy required to power Bitcoin miners from renewable sources only solves half of the problem.<p class=""p1"">Bitcoin mining is done on hardware powered by ASIC chips, which release a large amount of heat. Back in 2018, Kryptovault used huge fans to cool down the 9,500 rigs it operated at the time, which sucked up a lot of electricity and produced an incredible amount of noise. The noise problem got so serious that the local municipality <a href=""https://www.thelocal.no/20180821/norway-council-may-shut-down-noisy-bitcoin-miner/"">threatened to shut it down.<p class=""p1"">Since then, the company has installed more than $2 million worth of noise insulation and has largely solved the problem that threatened its operation.<p class=""p1"">The noise insulation, however, didn’t solve the problem of the excessive heat produced by the rigs. To close the circle of sustainability, the company created a network of corrugated pipes that funnels the heat outside of the plant—and into dozens of containers of wood.<p class=""p1"">This rather ingenious way to get rid of heat has made Kryptovault a pioneer when it comes to sustainable mining.<p class=""p1"">The company provides wood drying services to local lumberjacks for free. The amount of heat produced by the rigs also means that wood takes only a few days to dry out completely, despite the drying process taking place outside, often in snow and rain.<p class=""p1"">Earlier this month, the company had 12 containers of wood drying behind its Hønefoss plant, located in a former paper mill. Pettersen said that they are currently transitioning to new miners, which are being shipped from China. The new contingent of machines will be three times more efficient than the rigs Kryptovault currently runs—and most likely give off significantly more heat. The 15,000 miners the company plans on running by this fall will more than double its wood drying capacity.<p class=""p1"">Kryptovault’s efforts to close the loop of energy use have the potential to sway Norwegian regulators. Bjørn Arild Gram, Norway’s regional development minister, told The Guardian that the government was currently “reviewing its options” when it comes to regulating the mining sector.<p class=""p1"">“Although crypto-mining and its underlying technology might represent some possible benefits, in the long run, it is difficult to justify the extensive use of renewable energy today,” Gram said. “The ministry of local government and regional development is currently reviewing potential policy measures in order to address the challenges related to extensive energy usage caused by crypto-mining.”Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

This means that crypto would be integrated into the financial system, and users will only have access through the banking system and licensed intermediaries.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earlier this year, the Bank <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/russias-central-bank-releases-a-damning-report-proposing-a-blanket-ban-on-crypto/"">called for a blanket ban on Cryptocurrencies, citing several reasons why such is necessary. Reasons included its use for crime and its speculative nature.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But many members within the government kicked against such a move, claiming it’ll set Russia back in the quest to stay conversant with the technology. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Ministry of Finance even went as far as to submit a regulatory framework on cryptocurrency.  Several other government stakeholders, including the parliament, also supported regulation instead of outright banning.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With this report, it appears that the Central Bank has finally compromised on its stance against crypto. In its proposed regulatory framework, the Ministry of Finance has also advised an integration of crypto into the banking system. The draft of the new crypto law incorporates this as well.<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/if-russia-regulates-the-market-moscow-could-pocket-13-billion-in-crypto-tax-each-year"">Regulatory clarity on crypto has become necessary in the country amidst the large investments of residents. Russians hold up to 2 trillion rubles in crypto-assets, and there’s a general and growing awareness around crypto in the country. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A recent poll by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (Vtsiom), revealed that 64% of Russians have heard about Bitcoin, and only 19% know nothing about cryptocurrency.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The move to regulate crypto also seems to have the blessing from Russian President Vladimir Putin. He had recently called on the Bank and government authorities to compromise. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As part of the proposed laws, any transaction exceeding 600,000 rubles (around $8000) must be declared. Non-declaration would constitute a criminal offense. The law also intends to criminalize those who illegally accept crypto as means of payment.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Feb. 9, 2022  7:45 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThis day 11 years ago, bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar. Those who were fortunate, or clever, enough to buy bitcoin at $1, and managed to HODL on to it, have made a handsome profit since.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the 9th of February 2nd, 2011, eleven years ago today, the price of bitcoin (<a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">BTC<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) reached a market value of exactly $1, a little over two years after the first Bitcoin blockchain block was created in early 2009.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the very early years, there were only two ways to obtain bitcoin — by mining it yourself or arranging a peer-to-peer trade via a forum like Bitcointalk, which Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto founded to host Bitcoin-related discussions.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Back in those days, peer-to-peer trades were risky given they required trust between the transacting parties, but the stakes were not as high as they are today because each bitcoin was worth virtually nothing. The first bitcoins were transacted for zero dollars and reached an early peak in 2010 at 39 cents.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By 2010, interest in Bitcoin had grown and new methods for obtaining it emerged. Bitcoin core developer <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/people/gavin-anderson/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gavin Andresen<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> created a bitcoin “faucet,” a website that would give anyone with a Bitcoin address five bitcoin for free. It was at this time that the first bitcoin exchanges emerged.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first “real” bitcoin exchange, Bitcoin Market, was announced on the Bitcointalk forum in 2010 and it launched the same year, offering a floating exchange rate for bitcoin. Before this, there was no bitcoin market to speak of, and thus no way of establishing a floating market valuation of the bitcoin currency. Buyers could purchase <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/jpmorgan-bitcoin-is-trading-above-fair-value-what-does-this-indicate/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">bitcoin<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> by sending another user U.S. dollars via PayPal while Bitcoin Market would hold the seller’s bitcoin in escrow until the seller received their money.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most notable exchange to emerge in 2010 was the now infamous <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/companies/mt-gox/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mt. Gox<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The Japan-based exchange was hacked in 2014 with a devastating effect on many users, and the exchange went bankrupt not long after.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 2011, several new bitcoin exchanges appeared. VirWoX, an exchange for buying and selling Linden Dollars, the currency of the popular virtual reality game Second Life, began facilitating trades between Linden Dollars and bitcoin.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tradehill, another exchange, allowed users to purchase bitcoin “instantly” instead of submitting limit orders on their exchange. Tradehill enabled users to deposit funds via wire transfers and various payment processors.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After reaching $1, the price of bitcoin increased rapidly over the following three months, peaking at $29.6 on the 7th of June – a 2,960% gain. In what would turn out to be a familiar pattern till this day, a sharp recession in the market followed, and Bitcoin’s price bottomed out at $2.05 by mid-November 2011.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Those lucky, or stubborn, few who acquired bitcoin at $1, and managed to HODL on to it, have, of course, made a handsome profit since. It’s easy to multiply from $1 to any market price through the history of Bitcoin. The market price of bitcoin reached its thus far all-time-high on the 10th of November at just over $69,000.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Feb. 9, 2022  11:19 am","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThe couple has been accused of allegedly trying to embezzle $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin that had previously been stolen from the Bitfinex crypto exchange in 2016.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlateThe US Department of Justice announced Tuesday that the law enforcement authorities have captured a married couple linked to the Bitfinex crypto exchange hack incident in 2016.The married couple, Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his Wife Heather Morgan 31 were arrested by US law enforcement and are accused of allegedly trying to launder Bitcoin funds worth $3.6 billion.The US law enforcement officials accredited the incident as one of the largest financial thefts ever to have taken place. The following theft is also connected to a previous Bitfinex crypto exchange hack, that resulted in the exchange losing nearly 119,756 Bitcoin.In 2016, approximately 119,756 <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/report-north-korea-funded-missile-program-using-stolen-crypto/"">Bitcoin was stolen from a leading virtual crypto exchange Bitfinex, which at the time was valued roughly $78 million. At the time of writing, the current prices of the stolen Bitcoin hover close to $4.5 billion, making it one of the most critical thefts to have ever been performed.The US Department of Justice(DOJ) further disclosed the <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470186/download"">details, stating that the DOJ was able to retrieve the stolen funds after IRS-criminal investigation special agents conducted a thorough inquiry and issued court-authorized search warrants of online accounts linked to Lichtenstein and Morgan. The warrants permitted the authorities to seize files with private keys of the couple to access core details and wallets that held stolen Bitfinex funds.“Those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from Bitfinex, and allowed special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94,000 bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex. The recovered bitcoin was valued at over $3.6 billion at the time of seizure,” The US Department of Justice further added.In a statement issued by Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A Polite Jr, he further stated that the arrest made today shows that the authorities are vigilant towards such crypto hacks and will not tolerate cryptocurrency to become a medium of <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/money-laundering-0-05-of-all-crypto-transactions-in-2021-chainalysis-report/"">money laundering-related incidents.“Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow the money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system,”  Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division added.The official <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470186/download"">documents filed with the court concerning the incident, outline the detailed account of the sophisticated techniques used by the couple in an attempt to launder the stolen Bitfinex funds.The tactics include setting up fictitious accounts and using computer programs to automate funds. Later on, the funds were sent to Lichtenstein wallet using a complex series of transactions that were meant to make the Bitfinex funds obscure and hard to detect.The official complaint defines the accused Lichtenstein as a tech entrepreneur, who possesses the citizenship of both the US and Russia. Similarly, his wife’s LinkedIn profile says that Heather Morgan is a serial entrepreneur. The couple has been <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency"">charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which comes with a punishment that can land the couple in prison for up to 20 years.Following the news of the Feds recovering Bitfinex funds, the exchange took to Twitter to issue a general <a href=""https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/766"">statement, extending their support and cooperation to assist the Department of Justice in any future investigations.<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">We’re pleased that DOJ has announced recovery of a significant portion of the bitcoin stolen during the 2016 hack. <a href=""https://t.co/voGmFUkYoY"">https://t.co/voGmFUkYoY— Bitfinex (@bitfinex) <a href=""https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1491093052299292673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">February 8, 2022<script data-cfasync=""false"" src=""/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js""><script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"">Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

The crypto asset allocation is a first-of-its-kind investment for the accounting and advisory company.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlateAccounting and advisory giant KPMG in Canada has completed an allocation of crypto assets to its corporate treasury, the firm’s first direct investment in crypto assets. The investment “reflects the firm’s commitment to emerging technologies and asset classes and the investment illustrates the firm’s outlook on emerging technologies underpinned by blockchain.”According to a KPMG <a href=""https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/kpmg-in-canada-adds-bitcoin-and-ethereum-to-its-corporate-treasury-851778842.html"">press release, the allocation includes bitcoin (<a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"">BTC) and ether (<a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/"">ETH), as well as carbon offsets to maintain a net-zero carbon transaction to deliver on the firm’s stated environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments.The press release does not disclose the amount of the investment. Also, the reader should note the emphasis on “KPMG in Canada” – as far as CryptoSlate can tell, the investment does not apply to KPMG globally.KPMG in Canada acquired its bitcoin and ether on its balance sheet through <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/companies/gemini/"">Gemini Trust Company LLC’s execution and custody services.“Cryptoassets are a maturing asset class,” says Benjie Thomas, Canadian Managing Partner, Advisory Services, KPMG in Canada. “Investors such as hedge funds and family offices to large insurers and pension funds are increasingly gaining exposure to crypto assets, and traditional financial services such as banks, financial advisors and brokerages are exploring offering products and services involving crypto assets.”“This investment reflects our belief that institutional adoption of crypto assets and blockchain technology will continue to grow and become a regular part of the asset mix,” Benjie Thomas continues.To ensure the investment was in line with corporate checks and balances, <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/big-four-accountancy-firms-clamp-down-on-employee-crypto-disclosures/"">KPMG, according to the press release, established a governance committee to provide oversight and approve the treasury allocation.This committee included stakeholders from Finance, Risk Management, Advisory, Audit and Tax, and it undertook and completed a rigorous risk assessment process that included a review of regulatory, reputational, and custodial risks. KPMG specialists also assessed the tax and accounting implications of the transaction.“The crypto asset industry continues to grow and mature and it needs to be considered by financial services and institutional investors,” says Kareem Sadek, Advisory Partner, Cryptoassets and Blockchain Services co-leader, KPMG in Canada.“We’ve invested in a strong crypto assets practice and we will continue to enhance and build on our capabilities across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse, to name a few.

Wyoming’s Cynthia Lummis and Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey were the only two US senators invested in cryptocurrencies.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, with his January purchase, Cruz joined the

the transaction.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This in mind, the following weeks could reveal some new names joining the Bitcoin boosters in the US Congress, who, similar to Cruz, recognized the

Benjamin Dichter, a spokesman for the truckers, said an estimated 35,000 to 50,000 trucks are participating in the demonstration.The convoy hit Canada’s capital, Ottawa, on <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60281088"">January 29, where the truckers set up shop, paralyzing the center by blocking roads.During this time, mainstream media has reported incidents of hate and violence from the protestors. A claim dubbed “gaslighting authoritarianism” by liberal author <a href=""https://twitter.com/JamesMelville/status/1489015076229206019"">James Melville.Based on these reports and at the behest of local law enforcement, <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/gofundme-backtracks-canadian-trucker-money-fraud-investigation-threat"">GoFundMe froze the campaign’s funds, which came in at over <a href=""https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/ottawa-truckers-and-bitcoin"">CAD$10,000,000 (US$7.9 million) at the time.“On Friday, the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe froze the convoy’s official campaign, claiming law enforcement convinced the company that the convoy had become violent and unlawful.”In a further blow, GoFundMe decided not to process automatic refunds. Instead, the popular crowdfunding platform said donors would need to submit a form to get their money back.They later withdrew this requirement, saying they will now return the money automatically.However, Texas Attorney General <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/gofundme-backtracks-canadian-trucker-money-fraud-investigation-threat"">Ken Paxton said via social media that he had assembled a team to investigate GoFundMe on fraud and deception charges.Nonetheless, the damage to GoFundMe’s reputation has already been done, and once again, the susceptibility of centralized platforms is shown for the whole world to see.With no way to access funds to keep the protest alive, shrewd Canadians have turned to Bitcoin via <a href=""https://tallyco.in/"">Tallycoin.“Tallycoin is a crowdfunding platform built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.”The platform says it takes no cut from donations and its companion node software means campaigns receive all the donations directly to their own dedicated node.By cutting out the middleman, in favor of peer-to-peer transactions, both on-chain and via the Lightning Network, the truckers can access funding without fear of authorities stepping in.The truckers are currently <a href=""https://finbold.com/canadas-truckers-turn-to-bitcoin-as-gofundme-ceases-9-million-in-donations/"">deciding how best to spend the money. The word is fuel and food are the top priorities at the present time.According to <a href=""https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1490485884243877888"">Bitcoin Magazine, so far, donors have raised 6.37 $BTC ($272,000 at the current price) since Tallycoin took over the campaign’s funding from GoFundMe.A look at the Tallycoin website shows that figure has since increased to <a href=""https://tallyco.in/s/lzxccm/"">8.8 $BTC, thanks to over 3,900 donors, making it the number one campaign on the platform.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

From peak to trough YTD, Bitcoin has suffered a 30% loss in value.The turning point came on January 23, as $BTC began grinding higher. However, small candle bodies suggested a distinct lack of conviction on the part of bulls.It wasn’t until Friday just gone that the bulls made a decisive move, spiking the price from $37,300 to $41,800, closing the day slightly down from the top at $41,600.On that event, sentiment per the <a href=""https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"">Fear &amp; Greed Index moved from a rating of 20, classed as extreme fear, to 45 today, not far from neutral territory.The question is, is this the start of a major trend reversal?According to <a href=""https://youtu.be/H9c8FRZ55EI?t=132"">Davis‘ analysis of the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the signs are looking positive. He noted a break in the RSI downtrend, with momentum rocketing much higher over the weekend.Davis points out the last time this happened, around mid-July 2021, a 130% price rally followed, including new all-time highs.“Are we going to see a 130% price rally now? That would be awesome, who knows? But what is evident is that we have definitely broke out of this downtrend and that when we’ve had these RSI downtrends been broken out of previously, they have come right before a major price rally.”Although the technicals show support for a reversal, what about on the fundamental side?Recently, following El Salvador’s steps, there is talk of <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/fidelity-expects-more-sovereign-nations-to-acquire-bitcoin-in-2022/"">another sovereign nation also legislating for Bitcoin as legal tender.While there’s no further news on that front, rumors suggest it will be another <a href=""https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/news-analysis/4042778/devere-green-bitcoin-legal-tender-countries"">Latin American country next.

Porter then says more states will follow, by which time the third is announced Bitcoin will be at $1,000,000.While $100,000 seems somewhat achievable, $1,000,000, at least from our current stand point, might be a step too far.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Feb. 5, 2022  6:00 am","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCAn investigation by Glassnode shows that merely 6 out of 18 crypto exchanges have fully adopted the SegWit Bitcoin update activated back in 2017. As exchanges are the biggest consumers of Bitcoin blockspace, SegWit adoption by exchanges is important.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Segregated Witness, or SegWit for short, is a Bitcoin protocol extension that was activated on the network in August 2017. The primary reason for introducing SegWit is to increase the scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain. Before SegWit was activated, the Bitcoin network often ran into congestion issues due to users filling up the one-megabyte block size of Bitcoin blocks.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To mitigate congestion and increase network throughput, SegWit improves two key variables. One allows for smaller transactions so that more transactions can fit into a fixed amount of block space, the other key variable allows for larger blocks, which also enables more transactions to fit into each block. Taken together, these improvements increase the overall throughput of the <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/report-bitcoin-mining-carbon-emissions-contribute-nearly-0-08-globally/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bitcoin<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> network.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Presented in a new <a href=""https://insights.glassnode.com/segwit-adoption/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">article<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, blockchain analysts Glassnode has investigated the adoption rate of SegWit by the major crypto exchanges. The reason why exchanges are important to SegWit adoption is that exchanges are large consumers of Bitcoin blockspace, and if exchanges adopt SegWit, they will consume less blockspace than without SegWit and to a large extent contribute to better overall performance of the Bitcoin network.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to Glassnode, exchanges are responsible for about 40% of all consumed block space, and their stance toward SegWit has a significant impact on Bitcoin’s scalability. Binance and Coinbase alone represent approximately 25% of consumed blockspace.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, Glassnode finds that a large majority of exchanges has not managed to fully adopt SegWit, most importantly <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/companies/binance/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Binance<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, who are single-handedly responsible for consuming about 15% of Bitcoin block space.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In their study, Glassnode assesses Bitcoin transactions flowing in and out of exchanges, and how these transactions utilize SegWit. The study then segments the examined exchanges into three categories: Pioneers with over 90% adoption, Stragglers with between 20% and 90% adoption, and Holdouts with less than 20% SegWit adoption.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The investigation covers 18 exchanges, and of these exchanges, six have fully adopted SegWit, six are still struggling with wide-scale SegWit usage, and six exchanges have made little effort regarding SegWit adoption.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coinbase in particular, with the exchange consuming 10% of all Bitcoin blockspace consumption, has near full SegWit adoption.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of all exchanges, Binance and <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/company-news/coinbase/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coinbase<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> combined are the biggest block space consumers by far. Transactions to and from Binance alone are responsible for about 15% of all block space.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to the study:<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Binance has had trivial SegWit adoption rates of only 10% up until the end of 2021. Although recently, adoption has surged to about 50%. This number seems inadequate, especially when considering that Binance alone consumes around 15% of all Bitcoin block space,” <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to the study, the 18 exchanges fall into these cohorts, in falling order of SegWit adoption:<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of the exchanges in the Holdouts cohort, “with an adoption rate of 7%, <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/companies/okx/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Okex<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is the only exchange that qualifies as having made at least some nominal attempt to adopt SegWit. The same can not be said about any of the remaining exchanges, who are clearly signaling a lack of interest to upgrade their infrastructure to the benefit of the wider Bitcoin network,” the study concludes.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

Fireblocks raised over $500 million in January, and its valuation is now around $8 billion. Blockdaemon, a rival to Fireblock, raised $155 million, and its valuation is now $1.3 billion.Interestingly, Crypto and blockchain-related startups cumulatively raised around $25 billion in 2021 as venture capitalists and investors alike looked to leverage the rising popularity and adoption of the space by the public.However, with the value of assets falling sharply to new lows, investors appear to remain drawn to the industry, as can be seen with the level of investments already seen in the space within the past month.Available data from PitchBook would show that startups in the blockchain and crypto sector raised almost the same amount startups in Africa raised in 2021.Speaking on this, the CEO and co-founder of Fireblocks, Michael Shaulov, said that the crypto market “has been volatile from the very beginning.” However, he believes that “investment in the infrastructure is not going to stop.”An indication that investors share Shaulov’s sentiment could be seen with Dune Analytics’ recent revelation that it raised over $69 million from investors and is now valued at $1 billion.While crypto startups were enjoying inflows from venture capitalists, <a href=""https://medium.com/coinshares/volume-64-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-476321bd4b5d"">data from CoinShares also shows that digital asset investment products saw inflows for a second week totaling $19 million.According to the data, the flagship digital asset, Bitcoin, saw an inflow of $22 million while Ethereum continued its outflow streak as investors withdrew $27 million from the asset.This means that for the last eight weeks, investors have now cumulatively removed $272 million from ETH-investment products.The report also highlighted that multi-asset funds saw inflows of around $32 million while blockchain equity investment products saw inflows of $15 million, which shows that investors are looking to diversify their investments approach.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Feb. 3, 2022  8:00 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThe former Twitter CEO gives his take on why Facebook Diem failed.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-01/dorsey-says-zuckerberg-should-have-focused-on-bitcoin-instead"">Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Block Inc, formerly Square Inc, tells Mark Zuckerberg he should have focussed his efforts on Bitcoin instead.Dorsey was referring to Zuckerberg’s failed Diem project, which finally threw the towel in after U.S regulators refused approval.Diem’s assets were sold to <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/silvergate-swoops-in-with-200-million-bid-on-failed-diem-project/"">Silvergate Bank earlier this week, marking the end of the project. Silvergate said it plans to utilize the technology and workforce to launch its own stablecoin offering later this year.Speaking at the MicroStrategy World Conference, Dorsey said Diem was a waste of time and effort. And according to the former Twitter boss, it was all down to one key aspect.Affiliation with Facebook meant the beleaguered Diem project was off to a poor start from the beginning.Interest from partners was initially buoyant, with household names including Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, and PayPal signing up for a piece of the action. But things soon turned sour as lawmakers and regulators voiced their concerns.In most cases, the dominant concerns centered around Facebook leveraging its already considerable influence on global financial markets. And based on the company’s track record with data privacy, this was a step too far for authorities.After a <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735171/facebook-novi-diem-libra-calibra-cryptocurrency-digital-wallet-zuckerberg-senate"">hearing on the matter, senators banded together in a rare show of cross-party unity to urge Zuckerberg to pull the plug.“Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient.”Fast forward to now, and a <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-by-diem-ceo-stuart-levey-on-the-sale-of-the-diem-groups-assets-to-silvergate-301471997.html"">press release on Monday confirmed the end by announcing the sale of Diem assets to Silvergate Bank.Assessing the situation, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-01/dorsey-says-zuckerberg-should-have-focused-on-bitcoin-instead"">Dorsey implied Diem was always doomed because it focussed on growing a closed-off ecosystem.“They tried to create a currency that was owned by Facebook — probably for the right reasons, probably for noble reasons — but there were also some reasons that would indicate trying to get more and more people onto the Facebook ecosystem.”He continued by saying Zuckerberg could have successfully achieved his digital currency ambitions if he had piggybacked off the open Bitcoin network, instead of going the route he did.“Those two years or three years, or however long it’s been, could have been spent making Bitcoin more accessible for more people around the world, which would also benefit their Messenger product and Instagram and WhatsApp.”With Meta’s development in full swing, time will tell if Zuckerberg has learned his lesson.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

Meanwhile, on-chain demand models suggest a more bullish undertone is in play, according to on-chain analysts Glassnode.“As a percentage of the Bitcoin market cap, open interest in perpetual swaps is hovering around 1.3%, which is historically high, and often as precursor to a deleveraging event,” Glassnodes writes in this week’s <a href=""https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-05-2022/"">newsletter.At the same time, funding rates have traded negative for much of January, Which may indicate a short bias in perpetual swap markets. A similar negative trend can be seen in options markets, with a multi-month high put/call ratio of 59%; an indication that traders have shifted towards buying downside insurance.“With this observable shift from long into short bias across derivatives markets, the dominance of futures liquidations has started to creep towards the short side. With high negativity, elevated leverage, and an overall short bias, a reasonable argument could be made for a potential counter-trend short squeeze in the near-term,” the newsletter reads.Looking at the demand side of the market, the number of non-zero <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategy-to-hold-second-edition-of-bitcoin-for-corporations/"">Bitcoin wallet balances is on the rise. The current trend of non-zero wallet counts appears to be largely unaffected by the last three months of depressed prices, with wallet count hitting a new all-time-high of 40.16 million addresses.Though bitcoin market price has been on a decline for the past weeks, retail size wallets, wallets holding less than one <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"">BTC, appear unfazed by this correction, with supply held in these wallets continuing to climb. Given Bitcoin’s history as a grassroots phenomena, this speaks to a growing class of “sat stackers” who remain throughout all market conditions.Another trend on the positive side is that funds are moving towards illiquid wallets. Over 0.27% of the supply, about 51,000 BTC, was moved from a <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/key-analytics-to-provide-liquidity-in-defi/"">liquid to an illiquid state, according to Glassnode.“This week, we have seen net outflows of a reasonably high magnitude, with rates between 45,000 and 59,000 BTC per month. This has confluence with the increase in illiquid supply, indicating that some portion of the exchange withdrawn coins may have moved to colder storage.”As a result of how funds are moving, the total reserves held on exchanges have decreased to multi-year lows, reaching 13.27% of the circulating supply. This is very different from how funds moved during the May-July 2021 drawdown when over 164,000 BTC, or 0.84% of the circulating supply, was flowing into exchanges, alongside a decline in Illiquid supply equal to 1.5% of the circulating supply.“Despite equivalent scale drawdowns, the trends in exchange reserves and coin liquidity are trending in opposite directions. The current environment has a markedly more bullish undertone of supply absorption, and far fewer coins being spent and sold in fear,” the newsletter reads.Adding to the above bullish signs, during both of the May-July and the current drawdowns, settlement volumes declined significantly from the foregoing peaks. However, the floor value has continued to grow, even during bearish trends. This speaks to a more sustained, and even growing utility of Bitcoin.Also, these settlement volumes move away from retail-sized transactions (less than $100,000), towards high-net-worth and institutional-sized values (over $1 million).“Transactions over $10 million in size now dominate 45% of settled volume, whilst sizes over $1 million dominate over 70% on an entity-adjusted basis. Large size transactions have sustained this elevated dominance throughout 2021, and have actually peaked higher over the course of this correction.”Previous instances where settlement volumes have been this high relative to the market cap have preceded strong bullish impulses in bear markets, or at macro market bottoms such as December 2018, and March 2020.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 28, 2022  7:00 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCA seemingly daring choice given choppy markets, Christophe De Beukelaer, Brussels deputy cdH, decided to convert all of his deputy salary into Bitcoin.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brussels MP Christophe De Beukelaer will convert his salary into Bitcoin, and this, throughout the whole of 2022.

At its all-time high in November, BTC was trading at $59,000 and is at the time of writing down to around $36,500.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">De Beukelaer, however, doesn’t seem to be deterred by choppy markets. “We are at the dawn of a revolution of the same order as what we experienced with the Internet 30 years ago”, declared Christophe De Beukelaer in a press release. “A revolution that will disrupt all sectors, starting with finance, insurance and governance.”<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to De Beukelaer, it is the role of politicians to make the population aware of these societal changes that are coming. “We can no longer remain ignorant of this new world! It’s a bit like hanging on to the carriage or the candle as the cars and light bulbs appear.”<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By converting his MP salary into <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">bitcoin<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Christophe De Beukelaer wishes to open his eyes to at least three objectives – to demonstrate his confidence in this new technology that is being born.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I want to show that you can already now intelligently invest part of your money in a new store of value to balance your financial life.”<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Belgian MP would also like to call on economic and political actors to take an interest in blockchain technology. According to him, American and Asian finance are investing massively and Europe is lagging behind.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Are we going to wake up in ten years to find that we missed the train? It is therefore urgent that political and economic decision-makers take a serious interest in this new technology.  As power and counter-power are needed in politics, the same is true in the monetary field.”<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Christophe De Beukelaer’s final motivation for his move is to provoke deep reflection on the monetary system.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“All economists warn us that we are entering a very risky period: loss of confidence, inflation, the printing of banknotes like never before, <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/ecbs-christine-lagarde-is-prepared-for-digital-euro-as-crypto-interest-rises/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">digital euro<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">… However, these subjects are never addressed in the democratic debate. What is currency? What’s the point? What role for a Central Bank? I want to bring these topics to the public square in 2022,” the MP says.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nevertheless, Christophe De Beukelaer warns citizens about this form of investment. “As with any financial investment, you have to make your choices with great care. Personally, I can afford to make this decision because I am privileged and have been able to save money. Let’s be clear, I do not advise anyone to pay their entire salary in Bitcoin.”Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

El Salvador’s state-developed <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/almost-twice-as-many-salvadorians-have-a-bitcoin-wallet-than-a-bank-account/"">Chivo wallet has a proprietary Lightning Network node and uses the high-speed payment network to facilitate low-cost and near-instant transactions.<p class=""p1"">And while we’re yet to see if El Salvador’s Chivo wallet will stand the test of time, it acted as a significant booster to the usage level of the Lightning Network.<p class=""p1"">Lightning’s usage was further boosted by two other major integrations.<p class=""p1"">In September last year, Twitter <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/strikes-jack-mallers-explains-why-the-bitcoin-btc-twitter-deal-is-bigger-than-you-think/"">expanded its tipping feature to include Bitcoin. Available to users in El Salvador and the U.S., the feature enables users to send and receive Bitcoin essentially for free. For this, Twitter integrated with Strike, a payments application built on the Lightnin Network, which offers instant and free Bitcoin payments globally.<p class=""p1"">Online publishing platform Substack enabled a similar feature in late summer, partnering with OpenNode to enable its 500,000 paying customers to purchase subscriptions using Bitcoin.Last week, Mobile payments provider Cash App has also <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/cash-app-is-bringing-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-to-its-36-million-users/"">announced that it will introduce Lightning to its 36 million customers in the U.S. and the U.K.All of this has led to the Lightning Network experiencing unprecedented growth. According to data from CoinShares, Lightning has seen its network capacity, node count, channel count, and average channel size all increase significantly throughout the past year.In its latest Digital Asset Outlook report, CoinShares said that it expects Lightning to continue its growth in 2022. The company also believes that Lightning will begin experimenting with new use cases and move beyond just being a high-speed payment network for Bitcoin.However, while the growth the network experienced was significant relative to its past performance, it still remains a niche product in the crypto market.CoinShares noted that despite being around for four years, it still caters to a relatively small part of the market, consisting mostly of hobbyists and entrepreneurs. The underbanked and politically dissident also represent a significant portion of its user base, but a small part of the overall market.Lightning’s lack of popularity in the mainstream crypto market could also be caused by Bitcoin itself. The majority of the market still sees Bitcoin as a long-term investment and a hedge against inflation, choosing to hold the asset instead of using it for payments.The emergence of low-cost Layer-2 EVMs has also made Bitcoin much less attractive as a means of payment, drastically reducing the part of the market Lightning is trying to service.Nonetheless, Lightning’s slow and organic growth could be positive. The dramatic growth many DeFi and payment protocols experienced in the past few years ended in equally dramatic crashes. If Lightning keeps going at its slow and steady development pace, it has the potential to remain an integral part of the crypto market for years to come.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 28, 2022  5:00 am","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCDecentralized finance applications built on Ethereum are already flipping traditional financial service providers.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlateA new report by ARK Invest has predicted that <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/"">Ethereum’s market cap in the next eight years could rise to over $20 trillion while that of the entire crypto market could be worth as much as $50 trillion judging by its current growth in utility and efficiency.According to the <a href=""http://report/"">report, Ethereum’s growth in the last two years can be tied to the developments and adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) by the public.DeFi promises more interoperability, transparency, and financial services while minimizing intermediary fees and counterparty risk. After a turbulent 2018-2019, Ethereum emerged in 2021 as the predominant smart contracting platform for decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).ARK noted that Ethereum and its applications could be able to flip the services being provided by traditional financial institutions and that the native token of the blockchain could also be able to compete as a global currency by then. Already, the report highlighted the fact that ETH DApps are “usurping traditional financial functions at the margin.”If Ethereum’s market cap were to rise to $20 trillion by 2030, it means that the value of each asset would increase to over $170,000 per unit.As of press time, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap is trading for less than $2500 after the crypto market alongside the broader traditional market crashed at the beginning of the year.On <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"">Bitcoin, ARK Investment predicted that the value of the flagship digital asset would rise in tandem with the increased adoption the coin would see among countries in the world.This would lead to the value of BTC rising to over $1 million while its market cap would be inches away from $30 trillion.In addition, ARK expects Bitcoin to account for half of the global remittances made in 2030. It also predicts the asset to play a more prominent role in emerging markets and transaction settlements in the United States.Another of its predictions was that institutional investors would embrace Bitcoin investments in droves by then and that it would have eaten deep into gold’s total market cap. Cumulatively, all of this would help increase its value and importance generally.While Bitcoin mining is a generally <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/kazakhstan-is-cutting-off-power-supplies-to-crypto-miners/"">contentious issue due to the level of energy consumed by the space, ARK says Bitcoin mining was going to incentivize new and more efficient forms of energy generation.Conclusively, ARK’s research stated that Bitcoin mining has evolved into a multibillion-dollar industry because it can convert energy into “a monetary asset (that) can be critical in times of geopolitical uncertainty and financial market volatility.”Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 28, 2022  2:00 am","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThe fact that Bitcoin is beginning to behave like real assets is a positive development.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<p class=""p1""><a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"">Bitcoin has so far been very sensitive to any decisions coming from the Federal Reserve, experiencing massive sell-offs in an aggressive reaction to inflation.<p class=""p1"">This has prompted many to worry about how Bitcoin will perform in a rate-rising environment, given the fact that the Federal Reserve is considering 4 interest rate hikes in 2022.<p class=""p1"">While Bitcoin’s performance in the past two months doesn’t look too promising, a recent report showed that its recent sensitivity to inflation is actually an extremely bullish sign.<p class=""p1"">What will happen to Bitcoin in a market with increasing interest rates?<p class=""p1"">This is the question the latest CoinShares <a href=""https://coinshares.com/research/2022outlook"">Digital Asset Outlook report tries to answer.<p class=""p1"">After almost a decade of <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/why-bitcoin-federal-reserve-to-print-billions-to-keep-economy-afloat/"">unprecedented levels of quantitative easing (QE), the market is beginning to come to terms with the possibility of inflation hitting the U.S. market. This has worried the Federal Reserve as well, forcing it to consider enting the tapering of QE earlier than the market expected.<p class=""p1"">To curb the inflation they believe will inevitably come, the Federal Reserve is considering 4 interest rate hikes this year, rather than the 2 it originally proposed in 2021.<p class=""p1"">The last time the Federal Reserve increased interest rates was in 2015, Bitcoin rose by over 51% over a period of six months. With borrowing becoming increasingly more expensive, more people flocked to Bitcoin seeing it as a hedge against unstable markets.<p class=""p1"">However, CoinShares analysts believe that this time around Bitcoin won’t repeat this pattern.<p class=""p1"">“We believe Bitcoin has matured significantly since then and is therefore likely to behave differently, and likely in line with other real (inflationary) assets,” the report said.<p class=""p1"">Therefore, to understand how Bitcoin will act we need to look back at how other inflationary assets behaved in previous rate hiking periods.<p class=""p1"">CoinShares identified five periods that are closest to today—they all saw hikes that followed periods of falling or relatively low-interest rates for a long period. During December 1976, December 1986, February 1993, and June 2004 gold and other industrial commodities all showed surprising consistency in performance.<p class=""p1"">Being of fixed supply and priced in U.S. dollars, Bitcoin will most likely behave in a similar way to gold and other inflationary assets.<p class=""p1"">In December 2021 and January this year, Bitcoin experienced a strong reaction to inflation and the increasing probability of more rate hikes, dropping more than 30% from its highs. This means that any upcoming interest rate hike will also cause its price to drop, with every subsequent hike causing a less intense downturn.<p class=""p1"">However, following a period of downward price swings, Bitcoin will most likely see a significant increase in price. This is in line with how most real assets behaved in similar interest rate cycles, as well as Bitcoin’s inverse relationship with the strength of the U.S. dollar.<p class=""p1"">Namely, following periods of interest rate hikes, the U.S. dollar has been experiencing periods of extreme volatility and has fallen, on average, by 7% within a year.<p class=""p1"">As there’s a high chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates too aggressively, CoinShares expects the U.S. dollar to experience a similar selloff this year.<p class=""p1"">With the dollar losing its power, a big part of the market will flock to alternative assets, with Bitcoin being the clear choice among all cryptocurrencies. Its resistance to censorship and ability to get away from the long arm of the Federal Reserve make it an attractive hedge against inflation. If this was to happen, CoinShares believes that other real assets such as gold will follow suit and see periods of unbridled growth despite raising inflation and the dollar’s downturn.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 26, 2022  10:00 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThe recent sell off was largely driven by sentiments over U.S. Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening and projections of increased interest rates, however crypto fundamentals are stronger than ever.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate2022 crypto markets didn’t get off to a positive start as asset prices have fallen sharply since the new year, a decline that already began in November last year. Since all-time-highs, bitcoin (<a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"">BTC) and ether (<a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/"">ETH), the leading cryptocurrencies by market cap, are down 45 and 48.2 percent respectively. Over the past 30 days, the wider market lost $757 billion in total market cap.In a fresh <a href=""https://bitwiseinvestments.com/crypto-market-insights/notes-on-the-recent-market-pullback/"">report out of American crypto asset managers Bitwise, authored by Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan and Director of Research David Lawant, the authors point to market sentiment as the driving force behind the downturn. According to the report, “weak sentiment is driving the market lower, even as fundamentals remain strong.” Over the last week, the Bitwise 10 Index has dropped over 20 percent.“The market is likely to continue experiencing short-term volatility as it works through macro challenges, but our experience from past crypto pullbacks (along with the space’s strong fundamentals) leaves us optimistic about the long-term outlook,” the report reads.Over the past three months, the most important driver of the crypto market drawdown has been a broad shift in capital market sentiment from risk-on assets, typically tech stocks and crypto, to a risk-off sentiment driving investors towards protecting investments and favoring risk-off assets such as sovereign bonds. “This movement is being driven by an emerging consensus that the Federal Reserve will soon begin tightening monetary policy in an effort to battle inflation.”The result of this shift in sentiment is clear: the Nasdaq Composite Index is down more than 10 percent from its November 2021 peak, and many tech stocks are down 20 percent or more.“The recent sell-off is reminiscent of Q4 2018, the last time the market got uncomfortable with a more hawkish Fed. Then as now, the Fed’s stance sent risk assets tumbling across the board: The Nasdaq Composite fell 18 percent during the quarter, and the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 had their worst December since the Great Depression. Bitcoin dropped 44 percent in that same quarter,” the report continues.Though weak sentiments is the most likely force driving the recent pullback, the fundamentals of crypto are robust.According to the report, last year strengthened crypto’s fundamentals more than any year before:In the immediate future, markets will closely follow both eventual changes in Fed’s policies, however unlikely in the short term, and the February release of the Biden administration’s <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/us-federal-reserve-would-soon-release-detailed-plans-for-a-digital-dollar/"">executive order on crypto.Bitwise’s report concludes that the market “currently expects a fairly bearish directive, with a large focus on systemic risks, investor challenges, and issues around criminal activity.”“Any sign that these concerns are balanced by the positive impacts that crypto can provide—whether technological innovation, economic competitiveness, or more efficient access to capital—would be welcomed by the market.”Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

The new data now shows that the space has been able to break the jinx and has now witnessed its first inflow for the year.Total assets under management (AuM) are now $51bn, the lowest since early August 2021, having fallen 41% from the$86bn November 2021 peak.A cursory look at how investors invested their funds will show that they are currently not investing in the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/"">Ethereum. Per the data, products based on the assets saw outflows totaling $16 million.This means that outflows for Ethereum over the last seven weeks are now worth $245 million which is 2% of the value of the Asset under Management (AuM).Interestingly, ETH rivals like <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/"">Cardano and <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/"">Solana enjoyed inflows of $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, during the completed week.

"Jan. 25, 2022  8:00 am","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCIf the rate of crypto adoption remains the same, we could see over 1 billion crypto users by December—60% of which would own Bitcoin.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<p class=""p1"">The rate of cryptocurrency adoption is growing at an exponential rate. As the market gets more mature, more and more users are jumping onto the crypto train and increasing the global rate of crypto ownership.<p class=""p1"">According to the latest report from Crypto.com, we are currently on track to reach 1 billion crypto users by the end of 2022.<p class=""p1"">The growing push towards cryptocurrencies has been steadily increasing in the past few years. And while the retail market has always been the one driving this adoption, this year we’ve seen massive institutional efforts as well.<p class=""p1"">El Salvador’s <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/what-is-the-practicality-of-el-salvador-adopting-a-national-digital-currency/"">groundbreaking Bitcoin law was a cherry on top of an entire year of companies and financial institutions jumping aboard the crypto train.<p class=""p1"">All of this has translated into a significant increase in the number of crypto users. According to data from Crypto.com, there were 295 million crypto users globally as of December 29th, 2021. And while this number is just an aggregate of all of the users (cross-checked for double addresses) across two dozen centralized exchanges, it’s still a fairly good representation of the market.<p class=""p1"">Last year, the number of crypto users has almost tripled, increasing from 106 million in January to 295 million in December. If we see the same rate of increase in 2022, we are on track to reach 1 billion users by the end of the year.<p class=""p1"">This rate of increase in the number of crypto users will have a significant effect on the market. As of 2022, around 176 million global crypto users, or just under 60%, own Bitcoin. Only around 23 million own Ethereum, but 23% of the entire user base own both Bitcoin and Ethereum.<p class=""p1"">We’ve seen the biggest month-on-month growth of crypto users in August last year when the number of users grew by 15.2% when compared to the previous month. This increase in the number of users was partly responsible for Bitcoin’s stellar performance in the following months, peaking in November when it reached its ATH of $69,000.<p class=""p1"">The 15.2% growth rate we’ve seen in August was hard to replicate in the following months—MoM growth rates in September and October 2021 were just 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively.<p class=""p1"">Despite this, <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"">Bitcoin continued to capture the largest part of the crypto market—both in terms of market capitalization and the number of users. In July 2021, just under 56% of all crypto users owned Bitcoin. This market share continued to grow until October when it reached 63%. Once Bitcoin touched its ATH and began its two-month-long drawdown,<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  its market share decreased to 60%.<p class=""p1"">When it comes to Bitcoin’s market capitalization, it too began to decrease at the beginning of November 2021, falling below 40% at the end of the year. If this downtrend was to continue in 2022, we could see its dominance drop to historical lows.<p class=""p1"">However, none of that will affect the number of people owning Bitcoin. If the rate of ownership among crypto users was to remain around its current 60% level, it would mean that 600 million people would own Bitcoin.<p class=""p1"">Breaking down this data even further reveals an interesting phenomenon. In the second half of 2021, the number of Bitcoin users grew by 37.5%, increasing from 128 million in July to 176 million in December. <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/"">Ethereum, on the other hand, saw the number of its users increase by only 1.4% during this period.<p class=""p1"">This means that the number of Ethereum users remained steady at around 23 million throughout the second half of the year. However, in the first half of 2021, the number of Ethereum users grew by 64%. Ethereum also spent the entirety of 2021 losing its market share, which decreased from 13% in January to 8% in December 2021.<p class=""p1"">Crypto.com noted in its report that this might be due to the fact that various EVM-compatible blockchains and Layer-2 solutions drew away users and assets from Ethereum.<p class=""p1"">However, there could be another explanation for the lack of Ethereum adoption identified in the report.<p class=""p1"">As Crypto.com’s research methodology only considered centralized exchanges, it could have overlooked the vast DeFi market and potentially tens of millions of DEX users. In addition to that, Bitcoin has long received more mainstream press than Ethereum has, which could have made it more attractive to those completely new to the crypto industry.<p class=""p1"">There is also the issue of cost that could have driven more people to Bitcoin. Ethereum has been struggling with extremely high gas costs this past year, driving transaction fees through the roof. With the cost of a swap on a decentralized exchange often reaching hundreds of dollars, gas prices might have put Ethereum out of reach for many small-time retail investors new to crypto.<p class=""p1"">The complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem could have also been a significant factor in its lack of adoption. Out of the entire market, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that looks and behaves in a way similar to traditional financial assets. This makes it a good gateway to the world of cryptocurrencies for many new users.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 25, 2022  1:00 am","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCBitcoin continues falling highlighting the dangers of taking a salary in $BTC.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/whats-behind-the-rise-in-employers-offering-crypto-salaries/"">Odell Beckham Jr. is praised by many as instrumental in driving forward the Bitcoin as salary narrative.Last November, the L.A Rams wide receiver said he would take his salary in Bitcoin as part of a deal with payment provider Cash App.However, following Bitcoin’s dismal recent performance, financial research firm <a href=""https://twitter.com/Hedgeye/status/1485328439901052930"">Hedgeye points out that, in doing so, Beckham Jr. may have slipped up.Bitcoin continues to tumble on Monday as investors remain spooked by the Fed’s new hawkish stance on monetary policy.Recently, the U.S central bank signaled its intent to get tough with inflation by raising interest rates and cutting its balance sheet. Some analysts say a rate rise (of significance) would crash the market, while others say the Fed has no other choice.Fed officials will meet this week with spiraling consumer prices expected to be the front and center topic of discussion. The <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/c5f0e71f-e153-47ac-acc8-c31c2fa2a9b0"">FT anticipates the Fed will follow through by confirming a rate rise in March.Since the turn of the year, total crypto outflows have come in at $694.3 billion. Devasting losses over the last week see Curve topping the list with -54% losses, followed by Wonderland and Near.Bitcoin is faring relatively better with -23% losses in the last seven days. And, as the “crypto God market,” all eyes are on what Bitcoin will do next.By email, the Head of Market Insights at Genesis, Noelle Acheson, wrote that the Bitcoin <a href=""https://academy.glassnode.com/indicators/sopr/sopr-spent-output-profit-ratio"">Spent Output Profit Ratio, which measures profitability/losses, has been negative for most of this month.Acheson concluded that hit-and-run investors are exiting, at a loss, to preserve capital.“Bitcoin’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) – which compares sale price to acquisition price – has been in negative territory for almost all of January, indicating that investors are on average selling at a loss. This implies a degree of “capitulation” and hints at the exit from the market of those without long-term conviction.”Nonetheless, Acheson noted that long-term holders remain strong, as the number of $BTC not moved in a year climbs to 59% of supply.The fallout from recent price action highlights the pitfalls of taking a salary in Bitcoin.<a href=""https://twitter.com/Hedgeye/status/1485328439901052930"">Hedgeye stated that Beckham Jr.’s $750,000 salary was announced when $BTC was $64,293. But, following the downturn, $BTC is now valued at $35,400 (at the time of the tweet). This means his dollar salary comes in at $412,953.If that wasn’t painful enough, Hedgeye states Odell Jr.’s salary will be taxed at $750,000. Meaning, since November, Odell Jr. has netted just $35,703 for his appearances.<a href=""https://twitter.com/Hedgeye/status/1485330617114009603"">Hedgeye took the opportunity to slam being paid in Bitcoin, specifically calling out the Miami Mayor’s talk of paying public employees in $BTC.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 24, 2022  4:00 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThe bitcoin price hasn't been this low since July 2021. Bitcoin is down 50 percent from the November all-time-high, making this the second deepest drawdown in this halving cycle.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlateThis year has been nothing short of a blood bath for bitcoin. The market has not seen a bitcoin (<a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"">BTC) price this low since July last year. Corrections in 2017, and early 2021 were much shallower – between 20 and 40 percent, whilst July 2021 reached a drawdown of about 54 percent, according to fresh <a href=""https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=market.PriceDrawdownRelative&amp;resolution=24h&amp;s=1485297421&amp;u=1642977421&amp;zoom=1825"">data out of Glassnode.According to market analysts, there are two main reasons behind the latest draw-down, the most important being hawkish signals from the U.S. <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/the-feds-proposed-cbdc-a-dystopian-nightmare-or-a-necessary-evolution-of-the-dollar/"">Federal Reserve ushering in several increases to the U.S. interest rate. While the Fed warned of three possible rate hikes during 2022, a Goldman Sachs report predicted a faster pace of Fed tightening if inflation continues to rise. The inflation rate in the U.S. was at seven percent year-over-year in December, a rate not seen since the early 1980s.The second reason for bitcoin price drop, adding to bearish pressures around risk assets in general, seems to be the heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia around the situation in Ukraine.“We see a risk that the [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to take some tightening action at every meeting until the inflation picture changes,” Goldman economist David Mericle noted in Saturday’s client note, <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/23/inflation-surge-could-push-the-fed-into-more-than-four-rate-hikes-this-year-goldman-sachs-says.html"">according to CNBC.Goldman Sachs is expecting four rate hikes this year, each of them raising the interest by 0.25 percentage points, leaving the interest rate at 1.25 percent at the end of the year. However, so-called Fed fund futures are priced for nearly five rate increases. The first increased borrowing rate is coming in March, according to most commentators.Fed’s next policy meeting, due on Tuesday, will be an important indicator as to where the Fed is heading. The announcement from the meeting will be published on Wednesday at 19:00 UTC.According to the data site <a href=""https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData"">Coinglass, the latest series of <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-suffers-200-billion-drawdown-whats-happening/"">drawdowns have had a severe effect on investors and traders. Due to margin calls, more than $1.5 billion of bitcoin trading positions were liquidated over the past three days.The hawkish signals from the Fed are stirring fear among crypto traders that the Fed will compensate over the coming year for the lax monetary policy that has been prevalent over the past two years of the Covid pandemic. It is widely understood that the increase in bitcoin’s price over the two years of the pandemic comes in large from the Fed’s stimulus packages, including trillions of dollars of <a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20220120/"">money printing.“One of the bullish drivers for crypto over the last two years has been the surplus of pandemic-related fiscal and monetary stimulus globally, and much of that is coming to an end,” David Duong, head of institutional research at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wrote in a <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6890707430309728256/"">report on Sunday.The reason why Fed’s change in policy is bearish for cryptocurrencies is that while interest rates are low and inflation is high, investors tend to move further out the risk curve to seek yields. If the Fed is tightening its policy in order to lower inflation by raising the interest rate, investors tend to go in the opposite direction, de-risking risk-on assets such as equities and crypto, and investing in sovereign bonds that are now yielding better due to increased interest rates.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 21, 2022  11:00 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCAs a programmatic consequence of the Bitcoin network hitting a new all-time-high in total hash rate in the beginning of this year, the Bitcoin mining difficulty was adjusted to a new all-time-high today.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After Bitcoin total hash rate hitting a new all-time-high on December 3rd, the protocol has automatically adjusted the mining difficulty as shown by the latest <a href=""https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;chartStyle=column&amp;m=mining.DifficultyLatest""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">data<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> from analytics service Glassnode.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The <a href=""https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">hash rate<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of the Bitcoin network hit an all-time-low on the 3rd of July last year, clocking in at 84.8 million terahashes per second, down from just above 180 million terahashes per second on the 14th of May – almost a 50 percent drop in less than two months. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sudden drop in hash rate was due to the Chinese government crackdown on Bitcoin mining during the spring of 2021, and the consequent shutdown and migration of mining operations in and out of mainland China.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since then the network’s hash power has <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-hashrate-recovers-reaches-new-ath/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">recovered<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, due both to the migrants out of <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/why-chinas-crackdown-on-mining-is-actually-good-for-bitcoin/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">China<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> finding new pastures in mostly the U.S. and Kazakhstan, and new mining equipment spun up in the network. The hash power is currently clocking in at almost 199 million terahashes per second at the moment of writing.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By the Bitcoin protocol design, the so-called mining difficulty adjusts to the fluctuations in hash rate every 2016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks. As a consequence of the hash rate at new heights, the mining <a href=""https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">difficulty<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> increased by 9.32 percent and is now at 26.64 trillion. The upwards adjustment of the mining difficulty will cause mining operations to be less profitable than before. On the other hand, miners outside of China have seen haydays most of the year thanks to less competition from Chinese miners.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The balance between hash rate and mining difficulty is automatically set by the <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-sits-at-the-last-level-of-crucial-price-support/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bitcoin<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> protocol such that the network should produce a new block approximately every ten minutes. Miners compete to find a random number, a so-called nonce, by randomly trying different numbers. That random number is one of the inputs to a hashing algorithm that produces a hash. The more leading zeros there are in the hash, the easier it is to find the ransom number.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the new mining rigs are added to the network by the day, the hash power of the Bitcoin network is on the rise. This will, in turn, adjust the mining difficulty further upwards. With all likelihood, if nothing unexpected happens in the mining industry, the market can expect an increase in about two weeks.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

"Jan. 20, 2022  1:30 pm","Welcome Bonus: Get up to $100 in BTCThe market price of bitcoin faces crucial support at the current level as whales accumulate, but also strong resistance ahead.Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Trading activity on Wednesday indicates that Bitcoin bulls are fighting hard to keep the market price of bitcoin (BTC) above the crucial support level at around $42,000. According to data from <a href=""https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1483814069022908421"">IntoTheBlock, the IOMAP (In/Out of the Money Around Price) reveals that bitcoin currently sits at the last level of crucial support.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many <strong><a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/"">Bitcoin</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> addresses are still in the green between $41,180 and $42,470, meaning they bought at this level and are probably reluctant to sell at a lower price. In this range, more than 1.22 million addresses previously acquired 615,000 BTC. As evidenced by the level of trading activity, bulls are fighting to hold here.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bitcoin has rebounded and has regained around $1,000 in the past day or so. This comes after <a href=""https://cryptoslate.com/third-largest-bitcoin-whale-purchases-btc-worth-37-5-million/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>whales</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have accumulated 40,000 more BTC in the past three days alone. Whales are now back to owning the same amount of BTC as from before their dump began at $49,000.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the price of bitcoin rebounds from around $42,500, it will bump into stiff resistance on its path above $48,000. At the level around $43,700, almost one million addresses are holding 316,000 BTC. These are addresses that might want to break even on their positions if the price of the premier cryptocurrency reaches that level.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After and above the mid $43,000 level, and to surpass $48,000, BTC must go through 5.7 million addresses holding 1.54 million BTC. Upside appears to be limited toward the $43,000 to $45,000 resistance level, and $48,000 could present another resistance for bulls given the series of lower price highs since November.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Zooming out, the top cryptocurrency by market cap is down around 4.1 percent the past seven days, and down 38.9 percent since all-time-high at $69,044 on the 10th of November last year. At the time of writing on Thursday, bitcoin is changing hands at $42,141.Featuring a summary of the most important daily stories in the world of crypto, DeFi, NFTs and more.Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices have suffered weakness lately, dropping sharply yesterday. Bitcoin prices fell to less than $40,00 today, consistently fluctuating south of that level and reaching their lowest in roughly two weeks. The world’s most prominent digital currency dropped below $40,000 around 9:30 a.m. EST, before declining to as little as $39,477.09 around 11 a.m. EST, <a aria-label=CoinDesk figures class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk figures</a> show. This latest downward movement took place after the cryptocurrency fell sharply yesterday, <a aria-label=suffering class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/17/bitcoin-suffers-biggest-drop-in-four-weeks-nearing-40k/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/17/bitcoin-suffers-biggest-drop-in-four-weeks-nearing-40k/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/17/bitcoin-suffers-biggest-drop-in-four-weeks-nearing-40k/>suffering</a> its largest intraday loss since January 21. After depreciating to its recent low of $39,477.09, bitcoin bounced back, surpassing $40,400 in less than an hour, but once again moved lower, repeatedly reaching points below $40,000. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] <strong>Global Political Uncertainty</strong>When describing bitcoin’s recent price weakness, several experts highlighted how political uncertainty affected the markets. Ben McMillan, CIO at <a aria-label=IDX Digital Assets class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://idxdigitalassets.com/ href=https://idxdigitalassets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://idxdigitalassets.com/>IDX Digital Assets</a>, spoke to these developments, describing yesterday’s downward price movement as “largely a technical sell-off on the back of continued uncertainty about Ukraine as well as the President's executive order on crypto regulation.” Ben Armstrong, founder of <a aria-label=BitBoy Crypto class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitboycrypto.com/ href=https://bitboycrypto.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitboycrypto.com/>BitBoy Crypto</a>, also weighed in, stating that “the instability around the Ukrainian-Russian border has led to a drop in the Bitcoin price.” “This could be a sign of fundamental stress on the price of Bitcoin as opposed to a purely technical move,” he added.<strong>Key Technical Levels</strong>In addition to shedding light on what caused bitcoin’s recent price movements, several experts provided technical analysis, outlining key levels of support and resistance that bitcoin might encounter. Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider <a aria-label=Trade The Chain class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.tradethechain.com/ href=https://www.tradethechain.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.tradethechain.com/>Trade The Chain</a>, spoke to this matter. “Bitcoin technical analysis shows key liquidity levels at $38,700 and $37,000, meaning there is a lot of buy interest at those levels. If Bitcoin is unable to hold $40,000, it is likely to test those levels into the weekend.” Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for <a aria-label=Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://gerberkawasaki.com/ href=https://gerberkawasaki.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://gerberkawasaki.com/>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management</a>, also contributed input.“I think there are two major levels to watch out for on the downside. The first level is the low from this current correction, which bottomed on January 24th just under $33,000,” he stated. “Another major level would be around $30,000, which has served as a major support level since early 2021. A break of this ~$30,000 support level could suggest another major downturn.” Sifling also spoke to resistance levels, noting that “For bulls to regain control, we’d like to see a base build at or above the $50,000 level before making a move towards $60,000 and then all time highs.” McMillan commented on some potential resistance, stating that “Bitcoin is trading between the key levels of $40k and $45k and a breakout on either side would likely be followed by a sustained move in that direction.” William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform <a aria-label=Token Metrics class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://tokenmetrics.com/ href=https://tokenmetrics.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://tokenmetrics.com/>Token Metrics</a>, spoke to the head and shoulders pattern, a kind of chart formation that frequently points to a trend reversal. “There is a very clear head and shoulders top on the bitcoin daily chart. The pattern was confirmed by the failed rally to 45k and subsequent decline,” he stated. “The next big levels are 36,700 and 34,000. 36,700 was the takeoff point of the most recent up move that stopped near 45k.”Noble also mentioned further price levels that could provide key support. “34k is an interesting point as well. Back in July 2021, 34k was the high the week of the final big down week of that correction,” he stated. “BTC may bounce in a big way off that level. Using Fibonacci extension work, it is possible bitcoin falls to 28k, especially if the stock market bubble pops.” <strong>Bitcoin’s Short-Term Outlook</strong>Tim Enneking, managing director of <a aria-label=Digital Capital Management class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.digital-capital-management.com/ href=https://www.digital-capital-management.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.digital-capital-management.com/>Digital Capital Management</a>, spoke to the key variables affecting bitcoin’s price, as well as what they could mean for the digital currency’s outlook in the near future. “While $40k is an important level psychologically, there is really nothing magic about it,” he noted. “Even though the news has been generally good in the crypto space recently, the truly annoying high recent correlation with the SPX, coupled with geopolitical concerns focused around the pending (and seemingly inevitable) Russian invasion of Ukraine, is putting pressure on BTC for really no fundamental reason,” said Enneking. “That pressure hurts three primary theses of BTC: (1) safe haven, (2) non-correlated, and (3) inflation hedge.” “The crypto optimist in me says that, once the invasion of Ukraine takes place, the price will drop (with fiat equity markets), but then recover more quickly and much harder than fiat markets. That remains to be seen, however.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Feb 18 2022 12:22pm,"The price of bitcoin tumbled below $40,000 for the first time in two weeks on Friday as the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to drive a broad market selloff, leading some analysts to say the crypto market's recent weakness won't subside until the tensions are resolved and could even worsen amid looming inflation.The price of bitcoin tumbled below $40,000 for the first time in two weeks on Friday.The world's most valuable cryptocurrency fell as much as 5% Friday morning to about $39,791 by 11 a.m. ET, its lowest price since February 4, as other top tokens also plummeted, with ether and sol down about 6% apiece.In a Friday morning email, analyst Marcus Sotiriou of cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock attributed the losses to increased tension in Europe on Thursday, when President Joe Biden <a aria-label=told reporters class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/02/17/biden-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-could-come-in-next-several-days/?sh=4635bf8d49e9 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/02/17/biden-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-could-come-in-next-several-days/?sh=4635bf8d49e9 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/02/17/biden-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-could-come-in-next-several-days/?sh=4635bf8d49e9>told reporters</a> that “every indication” points to Russia invading Ukraine in the “next several days”—triggering a selloff that <a aria-label=wiped class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/17/stock-market-losses-grow-as-russia-ukraine-tensions-reach-a-crucial-moment/?sh=662b004b4c9b href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/17/stock-market-losses-grow-as-russia-ukraine-tensions-reach-a-crucial-moment/?sh=662b004b4c9b target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/17/stock-market-losses-grow-as-russia-ukraine-tensions-reach-a-crucial-moment/?sh=662b004b4c9b>wiped</a> about 2% from major stock-market indexes.Crypto analyst Yuya Hasegawa of Japanese exchange Bitbank was slightly optimistic about the short term, saying bitcoin has held above $39,650 long enough to suggest resilience barring any escalating conflict, but he cautioned the make or break situation at the border was only one of several events sure to test bitcoin's price in the coming weeks.Chief among concerns, Hasegawa pointed to the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 50 basis points next month (more than the 25-basis-point hike <a aria-label=widely expected class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/02/11/feds-wake-up-call-investors-losing-confidence-after-latest-inflation-surge-how-aggressive-could-rate-hikes-be/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/02/11/feds-wake-up-call-investors-losing-confidence-after-latest-inflation-surge-how-aggressive-could-rate-hikes-be/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/02/11/feds-wake-up-call-investors-losing-confidence-after-latest-inflation-surge-how-aggressive-could-rate-hikes-be/>widely expected</a>), which may be likely after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard <a aria-label=cautioned class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/17/feds-bullard-says-inflation-could-get-out-of-control-so-action-is-needed-now.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/17/feds-bullard-says-inflation-could-get-out-of-control-so-action-is-needed-now.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/17/feds-bullard-says-inflation-could-get-out-of-control-so-action-is-needed-now.html>cautioned</a> last week that inflation could get out of control.As such, inflation data and the January jobs report in the weeks to come could also spur losses, Hasegawa said, particularly if the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports another higher-than-expected inflation figure, which could pressure officials to hike rates aggressively to help combat the surging prices.Eli Ndinga, a research lead at cryptocurrency issuer Amun, agreed in an email, saying the recent inflation reports have instilled fears that the U.S. economy could be headed towards a recession as the Fed reverses pandemic-era stimulus measures.It is safe to say that, depending especially on the inflation data, the worst may be ahead of us, and even if [bitcoin's] price rebounds… in the short term, its upside is likely quite limited unless the Russian military shows some signs of retreating, Hasegawa said. Growing institutional adoption and inflationary concerns helped lift cryptocurrencies to meteoric new highs during the pandemic, but the market has since soured. The rapid pace of inflation, which has been rising for months at the fastest rate since 1982, has prompted Fed officials to reverse their pandemic-era policy more quickly than economists expected. This puts risk asset classes such as crypto and tech stocks in a challenging spot, Ndinga said Friday. The value of the world's cryptocurrencies has plummeted more than 33% to $1.9 trillion since hitting an all-time high of $3 trillion in November, with about $180 billion of that wiped amid the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine this week.The Fed’s next two-day policy meeting concludes March 17, when officials are expected to announce if—and by how much—they'll raise interest rates.Despite the recent price weakness, traditional financial institutions are still expanding their exposure to cryptocurrency.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"As originally reported in the Toronto Star last Monday, February 7, Greg Foss, a Canadian and former hedge fund manager, was identified as one of five ‘multi-signature’ key holders of the Bitcoin raised for the ‘Freedom convoy’ trucker protests in Canada. When GoFundMe froze the funds from a “Freedom Convoy 2022” page - with donations totaling $7.9 million dollars - an opportunity presented itself to demonstrate how the censorship-resistance feature that bitcoin might work in real life.Foss was reported as saying that same Monday night, “This is just gonna explode. And you know, this is what Bitcoin was made for...GoFundMe just proved the entire use case for Bitcoin. And we’re going to take advantage of it.” Fast-forward to this week, when Foss saw his country decide to invoke the ‘Emergency Measures’ Act that allowed law enforcement to freeze cryptocurrency transactions.During the interview with Foss, news broke that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were provided a list of <a aria-label=34 cryptocurrency wallets class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/canada-sanctions-34-crypto-wallets-tied-to-trucker-freedom-convoy/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/canada-sanctions-34-crypto-wallets-tied-to-trucker-freedom-convoy/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/canada-sanctions-34-crypto-wallets-tied-to-trucker-freedom-convoy/>34 cryptocurrency wallets</a> that have been sanctioned by the Government under the ‘Emergency Measures’ Act. When Foss received the breaking news about the RCMP, he shared with me that, “The Royal Canadian Mounted Police orders a blacklist of 34 digital wallets which can now be seized under the Executive Orders under this Emergencies Act. So those wallets can be seized, that’s interesting.” Regarding his prior involvement with the Bitcoin fundraising as a multi-signature holder before the Emergencies Act was passed, Foss declared, “In my opinion, I am not guilty of anything but trying to support a freedom movement. Was my name associated with a big fundraise? Yes it was, but at the time it was not illegal.” After the Emergencies Act became effective, Foss declared he quickly removed himself from any involvement as a multi-signature key holder for the Bitcoin that was raised. “Once it has been illegal, I decided I am not going to be associated with that fundraise. If someone wanted to send me Bitcoin on behalf of the Freedom Convoy, I would not accept it,” says Foss.Greg Foss, former Hedge Fund Manager, who played an initial role in helping secure Bitcoin that was <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> donated for the 'Freedom Convoy' protests in Canada. </span>Foss, who clearly had a lot of stress regarding the circumstances of his country, stated, “The Government has shown what they want to do. I am a law-abiding citizen. It doesn’t mean I agree with all the laws. But the law right now is ... they have identified any source of funding as an illegal activity.” After our interview, Foss did make one small confession - he was in fact a Montreal Canadiens fan which in much of Ontario, he stated he knew was ‘sacrilege’. Greg Foss, a Bitcoin influencer in Ottowa, Canada, admits to being an ice hockey fan of a team in <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Montreal, showing a sense of humor amid the pressures of the 'Freedom Convoy' Trucker demonstrations with the country invoking the 'Emergencies Act'. </span>Foss described what was happening in his country as, “...an eye-opening experience. This has proven the utility value of decentralized platforms like bitcoin.” It was like a breath of fresh air when Foss saw how a political leader in the U.S. take a policy stand with a new bill about the importance of self-custody and privacy rights in peer-to-peer crypto transactions. Enter Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) announced the introduction of the <a aria-label=Keep Your Coins Act class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.scribd.com/document/559119693/Bill-pdf href=https://www.scribd.com/document/559119693/Bill-pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.scribd.com/document/559119693/Bill-pdf>Keep Your Coins Act</a> on Twitter, hoping that his bill would help avoid the type of fund seizure in Canada from occurring in the United States. However, his legislation has a long way to go and will likely receive resistance both from the U.S. Treasury and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body that promotes policies around the world to countries as a way to combat money laundering and terrorism. According to a recent release of an agenda from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the self-hosted wallets is back on the agenda for the U.S. Treasury in 2022. Meanwhile, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF),, released <a aria-label=new guidance on cryptocurrencies class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf href=https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf>new guidance on cryptocurrencies</a> last October. With respect to recent guidance on unhosted wallets (self-hosted wallets) and P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions, FATF advises countries to, “...be aware of the risk posed by...transfers to/from unhosted wallets and related P2P transactions. Such transactions may be attractive to illicit actors due to anonymity, the lack of limits on portability, mobility, transaction speed, and usability.” FATF also advises cryptocurrency exchanges to, “...collect data on their unhosted wallet transfers, and monitor and assess that information as necessary to determine to what extent a transaction is within their risk appetite, and the appropriate risk-based controls to apply...”. Ultimately, the fight over self-custody of coins will likely be a major policy issue that will be discussed in the U.S., while the events in Canada has accelerated the position regarding the ability to sanction cryptocurrency. <em>Disclosure: I own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a former U.S. Regulator with the FDIC, compliance examiner for the Making Home Affordable Program (HAMP) with the Treasury, and have been active in bitcoin and blockchain since 2016.

The two are accused of laundering $4.4 billion worth of hacked Bitcoin.

The only time they addressed the court was in response to questions from the judge about their understanding of the potential conflicts of interest that could arise from them sharing an attorney. For his part, defense attorney Samson Enzer spent most of his efforts highlighting the numerous ties that the pair has to the US, indicating that they would not flee. That included pointing out that even though Lichtenstein was born in  Russia, his parents have “lived in the Chicago suburbs for decades.” Morgan’s parents continue to live in northern California, where she grew up.Both defendants’ parents looked glum as they entered the courtroom, carrying backpacks and plastic grocery bags, and declined to speak with reporters in the hallway of the courthouse.“They have made their lives here,” Enzer said, referring to the defendants, Lichtenstein and Morgan. “They would not want to abandon them.”Enzer also made reference to the fact that the young couple may not be able to have children unless Morgan has in-vitro fertilization and that her eggs are already frozen at a facility in New York. As such, the defense lawyer argued, this was another reason as to why the duo would stay in the United States and respond to the criminal charges.“They would literally be leaving their future behind,” he said.At one point, Enzer called the evidence specifically against Morgan “flimsy,” speculating that she could have been the unwilling recipient of the hacked bitcoins. Judge Howell pointed out that false statements Morgan allegedly made when opening financial accounts and speaking with an accountant make it likely she knew what she was doing.Judge Howell, who has presided over <a aria-label=an earlier case involving laundering cryptocurrency class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16830474/united-states-v-harmon/?page=2 href=https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16830474/united-states-v-harmon/?page=2 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16830474/united-states-v-harmon/?page=2>an earlier case involving laundering cryptocurrency</a>, seemed comfortable with the technical language used on Monday, referencing private keys, encryption, blockchain, and other related terms like they were part of her everyday vocabulary. Still, despite a spirited defense in court, Judge Howell was very skeptical of Enzer’s overall argument, even though she did ultimately grant Morgan’s release.“The blockchain leaves a clear path for those willing to follow it,” the judge said.For now, no further hearings have been scheduled.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I took an unusual route to get here.

While bitcoin's hashrate isn't directly correlated to its price, it has rocketed higher along with the bitcoin price over the last two years. A higher bitcoin hashrate indicates an increase in so-called bitcoin miners who use high-powered computers to secure the bitcoin network in return for freshly-minted bitcoins. Meanwhile, data has shown institutional investors may be feeling more upbeat about ethereum following weeks of uncertainty. Ethereum finally broke its 9-week spell of outflows with inflows totaling $21 million last week, CoinShares analysts wrote in their latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, with combined crypto funds seeing inflows of $75 million, adding to inflows over the last four weeks of $209 million.The inflows remain relatively minor in comparison to the inflows seen in Q4 2021, the report authors wrote.

Bitcoin is insurance against financial catastrophe as we see in Lebanon, or in Afghanistan, or many of these other countries where we saw (that) around the time of the pandemic.Last month, Lebanon's government laid out a plan to tackle the country's long-running financial crisis, projecting a 93% devaluation of the Lebanese pound, it was reported by <a aria-label=Reuters class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/lebanon-plan-sees-93-currency-slide-turns-bulk-fx-deposits-pounds-2022-01-31/ href=https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/lebanon-plan-sees-93-currency-slide-turns-bulk-fx-deposits-pounds-2022-01-31/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/lebanon-plan-sees-93-currency-slide-turns-bulk-fx-deposits-pounds-2022-01-31/><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/lebanon-plan-sees-93-currency-slide-turns-bulk-fx-deposits-pounds-2022-01-31/>Reuters</em></a>. Meanwhile, cash shortages have exacerbated a deepening economic crisis and soaring inflation in Afghanistan after the Taliban seized control and the former government collapsed last summer. Globally, inflation has surged as lockdowns put in place to curb the Covid-19 pandemic have come to an end and economies remain awash with pandemic-era stimulus cash. Insurance policies have no intrinsic value, said Miller. In fact, you want them to have no intrinsic value. You don't want to have your house burned down, or get in a terrible accident, but you pay for insurance every year in case that happens.Miller also clarified comments made in January that were taken to mean that he had invested half of his personal wealth into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He said he'd only a few percent of his net worth into bitcoin, which then grew to become half his total fortune as the price rose.

But geopolitical issues this week have tested its other core values of being a viable decentralized, tamper-proof, unconfiscatable monetary system. These real-life use cases will further increase bitcoin’s mass adoption and lead to higher prices this year.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Digital asset markets start the weekend with price declines.In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has dropped almost 5%, falling from $46,000 to less than $43,000, at the time of writing. The factor behind the sell0ff appears to be the heightened fear that Russia intends to invade Ukraine. Bitcoin has fallen almost 5% recentlyDespite the weakness, not all market segments have experienced losses, e.g. stable coins.

Mar 5 2022 06:26pm ,"View from Berkeley Hills, CaliforniaLocal governments have been interested in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum for years, and some have begun accepting it as a form of payment for certain transactions. But come places are taking it a step further.  Last month, Berkeley, Calif., <a aria-label=announced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.jessearreguin.com/press-releases/2021/12/23/berkeley-city-council-moves-to-enable-blockchain-microbond-financing-program href=https://www.jessearreguin.com/press-releases/2021/12/23/berkeley-city-council-moves-to-enable-blockchain-microbond-financing-program rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.jessearreguin.com/press-releases/2021/12/23/berkeley-city-council-moves-to-enable-blockchain-microbond-financing-program>announced</a> it was moving forward on a long anticipated project to sell “microbonds” in the municipal market. City leaders initially had the idea in 2018, and are working with UC Berkeley’s blockchain accelerator lab, <a aria-label=Blockchain at Berkeley class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/ href=https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/>Blockchain at Berkeley</a>. The project is the brainchild of Mayor Jesse Arreguín and Councilmember Ben Bartlett and would issue municipal bonds using the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrency. This would allow municipal microbonds to be issued in denominations as low as $5 or $10, as opposed to the minimum $5,000 bond denomination that’s common today.“In expanding access to community investments by way of microbonds, Berkeley will simultaneously crowdsource additional funding for public projects while providing more individuals with investment opportunities,” Arreguín said in a statement. Meanwhile, <a aria-label=CityCoins class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.citycoins.co/ href=https://www.citycoins.co/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.citycoins.co/>CityCoins</a> offers cities a different approach to raise revenue with digital currency. The nonprofit has a platform that allows its users to mine for new tokens and then select a participating city to support. A computer program allocates 30% of the mined cryptocurrency to that city, while users get the other 70%. In December, <a aria-label=Austin class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://statescoop.com/austin-texas-citycoins-cryptocurrency/ href=https://statescoop.com/austin-texas-citycoins-cryptocurrency/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://statescoop.com/austin-texas-citycoins-cryptocurrency/>Austin</a> became the latest city to strike a deal with the startup, joining Miami and <a aria-label=New York City class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.citycoins.co/post/nyccoin-mining-activates-on-november-10 href=https://www.citycoins.co/post/nyccoin-mining-activates-on-november-10 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.citycoins.co/post/nyccoin-mining-activates-on-november-10>New York City</a>. So far, <a aria-label=Miami class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/30/crypto-miamicoin/ href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/30/crypto-miamicoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/30/crypto-miamicoin/>Miami</a> has received more than $7 million in value. According to CityCoins, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco are also poised to have their own digital currencies.Last, Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve is working on a plan that would allow city residents to receive cryptocurrency that corresponds to the value of certain city-owned parcels. People could buy and sell their stakes, and if the land were leased or sold, they would all share in the proceeds. The idea is just one of many blockchain enthusiast Schieve has for marketing the “biggest little city” as more youthful and vibrant.These approaches have one big thing in common: they are rooted in grassroots fundraising, albeit with a 21st Century twist. Berkeley’s approach, for example, seeks to democratize the municipal market, <a aria-label=something that has long been talked about, class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-democratizing-municipal-market.html href=https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-democratizing-municipal-market.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-democratizing-municipal-market.html>something that has long been talked about,</a> but never really achieved. Big picture, the advent of microbonds and cryptocurrency in general gives regular folks (and ideally, residents) a chance to buy a stake in their city and potentially profit from it. As Schieve <a aria-label=put it to Wired class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.wired.com/story/mayor-reno-betting-blockchain/ href=https://www.wired.com/story/mayor-reno-betting-blockchain/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.wired.com/story/mayor-reno-betting-blockchain/>put it to Wired</a>, “Anything that could make your community better is worth trying.”<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a fiscal policy expert, national journalist and public speaker who has spent more than 15 years writing about the many ways state and local governments collect and spend taxpayer money.

JPMorgan's calculations are based on bitcoin's volatility in comparison with gold, with bitcoin roughly four times as volatile. However, if bitcoin's volatility differential narrows to just three times gold's, the bitcoin price fair value rises to $50,000. Over the longer term, JPMorgan has maintained its huge $150,000 bitcoin price prediction—a price that would give bitcoin a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion and put it on par with all gold held privately for investment purposes.With no fundamental value, like commodities, stocks or bonds have, bitcoin's price is influenced by investor interest, making it a purely speculative asset, Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, said in emailed comments. Simply put, its price is determined not so much by volatility as by crowd interest. Without investor interest, it quickly goes sour, and with it, it picks up just as fast. In bitcoin's favour is the reduced supply growth rate and its finiteness.By some measures, the bitcoin price is becoming less volatile over time, which could increase its appeal to institutional investors. We should also note that the entry of institutional investors, the increasing acceptance of bitcoin as an asset for portfolio diversification, and the increased trading turnover in cryptocurrencies make the price less volatile over time, Kuptsikevich added, pointing to the bitcoin price climbing around 18 times from bottom to peak during the 2020-2021 growth cycle, while after the previous halving, in 2016-2017, the price rose 52 times.

Feb 10 2022 06:10pm,"Heather Morgan and Ilya LichtensteinAs federal investigators raided the home of New York couple Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan last month, Morgan insisted that she be able to retrieve her cat from the bedroom. But as Morgan went through the motions of coaxing the animal from under the bed, agents saw that she was frantically trying to lock her phone, prompting them to wrestle her to the ground, prosecutors say. The last-ditch effort by Morgan, 31, and her husband Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, to conceal their alleged role in laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin, is among more details to emerge from prosecutors who argued in a <a aria-label=court filing class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202409-18-main href=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202409-18-main rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202409-18-main>court filing</a> Thursday that the two suspects should remain in custody.

On Thursday, Chief Judge Beryl Howell ordered that Lichtenstein and Morgan continue to be held in custody and that they be formally transferred from a federal facility in Brooklyn to Washington, DC, where their case will resume in a federal court there. The disclosure follows <a aria-label=Forbes reporting class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2022/02/09/heather-morgan-ilya-lichtenstein-bitcoin-seizure/?sh=4e2f5ec11ea2 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2022/02/09/heather-morgan-ilya-lichtenstein-bitcoin-seizure/?sh=4e2f5ec11ea2 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2022/02/09/heather-morgan-ilya-lichtenstein-bitcoin-seizure/?sh=4e2f5ec11ea2><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2022/02/09/heather-morgan-ilya-lichtenstein-bitcoin-seizure/?sh=4e2f5ec11ea2>Forbes</em> reporting</a> on the couple, who built an image as successful tech entrepreneurs, while allegedly laundering the stolen bitcoin. Lichtenstein had once launched a company and raised money from Mark Cuban, before investing in startups alongside tech leaders like Marc Benioff. Morgan, meanwhile, styled herself as a prolific thought leader, writing online posts as a contributor to Forbes.com about women in leadership, and even had an alter ego as a goofy YouTube rapper called Razzlekhan, who talked about success and money. Among the items found at the New York couple's home were hollowed out books used to conceal items.In the 34-page document released Thursday, new details paint a clearer picture of the defendants’ activities in the years preceding their arrest this week. Prosecutors outline how that the couple's 2019 activities in Ukraine “at times appear pulled from the pages of a spy novel.” The court document, made in preparation for a detention hearing set for Friday, also chronicles in brief what happened when their apartment in New York City was searched on January 5. Agents found $40,000 in cash, <a aria-label=dozens of electronic devices class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202409-18-main#document/p18/a2080571 href=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202409-18-main#document/p18/a2080571 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202409-18-main#document/p18/a2080571>dozens of electronic devices</a>, and even two hollowed-out books, among other items.On Wednesday, Samson Enzer, one of the attorneys representing Lichtenstein and Morgan wrote in a <a aria-label=letter class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21201893-15-main href=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21201893-15-main rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21201893-15-main>letter</a> to the judge arguing that his clients should be released as they are not a flight risk. Further, he wrote, there are “significant holes” in the government’s case, in particular as it pertains to Morgan, because was no wiretap, or “nothing else resembling direct proof of the charges.”The new Thursday letter, in response, says that, in fact, Morgan “played an integral role in the money laundering and fraud scheme.”Authorities further allege that on January 31, when law enforcement was able to decrypt several files held in Lichtenstein’s cloud storage account, not only did they find a spreadsheet of his various crypto accounts, but also “apparent wallet files for additional cryptocurrency that the government has not yet been able to seize.” Several of those files, “include variations of the word ‘dirty’ in their names, such as ‘dirty_wallet.dat.’”In August 2019, the couple traveled to Ukraine for a month. Prosecutors say that it was during this time that Lichtenstein “created and/or modified numerous files” in this account “that contained notes about money laundering and/or false identification documentation with Ukrainian connections.” It appears that during this period, they received packages from Russia to Ukraine, seemingly from darknet vendors selling fake passports.The “notes” file also lists “delivery info” as the 11 Mirrors Design Hotel in Kiev, which as prosecutors note, is the same hotel that Morgan posted photos of on her social media platforms, indicating that she was staying nearby. Additionally, the government says it has “an Uber receipt” showing that Morgan took a car from the Design Hotel on September 11, 2019.Federal agents seized $40,000 cash during the raid last month.<br/>Another document contained within Lichtenstein’s cloud storage account, prosecutors say, includes a Russian-language document that describes “how to anonymously receive a parcel in Ukraine.” That document provides details of video camera positioning in Ukrainian post offices and how to avoid being seen.Finally, the government has provided for the first time, new details about the day that their New York apartment was searched.When agents arrived and secured the apartment, Morgan and Lichtenstein said that they did not want to stick around, and asked to take their cat with them. The agents present allowed Morgan to get her cat, which was hiding under the bed.But, according to the court document, “while Morgan was crouched next to the bed calling to the cat, she positioned herself next to the nightstand, which was still holding one of her phones. She then reached up and grabbed her cell phone from the nightstand and repeatedly hit the lock button. It appeared that Morgan was attempting to lock the phone in a way that would make it more difficult for law enforcement to search the phone’s contents. Law enforcement had to wrest the phone from her hands.”All in all, the government says that in particular, Morgan was “extremely hands-on” in the scheme, and noted that her “business accounts were used to clean and legitimize funds stolen.”In a separate <a aria-label=filing class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202415-show_temp-5 href=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202415-show_temp-5 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21202415-show_temp-5>filing</a> submitted to the court on Thursday, Lichtenstein and Morgan’s lawyers say that they have not been able to “see, speak with or visit Mr. Lichtenstein” since he arrived at a federal facility in Brooklyn. “Because the [Bureau of Prisons] apparently misspelled his name in its intake systems, it was not until yesterday that we learned that Mr. Lichtenstein is being detained at MDC Brooklyn,” they wrote, describing a series of bureaucratic roadblocks that have further stymied their efforts. The lawyers have asked the judge to have a “legal visit (or at least a legal call)” with him on Thursday and another on Friday in advance of the upcoming bail review hearing. <p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I cover Silicon Valley — in particular surveillance technology and artificial intelligence — from beautiful Oakland, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get in touch: cfarivar@forbes.com or +1-341-758-0888 (Signal/WhatsApp)&lt;/p&gt;><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I'm a staff reporter at Forbes covering tech companies.

Rather, the reason Democrats and Republicans will embrace Bitcoin is because Bitcoin will create jobs – high-income jobs, particularly, in heartland and rural America. If you’re new to Bitcoin, it might not be clear why this is the case. Understanding what Bitcoin achieves, why it matters, and why it differs from other cryptocurrencies remains difficult, and for some like myself, it’s been <a aria-label=a career-long pursuit class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/pete-rizzo-bitcoin-journalist href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/pete-rizzo-bitcoin-journalist rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/pete-rizzo-bitcoin-journalist>a career-long pursuit</a>. Simply put, Bitcoin requires energy. A truly decentralized monetary system, Bitcoin allows anyone in the world the opportunity to provide the computation it needs to update its global ledger of transactions. A decade ago, this energy could be provided with a graphics card (like the one in your gaming computer) or on a laptop (like the one you might be reading this article on), and the Bitcoin you received wouldn’t have been worth much. In 2010, the 50 BTC you received for adding a block to the ledger might have netted you just $50 at most.But that’s no longer the case. As Bitcoin has become more popular, it has become more valuable. Today, those who mine Bitcoin blocks receive 6.25 BTC worth $250,000, a figure that’s incentivizing advances in the business of mining Bitcoin. This has encouraged America’s entrepreneurs to do what they have always done, take advantage of opportunity to build profitable businesses. Yet, it’s becoming clear the kind of businesses Bitcoin entrepreneurs are creating are novel within our economy. Just take a look at the following chart, which shows the distribution of new Bitcoin mining operations. It doesn’t take much to see this differs from the hiring profile of the average Silicon Valley unicorn or Wall Street upstart.US bitcoin mining power distribution by state. Bloomberg As the co-authors of a new book on Bitcoin policy, we’ve seen this transition firsthand, and we have to admit, it’s even surprised us to see the large number of public U.S. companies that are now mining Bitcoin and serving our energy grid.In the following article, excerpted from our book, <a aria-label=Bitcoin and the American Dream class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z href=https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z>Bitcoin and the American Dream</em></a><em>, </em>we detail how Bitcoin is making economical new forms of energy production, revitalizing American towns, and incentivizing the use of formerly wasted energy.<strong>Bitcoin Creates Jobs and Revitalizes Industry </strong>In gritty, proud, blue-collar communities across middle America, the decline of domestic manufacturing is a major concern.At the dawn of the 1980s, US manufacturing accounted <a aria-label=for one-fifth of all American jobs class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24468/w24468.pdf href=https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24468/w24468.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24468/w24468.pdf>for one-fifth of all American jobs</a>. More significantly, it supported the livelihood of one-third of American men between the ages of 21 and 55 with a high school education or below. Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin were decimated, losing <a aria-label=5.5 million jobs class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24468/w24468.pdf href=https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24468/w24468.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24468/w24468.pdf>5.5 million jobs</a> since the start of the new millennium.For too long, this has been a problem without answers for America’s Middle Class. The struggle to replace these jobs has been an unrealized priority of presidents from both political parties. Politicians blame foreign competition, burdensome regulation, technical automation, and corporate outsourcing, but for Rust Belt Americans there has been too much talk with too little progress.However, there is hope. Bitcoin is uniquely poised to address this problem. Its industry thrives in exactly the communities domestic manufacturers abandoned long ago.<strong>Bitcoin Mining Is Big Business </strong>Bitcoin mining is a process where large numbers of specialty computers are deployed to secure the monetary network. The business is not wholly different from large-scale data center operations. Miners generate the computations necessary for Bitcoin’s operation and security, and receive new money issued by the software. They secure transactions on a global public ledger, which anyone can verify.Bitcoin miners consume megawatts of electricity. The power requirements are similar to auto factories or smelting plants. Hence, these businesses are finding the factories of the Rust Belt an attractive destination. This is a notable trend. No other industry currently offers a competing vision for how to revive these decommissioned facilities.Unlike today’s manufacturers, which are reducing jobs through specialization, Bitcoin miners have the need for a large variety of employees. Jobs are centered on equipment repair, and facilities management. They may also require expertise in construction, HVAC, and electrical engineering as well as finance, sales and marketing. Jobs in the Bitcoin sector are also high-paying. The <a aria-label=industry average for salaries is around $108,000 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Cryptocurrency-Salary href=https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Cryptocurrency-Salary rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Cryptocurrency-Salary>industry average for salaries is around $108,000</a> per year. That could go a long way in areas that badly need to replace manufacturing employment. <strong>Rebuilding Manufacturing Towns</strong>A great example of the revitalization Bitcoin mining can bring comes from the small town of Rockdale, Texas. Rockdale was hit hard when one of the nation’s top aluminum smelters, the town’s largest employer, shut down. Today, the story couldn’t be more different.This former manufacturing town had just the abundant energy Bitcoin mining facilities needed. Attracted by this infrastructure, Riot Blockchain, a publicly traded company, was inspired to build a brand-new 300-megawatt mining facility in the town.Two hundred construction workers were <a aria-label=dedicated to the revival effort class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fox7austin.com/news/rockdale-boom-bitcoin-mining-companies-move-to-rural-texas-town href=https://www.fox7austin.com/news/rockdale-boom-bitcoin-mining-companies-move-to-rural-texas-town rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fox7austin.com/news/rockdale-boom-bitcoin-mining-companies-move-to-rural-texas-town>dedicated to the revival effort</a>, and as of 2021, Riot is producing 500 bitcoins per month ($22 million) at this facility. Emboldened by this success, Riot is expanding further. It is building more facilities in Rockdale and creating even more local jobs as its business grows.<strong>Promoting Renewable Energy </strong>Offsetting excitement about job creation in rural America are concerns about the demand Bitcoin miners place on our vital national electrical grid. Environmental justice and climate change are concerns for voters, including many swing-state independents. But the facts on Bitcoin mining do not match accusations leveled by critics.Bitcoin is not dependent on how its energy is supplied. There is nothing about mining equipment that needs to use coal or burn oil. What’s more, miners are portable and can go directly to untapped green power sources. Say an American energy business wants to build a new facility to harness our untapped wind, hydro-electric, or solar energy, they can now mine Bitcoin to recoup costs prior to connecting to the grid. A lot of renewable energy is not portable, so energy costs vary significantly based on location and timing. Wind energy outside Fargo is worth less than wind energy outside Chicago, and solar energy in the middle of the day is cheaper than in the morning. Miners, however, are highly flexible. All miners need to sell Bitcoin to the global market is an internet connection and a supply of energy. Already, this is having a powerful impact. A 2021 report shows that 57% of all American Bitcoin mining is conducted with sustainable power sources.<strong>​​Grid Stabilization</strong>Bitcoin mining finances the construction of renewable energy production by providing a guaranteed consumer. Once connected to the grid, miners can balance out the fluctuating energy supply from renewables like solar and wind. They are responsible consumers of energy, mining bitcoins during times of low demand, and serving the grid during times of peak demand. This ensures other electricity customers do not suffer rolling blackouts. Utilities call this a controlled load resource, and miners are a fast-responding, large-scale resource.Both Bitcoin mining and gas turbines close the gap between supply and demand, but gas turbines do it by raising supply, whereas Bitcoin miners do it by reducing demand.Mining finances the initial buildout of renewable energy production, ahead of connection to the grid, and once connected, it continues to finance the operations of the utility. This addresses a key challenge for renewable energy: matching supply and demand.<strong>Stranded Energy</strong>Even more promising is how Bitcoin mining makes investing in stranded and renewable energies more cost effective for entrepreneurs and energy consumers. Bitcoin miners can set up at the site of energy production, and use energy that would otherwise go wasted. This is called stranded energy, because there’s no economical way to get the energy to where it might be used. One example of stranded energy is flare gas. Petroleum wells are located in remote rural areas, and there are often no pipelines that can transport this gas to the market. This means most producers vent or flare that gas into the atmosphere, adding pollution and wasting a potential source of energy. Because Bitcoin miners are portable, they can run <a aria-label=off of flare gas class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/oil-drillers-bitcoin-miners-bond-over-natural-gas-2021-05-21/ href=https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/oil-drillers-bitcoin-miners-bond-over-natural-gas-2021-05-21/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/oil-drillers-bitcoin-miners-bond-over-natural-gas-2021-05-21/>off of flare gas</a>, and this has already become an industry of its own. There are companies that mine Bitcoin using shipping containers and tractor trailers filled with specialty equipment. These can pull into a remote oil field, even one surrounded by snow, farms or desert, and mine Bitcoin.Dairy and pork farmers are even using animal waste, processing it on site and using the energy to mine Bitcoin, as an alternative to risking water table contamination in landfills. This naturally occurring methane product, which has high amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, is now being repurposed as fuel for mining. Utilizing an overlooked stranded resource, mining could benefit the balance sheets of America’s farmers, an industry with notoriously slim margins. In short, with Bitcoin, there is now a viable use for America’s stranded energy. If aided by smart policy, it could bring revenue to rural communities, strengthening our energy grid and reducing pollution.<strong>Alternatives to Bitcoin Mining</strong>The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is not it's only popular misconception.Many politicians want to encourage the development of <a aria-label=alternative cryptocurrencies class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45863.pdf href=https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45863.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45863.pdf>alternative cryptocurrencies</a> on the basis they are less energy reliant. But while these ambitions are well-intentioned, the investors backing these networks lack an understanding of Bitcoin’s design and the drawbacks that come from these modifications. As outlined before in this book, Bitcoin is decentralized. No individual enjoys special privilege over any others. This is unlike our current financial system where there are distinct advantages for gatekeepers and the wealthy. Key to Bitcoin’s decentralization is the free market competition for Bitcoin enabled by proof-of-work, the consensus method that requires Bitcoin mining. Proof-of-work allows anyone from anywhere in the world to mine Bitcoin, whether this is a farmer in rural Iowa or an ambitious stranded energy producer in remote Alaska. Miners just have to follow the rules and provide computation.Alternative models do away with this system, removing the need for energy, and they do not create jobs or stabilize our energy grid. These systems share many of the same pitfalls as our traditional financial system, only with new gatekeepers.<em>“Bitcoin and the American Dream” is </em><a aria-label=now available in full on Amazon class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z href=https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-American-Dream-Technology-Transcending/dp/B09P7RL79Z>now available in full on Amazon</em></a><em>.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;A Bitcoin journalist since 2013, I'm one of the longest-tenured writers specializing in the field of cryptocurrency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Editor at Bitcoin Magazine and Editor-at-Large at the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, I conduct archival research on Bitcoin's history, working to highlight and identify the people and events that most impacted its development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am best known as a founding writer and editor for CoinDesk, where I served as Editor in Chief from 2014 to 2019.

There is a point where adoption rates begin to rise and do not look back [...] Precise numbers aside, there is no doubt that global cryptocurrency adoption is rising, and could soon hit a hyper-inflection point.However, the team—part of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the research division of Wells Fargo Wealth and Investment Management—cautioned that cryptocurrency investment options today are still maturing and they advise patience, adding they are hopeful that greater regulatory clarity in 2022 brings higher quality investment options.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>Wells Fargo analysts argue that bitcoin and crypto adoption is following a similar trend to internet <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Meanwhile, a sudden sell-off that hit bitcoin, ethereum and others late last year was triggered by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will repeatedly hike rates this year, increasing the cost of borrowing and beginning to taper its pandemic-era stimulus measures. The crypto price crash—hitting all major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, cardano and XRP—has sparked fears that a new so-called crypto winter could be setting in, similar to the 2018 bear market that saw many of the biggest coins lose 90% of their value. Even though the current crypto trend looks bearish, we have to take in consideration that the structure of crypto investments is quite different now compared to the previous peaks at the end of 2017, Andras Ivan, an analyst at international broker comparison site BrokerChooser, said in emailed comments. The market cap is significantly higher now and institutional investors joined in the past 1-2 years. That might help the market to avoid such serious drops and disappearing interest that we experienced in the crypto winter of 2018-2019.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Feb 8 2022 02:30pm ,"Paige Bueckers of the UConn Huskies celebrates her three point basket in the first quarter against the Baylor Lady Bears during the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament at the Alamodome on March 29, 2021 in San Antonio, Texas.University of Connecticut basketball star Paige Beuckers announced a new partnership Monday that’s sure to add to her buckets of cash off the court.The reigning Naismith College Player of the Year is partnering with Cash App, the mobile payment service owned by Jack Dorsey’s Block (formerly Square), to help launch the Paige Bueckers Foundation. Although specific details have yet to be released, the foundation will broadly focus on creating opportunities for children and families and promoting social justice. Cash App plans to endow an initial $100,000 Bitcoin donation, in addition to $100,000 in cash that will be given away to fans in $15 payments to promote the announcement. Other financial terms were not disclosed, but <em>Forbes </em>estimates that Bueckers is still a few deals away from hitting the $1 million mark in endorsements.“I know this deal isn't like a super long-term contract,” Bueckers tells <em>Forbes</em>. “But I'm working with people and want to work with people who have the same values as me.”This marks Bueckers’ third major partnership since the NCAA stripped down its regulations in July, allowing college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness. She signed with global e-commerce platform StockX in October and, one month later, became the first college athlete to join Gatorade’s ranks. In July, Bueckers trademarked the phrase “Paige Buckets,” which is the point guard’s nickname. How Bueckers fares in the nascent NIL market could offer a glimpse of the opportunities emerging for the top tier of college athletes. Based on her sprawling social media presence—Bueckers has more than one million followers between Twitter and Instagram—a study from research outlet AthleticDirectorU named her <a aria-label=the most marketable athlete class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.athleticdirectoru.com/sanil/analyzing-the-potential-of-basketball-players-nil/ href=https://www.athleticdirectoru.com/sanil/analyzing-the-potential-of-basketball-players-nil/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.athleticdirectoru.com/sanil/analyzing-the-potential-of-basketball-players-nil/>the most marketable athlete</a> in college sports prior to the NCAA’s rule change.“She is the best of the best, and these major brands want to leverage her appeal, particularly to a young and growing demographic,” Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business associate professor Tim Derdenger wrote in an email. “Her success will certainly spill over to other players.”It already has. Last month, Gonzaga forward Chet Holmgren <a aria-label=signed a deal class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristidosh/2022/01/12/gonzagas-chet-holmgren-lands-largest-nil-deal-yet-from-topps/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristidosh/2022/01/12/gonzagas-chet-holmgren-lands-largest-nil-deal-yet-from-topps/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristidosh/2022/01/12/gonzagas-chet-holmgren-lands-largest-nil-deal-yet-from-topps/>signed a deal</a> with Topps that the company said was its largest with a college athlete to date.

In November, Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers announced they were partnering with Cash App and taking part of their salaries in Bitcoin. Golden State Warriors stars Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala said they would be doing the same in January. As cryptocurrency becomes a hot topic among athlete investors, at least ten North American-based professional athletes have <a aria-label=taken part of their salaries class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2022/01/26/bitcoin-bummer-rodgers-beckham-jr-and-other-sports-stars-hit-hard-by-plummeting-crypto-currencies/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2022/01/26/bitcoin-bummer-rodgers-beckham-jr-and-other-sports-stars-hit-hard-by-plummeting-crypto-currencies/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2022/01/26/bitcoin-bummer-rodgers-beckham-jr-and-other-sports-stars-hit-hard-by-plummeting-crypto-currencies/>taken part of their salaries</a> or endorsement payments in some form of crypto.“Obviously, I’m still learning a lot about it and trying to understand,” Bueckers says. “I just started understanding what to do with my tax money, so now I have to learn what to do with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.”A native of Hopkins, Minnesota, Bueckers arrived at UConn in 2020 as the top-ranked recruit in the United States and the 2019-20 Gatorade Female Athlete of the Year. She collected a string of awards during her freshman season and led the heavily favored Huskies to the Final Four, where they were upset by the University of Arizona. Bueckers picked up where she left off during her sophomore campaign before suffering a fracture in her left knee, which has sidelined her for the last two months. She hopes to return at the end of February.As she adds to her sponsorship portfolio, Bueckers plans to continue to use her platform to advocate for racial equity. At the 2021 ESPYs, where she won the award for best college athlete in women’s sports, Bueckers used her speech to honor and celebrate Black women.

Feb 8 2022 12:51pm ,"U.S. authorities arrested a New York City couple Tuesday for allegedly conspiring to launder $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin stolen during a hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex in 2016, $3.6 billion of which federal authorities have recovered in what the Department of Justice is calling the largest financial seizure ever.  Bitcoin prices fell sharply after news of the seizure, which authorities called their largest ever.According to court <a aria-label=filings class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470181/download href=https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470181/download rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470181/download>filings</a>, 34-year-old Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoins—currently worth about $5 billion—that were stolen from the Bitfinex platform after a breach of the cryptocurrency exchange's systems in 2016.At the time, the unnamed hacker allegedly made more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions transferring the stolen cryptocurrency to a digital wallet under Lichntenstein's control, authorities <a aria-label=said class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency href=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency>said</a> Tuesday.They allege Lichentenstein and Morgan then employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques—including using fake identities to set up online accounts and running computer programs to automate transactions—to transfer about 25,000 stolen coins out of the wallet and into financial accounts jointly controlled by the couple over the next five years.According to the DOJ on Tuesday, special agents obtained court-authorized search warrants to go through the couple's online accounts and were able to find files containing the private keys required to access a digital wallet containing 94,000 bitcoins representing about $3.6 billion in stolen funds.In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco <a aria-label=said class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency href=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency>said</a> the recovered funds marked the DOJ's largest financial seizure ever and called the case proof that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals.The couple has been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years.The price of bitcoin pared recent gains after the announcement, falling nearly 2% to $42,910.“Cryptocurrency and the virtual currency exchanges trading in it comprise an expanding part of the U.S. financial system, but digital currency heists executed through complex money laundering schemes could undermine confidence in cryptocurrency,” U.S. Attorney Matthew M.

In both instances, the companies paid millions in bitcoin to hackers taking advantage of the cryptocurrency's anonymized transactions. “The only way you can begin to get on top of the pervasive” ransomware problem is “to develop a pattern,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said last summer after the DOJ seized $2.3 million in bitcoin as part of its investigation into Colonial Pipeline.

After rising to a more-than one-month high, bitcoin prices pulled back, experiencing some rather modest declines and dropping close to $43,500 this evening. At the time of this writing, the digital asset was trading close to $44,000. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Following bitcoin’s recent price movements, several market observers highlighted key technical levels, as well as other important factors, when emphasizing what traders need to know. Mark Elenowitz, co-founder of Ethereum-powered exchange <a aria-label=Upstream class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://upstream.exchange/ href=https://upstream.exchange/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://upstream.exchange/>Upstream</a>, offered some insight on the situation. “The next point of resistance, I suspect, is around $46,000. If that is broken, then we could very easily swing past $50,000.” “But if that isn’t broken in the coming days, then support seems to be hovering at around $38,000. And if the latter plays out, then we could be in for a few weeks of range-bound price action.” Ben Armstrong, founder of<a aria-label=BitBoy Crypto class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitboycrypto.com/ href=https://bitboycrypto.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitboycrypto.com/> BitBoy Crypto</a>, also weighed in on the matter. “Right now many crypto analysts are warning about a possible Bitcoin bull trap. The sentiment in crypto has turned very quickly and many investors are hopeful for a renewed bull run,” he noted. “The number to watch for here is $46k-$47k. Many people have been targeting this range for a relief rally before further downward action and possibly a retest of the $29k level,” said Armstrong. “We should be looking for Bitcoin to hold the $40,000 level as support to fend off a larger downswing.” Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner of <a aria-label=Fairlead Strategies, LLC class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/ href=https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/>Fairlead Strategies, LLC</a>, also offered some insight in her daily note. “If today’s breakout holds tomorrow, a bullish short- term bias would be dictated with next resistance near $46.7K based on a Fibonacci retracement level,” she stated. Her note offered further detail on the crypto markets: “From an intermediate-term perspective, we are moving from bearish to neutral, noting there is a weekly oversold upturn and a more pronounced loss of downside momentum.” “That said, we see risk of additional corrective price action in the equity market that could be a drag on risk assets, in general,” said Stockton. “Bitcoin shares a loss of long-term momentum with the equity market, suggesting a wide trading range has unfolded in which shorter-term views will shift.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Bitcoin crashed around 50% from its all-time highs during the two months to January, falling to around $32,000 per bitcoin. Farrell also predicted the ethereum price could soar to $12,000 per ether thanks to the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other Web 3 applications, adding ethereum is undervalued relative to cloud platforms.Bitcoin, ethereum and most other major cryptocurrencies fell sharply through the final months of last year and into 2022 as investors fretted over looming interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, causing surging stock markets to stall.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last year with bitcoin, ethereum and other major <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices reached their highest in a month today. Bitcoin prices rallied today, rising to their loftiest value in more than a month as the latest signs of institutional adoption helped strengthen the optimism of market participants. The world’s most prominent digital currency reached $44,508 around 2:30 p.m. EST, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading at its highest since January 5, additional CoinDesk figures reveal.Further, the digital asset was up more than 30% from the recent low of roughly $33,000 it hit late last month. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] <strong>Institutional Adoption</strong>When explaining these latest price movements, multiple analysts pointed to recent signs that organizations are embracing bitcoin. Earlier today, KPMG Canada, the Toronto-based branch of professional services firm KPMG, announced that it had purchased some bitcoin, as well as its digital sibling ether, CoinDesk <a aria-label=reported class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/07/kpmg-canada-adds-crypto-to-its-balance-sheet/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/07/kpmg-canada-adds-crypto-to-its-balance-sheet/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/07/kpmg-canada-adds-crypto-to-its-balance-sheet/>reported</a>.

Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a aria-label=BitBull Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ href=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/>BitBull Capital</a>, offered similar input. “The bounce from low 30 thousands gave the market confidence and we saw sentiment improving over the last few days,” he noted. “Today news of Tesla maintaining its BTC holdings and KPMG Canada adding BTC to its balance sheet have also bolstered sentiment,” emphasized DiPasquale.Josh Olszewicz, head of research at <a aria-label=Valkyrie Investments class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://valkyrieinvest.com/ href=https://valkyrieinvest.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://valkyrieinvest.com/>Valkyrie Investments</a>, also spoke to these developments, noting how they are simply the latest sign of progress for cryptocurrencies. “KPMG Canada, a big four accounting firm, announced today they will be holding BTC and ETH in their corporate treasury. The new allocation represents a growing list of significant institutional adoption and maturation of an emerging asset class.” <strong>Lawmakers Embrace Bitcoin</strong>Andrew Rossow, an internet and technology attorney, also spoke to adoption, but took a different angle, focusing on the actions of U.S. government officials. “From a legal perspective, I believe a huge source of credit comes from Congress, with many members of the U.S. Senate speaking favorably on Bitcoin,” he stated. “On Friday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz disclosed that he invested in $50K worth of bitcoin during its dip back in Jan., which lended additional favor to Texas's journey towards becoming a notable bitcoin mining hub,” said Rossow. “This cannot be overlooked, regardless of your political affiliations.” <strong>Market Dynamics </strong>In an effort to shed further light on current market conditions, as well as provide some clarity on what might come next, Olszewicz highlighted some important key factors. “Crypto derivative funding rates still lean negative, even with rising price and open interest, suggestive of on-going short interest,” he stated. “Price may continue upward momentum so long as shorts continue to get squeezed and are forced to cover positions or become liquidated.” Further, he spoke to the relationship between the price movements of digital currencies and the values of major indices like the S&amp;P 500. “Crypto also continued to decouple from traditional finance indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, throughout the day,” said Olszewicz. “Strong correlations between crypto and these indices held through the month of January, but began to break after the non-farm payroll numbers were released on Friday. A decorrelation between the two sectors could be suggestive of returning risk-on sentiment in Crypto.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Feb 7 2022 11:37am ,"Electric carmaker Tesla revealed in a public filing Monday that the value of its bitcoin holdings ballooned to nearly $2 billion by the end of December, confirming the firm helmed by billionaire Elon Musk sold no cryptocurrency in the latter half of last year and cementing its position as the U.S. corporation with the second-largest bitcoin stash.  Despite a $101 million impairment loss last year, Tesla’s crypto stash is worth more than the <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Shortly after Tesla lifted bitcoin to new price highs after announcing its $1.5 billion investment in February, prices crashed nearly 20% when Musk said prices seemed “a little high” on Twitter. Though bitcoin reached a new peak of $69,000 in November, the cryptocurrency has experienced several 20% drawbacks over the past year, including in May when Tesla <a aria-label=announced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-for-car-purchases.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-for-car-purchases.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-for-car-purchases.html>announced</a> it would stop investing in bitcoin—or accepting it as a form of payment for its vehicles—because of the industry’s toll on the environment. At about $43,888 on Monday, the price of bitcoin is up 13% over the past year, but down 35% from its all-time high.Whether—or when—Tesla will once again invest in bitcoin, or accept it as a form of payment. On Monday, the firm said it “may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time” based on market and environmental conditions, but it gave no further details about its cryptocurrency future. “Investing in bitcoin puts a company’s cash at risk of unnecessary volatility and potential losses,” Jerry Klein, the managing director of $19 billion advisory Treasury Partners, wrote in emailed comments last week. Accounting rules require corporations to treat bitcoin as an intangible asset, Klein says, meaning firms must write down the value if the price declines, but can’t write up the value if the price appreciates. “This creates a no-win situation from an accounting standpoint,” he notes.<a aria-label=Tesla's Bitcoin Investment Fell $1 Billion In Second Quarter Amid Crypto Market Crash class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/27/teslas-bitcoin-investment-fell-1-billion-last-quarter-amid-crypto-market-crash/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/27/teslas-bitcoin-investment-fell-1-billion-last-quarter-amid-crypto-market-crash/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/27/teslas-bitcoin-investment-fell-1-billion-last-quarter-amid-crypto-market-crash/>Tesla's Bitcoin Investment Fell $1 Billion In Second Quarter Amid Crypto Market Crash</a> <em>(Forbes)</em><a aria-label=Billionaire Saylor's MicroStrategy Bought $25 Million In Bitcoin During Last Month's $500 Billion Crypto Market Crash class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/02/01/billionaire-saylors-microstrategy-bought-25-million-in-bitcoin-during-last-months-500-billion-crypto-market-crash/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/02/01/billionaire-saylors-microstrategy-bought-25-million-in-bitcoin-during-last-months-500-billion-crypto-market-crash/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/02/01/billionaire-saylors-microstrategy-bought-25-million-in-bitcoin-during-last-months-500-billion-crypto-market-crash/>Billionaire Saylor's MicroStrategy Bought $25 Million In Bitcoin During Last Month's $500 Billion Crypto Market Crash</a> <em>(Forbes)</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I'm a senior reporter at Forbes focusing on markets and finance.

Mar 5 2022 02:18pm ,"Investors are not being paid for their risks in Bitcoin versus the Nasdaq.It’s been a wild start of the year for crypto. Anyone with a Coinbase account has been getting notifications on their phones: Bitcoin up 5% on Monday. Bitcoin down 6% on Tuesday. Anyone who thought that the cryptocurrency markets would not correlate with traditional markets is having their assumptions challenged. It looks like Bitcoin is tracking the Nasdaq, which means big investors are making the same moves: sell Facebook, sell Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency investors want something other than a double leveraged QQQ. This is supposed to be a whole new world. What is happening with these correlations? Over the last month, Bitcoin is down 12.9% against the dollar. The Invesco Nasdaq ETF (QQQ) is down 10%. Bitcoin looks like a slightly more beta version of the QQQ.“There is a higher correlation today than there was six months ago,” says Martin Green, co-founder and CEO of Cambrian Asset Management. Over the last three years, the Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation was .2 but “in the last several weeks, I’d say it has doubled to around point four,” Green says. Correlations aren’t always the perfect guidepost of a market’s direction. “Lots of people look at correlations as if it is a great number in and of itself, but what is really important is that there are times when things are very highly correlated, and there are times when they are not; and there are times when they are correlated when the market is going up, or only when prices are going down,” says Green. “I would say that recently along the two axis – up and down – Bitcoin and tech stocks are in tandem because of interest rates and inflation concerns that have affected stocks and crypto. Bitcoin and the Nasdaq were neck and neck for much of 2019. Bitcoin pulled away hard in 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, as investors assumed a market crash and were looking elsewhere to put their money. Over the last two years, Bitcoin is up 320% to the Nasdaq’s respectable 56%.“Crypto was originally intended to be a separate decentralized environment, independent of traditional markets. Things have changed considerably since then,” says Mike Ermolaev, a spokesman for ChangeNOW, a five-year-old Seychelles-based cryptocurrency company whose core product is an exchange platform trading over 380 digital assets and 60 fiat currencies. The fast adoption of Bitcoin among companies and institutions could add to it being treated by those money managers like a Facebook and Google stock. “There has been a lot of money flowing into crypto from traditional markets these past couple years,” says Ermolaev. “During that time, traditional markets and cryptocurrency markets have converged. It’s evident from various indicators that tech stocks and Bitcoin are strongly correlated right now.”That means the same factors that send tech stocks lower, like monetary policy, rising inflation, and weakening demand for some key tech product lines — like Facebook recently — can weigh on sentiment for crypto. It's a risk-off sentiment across the board.The recent sell-off in the market — both for Bitcoin, the Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P 500, has brought out the usual bear market pundits. The end is always near. Still, the good news for retail cryptocurrency investors is that while Bitcoin tracks the market over a short period of time, the crypto investing market is becoming more mature. Investors are becoming smarter and thinking longer term. These institutional investors, and retail ‘hodlers’ (that’s not a typo) are less likely to trade crypto like they’re in a Macau casino. Some in the industry think crypto investing can be safer than tech stocks. It all depends on the investment. “The top crypto projects, such as the top 100 by market cap, aren’t much different than traditional stocks in terms of risk,” says Elvin Aziyev, CEO and co-founder of Dubai-based Metafluence, a start-up that gives social media influencers a chance to monetize their popularity in the metaverse — a new type of virtual reality currently in its nascent stage.Aziyev said the recent sell-off affected their product launch and trading volume.“This resembles the early 2018 sell-off a bit,” Aziyev says, adding that he’s not worried about the ups and downs of Bitcoin pricing. “I don’t think it’s going to follow the same path this time.”The bears would say it can only get worse.Who’s buying that line? QQQ x BTC over a five week trading period and over a 12 month period. Not paid much for the <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> volatility.</span><strong>Buy Now? Pay Later?</strong>Never catch a falling knife. Every investor knows that old adage. “We have probably around 200 investors across numerous vehicles and we have not had one email or call from any of them asking about the crypto volatility or about how the fund is doing. Not one,” says Green.Retail investors may want to take a more wait-and-see approach, build up cash, and then buy more discounted Bitcoin. It seems the recent sell-off has bottomed out, and Bitcoin, like the Nasdaq, is in a holding pattern. Where it goes from here is anybody’s guess.“I am definitely not nervous,” says Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner of STORM Partners, a blockchain solutions provider based in in Montreux, Switzerland. “Every sell off is different, although this one might be particularly distinct due to the levels of global adoption that we have seen before.”The role played by institutional investors — whether it’s Tesla or Goldman Sachs — coupled with the selling appetite of Bitcoin whales matters here. If the two sides are going to think the same, then Bitcoin will be nothing more than a riskier Nasdaq, only good for the cash rich who can stomach deep declines and treat them as buying opportunities. For the retail investor with a few hundred dollars in cash to be deployed, it’s a demotivator. Buying Bitcoin becomes like learning to invest in energy and tech stocks at a time when Enron is going bust, California energy deregulation is killing Calpine shares, and WorldCom vanishes as a going concern. These are all real risks the retail investor faces in steep downturns of Bitcoin. And right now, Bitcoin is down over 30% from it’s all-time highs. That’s a bear market at the moment for Bitcoin.All of this can change in a day. And we have been here before with Bitcoin.“I have been in crypto for a long time. For those of us truly old crypto investors and builders who lived through 2017, nothing will ever be similar to that,” says Leah Allegra, CEO and founder of RugDoc, a U.S. based platform for decentralized finance education, security, and yield strategies. She’s invested in yield-bearing crypto.“Investors are willing to ride this out,” she says. “When Bitcoin dropped down to $29,000 in July and when it recently dropped down to $35,000, I didn’t see mass panic, I saw investors...looking for openings in the market that they could profit from in the meantime, such as switching from NFT trading to yield farming.”Worth noting about the slide, says Ermolaev in Seychelles, investor attention has also been diverted by energy concerns over Bitcoin mining which has had investors shifting into buying new blockchain protocols. The growth of the metaverse and decentralized finance sectors have also shifted demand slightly. “Long-term crypto investors seem unfazed,” Ermolaev says about the Bitcoin bear market. “They plan to keep holding for the long haul. For me, the red flag support level for BTC is $30,000.”Since Bitcoin began, there has been around 80% drawdowns and multiple 50% drawdowns. It recently went through another 50% drawdown since November. Bitcoin investor rival, Ethereum (ETH), went through a 50% drawdown in May 2021. “This is the nature of investing in a very early-stage asset class,” says Green from Cambrian Asset Management. They run a quantitative fund for cryptocurrencies, trading around 68 different digital assets. “A year ago, we only invested in 18 different digital assets,” Green says. About Bitcoin: “It’s going to be very volatile. When these drawdowns happen, don’t be a panic seller. If there’s no risk, there’s no return.”Bitcoin decoupled massively from the Nasdaq in late 2020.<em>The writer invests in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I write about global business trends, big business dramas and investing, primarily in emerging markets.

This legislation is an important step forward, and it lays the groundwork for growing the digital economy.Designed to simplify tax burdens on daily crypto users who must now report even the smallest capital gains, the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act—an amendment to the Internal Revenue Service's tax code—was announced this week by crypto-friendly representatives Schweikert, Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and would retroactively apply to all qualifying transactions from December 31, 2021 if the legislation becomes law.Emmer, Schweikert and Soto are co-chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, a congressional group that now counts 35 lawmakers as members.Not only will this create a level playing field for digital currencies, it will also help unleash innovation on applications like micropayments, which can consist of dozens of transactions per minute and thus are difficult to square with the current law, said Jerry Brito, executive director of cryptocurrency think tank Coin Center, who has lobbied for the bill. Currently, bitcoin and crypto users must report changes in a cryptocurrency’s value in dollars from when they purchased the crypto to when it was used in a transaction, including small retail purchases.While bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are technologically innovative payment methods, today you have to keep track of and report every transaction you make using them, whether it’s a $10,000 investment trade or whether you’re buying a 99¢ song online or a latte at a café, added Brito. This obviously creates friction and puts cryptocurrencies at a disadvantage relative to other digital payment methods.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has surged 10% over the last week after a period of stagnation for bitcoin, <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Last month, Tesla began allowing people to buy branded merchandise using dogecoin.As the use of virtual currencies for retail payments increases, it's important that Americans are able to easily understand their tax obligations, said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association. By providing an exemption for small everyday purchases, the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act would ease this burden for consumers.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices have been trading north of $40,000 since late morning EST.

Once those shackles were removed, a more ‘natural’ price movement took over,” he stated. “The news in the crypto space has generally been good, certainly nothing terribly bad hasn’t emerged (although WormHole hasn’t helped) and “only” the pending new rules in the US regarding crypto loom as a possible negative,” said Enneking. “In short, there was no reason for the price to be down here in the first place other than the ‘risk off’ mentality that leaked over from fiat markets resulting in the very high recent correlation. That now appears to have ended, letting crypto take its natural course,” he stated. <strong>Short Squeeze</strong>Analysts also highlighted the amount of short interest that existed before the price increase took place, a situation that could have easily amplified bitcoin’s gains. “One of the reasons for the strength of the move was the large amount of short interest that had been opened in the $30,000 range, forcing bears to close their positions,” said Dylan LeClair, head of market research for <a aria-label=Bitcoin Magazine class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/>Bitcoin Magazine</a>. “Our analysis highlights that previous bitcoin bottoms were marked by periods of derivative market bearishness, particularly when perpetual futures funding was negative for prolonged periods of time,” he stated. “With the negative funding piling up, there was approximately $53 million in total short liquidations over the last eight hours helping to send bitcoin over $40,000.”<strong>Additional Considerations</strong>Aside from the factors listed above, several other developments may have helped fuel today’s bitcoin rally. Olszewicz highlighted some of these matters, stating that “Other factors potentially leading to Bitcoin's rally today include a persistent negative funding rate on derivatives, which often happens when shorts are paying longs.” “Additionally, the put/call ratio for all options maturities was the highest since late 2018, a potential indication of a crowded trade, and shorts haven't really been pressured or liquidated since last November’s highs,” he stated. “Finally, the fear &amp; greed sentiment index has been holding below 30 since January 1st, which is normally an indication of oversold markets,” the analyst stated.At the time of this writing, the <a aria-label=Fear And Greed Index class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index/ href=https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index/>Fear And Greed Index</a> was at 20, pointing to “Extreme Fear.” The Fear And Greed Index from Look Into Bitcoin (lookintobitcoin.com) <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

The consumer price index climbed 7% in 2021, the largest 12-month gain since June 1982. Soaring wages could mean the U.S. Federal Reserve takes an even more aggressive stance on inflation this year, with the market already pricing in an interest rate hike in March. January jobs data was shockingly strong, Callie Cox, analyst at trading platform eToro said in emailed comments, calling the report a huge deal. This is a robust job market, and it reinforces the Fed’s decision to hike rates.All of this is more ammunition for Fed hawks to push even harder and makes it more likely that the central bank will embark on an aggressive series of interest rate hikes in 2022, Mike Owens, global sales trader at Saxo Markets, wrote in emailed comments. But the big question is will we get a 50-basis points hike in March?Meanwhile, online retailer Amazon reinvigorated stocks this morning, with its strong post-earnings rally wiping away the bad taste that Meta's major miss left in investors' mouths.The bitcoin price crash over the last few months has weighed on the idea that bitcoin could act as a hedge against inflation—an idea popularized by famed investor Paul Tudor Jones in 2020. Tudor Jones called bitcoin the fastest horse to beat inflation, however, the bitcoin price fell sharply late last year along with stock markets after the Fed admitted it would have to raise interest rates to cool the red-hot economy. In the last two years, risk-on equities and bitcoin have been positively correlated, BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale said via email. This was not the case overall previously. This week, the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 have recovered where they were before January 21, the day bitcoin sold off from $43,000 to $35,000.

Mar 6 2022 09:02am ,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are wrapping up the lackluster week on a high note. Today the bitcoin price rose 3.2%. Ethereum’s price jumped 8%. BNB leapt 3.8%, cardano 2.8%, XRP 2.7%, and solana 8.5%. Meanwhile, SEC watchdogs are plotting to ambush crypto markets with a “Trojan Horse” regulation.Last week, the SEC introduced a seemingly unrelated 654-page plan aimed at regulating “Treasury markets platforms.” Pro-crypto Commissioner Hester Peirce, however, warns it’s a sweeping crypto regulation in disguise. While the proposal doesn’t mention crypto, its new rules would let regulators probe into crypto platforms and even decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The SEC Chairman Gary Gensler The proposal includes very expansive language, which, together with the chair’s apparent interest in regulating all things crypto, suggests that it could be used to regulate crypto platforms, Peirce wrote in an email, as <a aria-label=reported by Bloomberg class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-01/sec-s-peirce-sees-threat-to-crypto-defi-platforms-in-agency-plan?sref=3REHEaVI href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-01/sec-s-peirce-sees-threat-to-crypto-defi-platforms-in-agency-plan?sref=3REHEaVI rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-01/sec-s-peirce-sees-threat-to-crypto-defi-platforms-in-agency-plan?sref=3REHEaVI>reported by Bloomberg</a>” She added: “The proposal could reach more types of trading mechanisms, including potentially DeFi protocols.”<em>[Ed note: Investing in crypto is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]</em><strong>Zooming out</strong>Technically, <a aria-label=the SEC class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/files/34-94062-fact-sheet.pdf href=https://www.sec.gov/files/34-94062-fact-sheet.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/files/34-94062-fact-sheet.pdf>the SEC</a> is proposing to “expand Regulation ATS for alternative trading systems (ATS) that trade government securities, NMS stock, and other securities,” “extend Regulation SCI to ATSs that trade government securities” and “amend the SEC rule regarding the definition of an ‘exchange’.According to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the amendments aim to close a “regulatory gap” stemming from trading platforms that aren’t registered as exchanges or brokerages with the SEC. He also noted the proposed rules would extend existing regulations concerning platforms that trade <em>Treasuries and other government securities</em>.This proposal would bind those platforms to register and be subject to regulation, which would “promote resiliency and greater access in the Treasury market.”However, Peirce thinks this expansion of the exchange definition could also serve as a backdoor way to rein in crypto. “The expansive definition that's being proposed for exchanges will cover a lot of potential platforms that haven't thought necessarily that they would be covered and that's in the traditional security space, as well as in the crypto space,” she said during an <a aria-label=interview with Yahoo Finance class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-regulation-coming-just-not-this-year-se-cs-pierce-172824069.html href=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-regulation-coming-just-not-this-year-se-cs-pierce-172824069.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-regulation-coming-just-not-this-year-se-cs-pierce-172824069.html>interview with Yahoo Finance</a>.That aligns with the SEC chair’s <a aria-label=position for tighter DeFi oversight. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/19/defi-not-immune-to-sec-oversight-gensler-says-report/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/19/defi-not-immune-to-sec-oversight-gensler-says-report/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/19/defi-not-immune-to-sec-oversight-gensler-says-report/>position for tighter DeFi oversight. </a>In a <a aria-label=Wall Street Journal interview class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401 href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401>Wall Street Journal interview</a> last year, Gensler said that DeFi platforms aren’t exempt from market regulations: “Even though they are decentralized, with no central entity in charge, DeFi projects that reward participants with incentives or digital tokens could enter territory that is subject to SEC regulation.”<strong>Looking ahead</strong>There will be a 30-day window counting from January 26  for blockchain industry insiders, trading platforms, and other stakeholders to comment on the new SEC proposed plan.  Peirce thinks this is an unusually short comment period for such a significant regulatory proposal. Coupled with Biden’s planned executive order, that may reflect regulators’ itch to tighten the grip on the exploding decentralized finance market.After the comment period, the SEC will hold another vote to reach the final decision.

Feb 3 2022 10:00am ,"Early team members of the Stacks project in 2017 outside their Soho office in NYC. Muneeb Ali is the first on the left.It’s summer 2017. Muneeb Ali, a PhD candidate in computer science at Princeton, is finishing his thesis, detailing his experience of building Blockstack—a decentralized blockchain-based internet, enabling users to own their data. Inspired by the founding father of modern computers and fellow Princeton graduate, Alan Turing, and the work of Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Ali was exploring applications beyond financial use cases that could be built atop the largest decentralized payments network. Fast forward to the present day. Dr. Ali has just raised $150 million to build New York-based Trust Machines, a company he co-founded with Princeton computer science professor Dr. JP Singh, which seeks to unleash what they consider “the true potential of bitcoin” by developing decentralized finance applications, DAOs and NFTs on the rebranded Blockstack, now called Stacks, a smart contracts network linked to bitcoin.Investors in the round include Breyer Capital, Union Square Ventures, Digital Currency Group, GoldenTree, Hivemind, among others. The valuation was not disclosed. At stake is the potential for bitcoin to thrive in Web3.“We believe that bitcoin can be more than a store of value; it can also be the settlement layer and platform for Web 3,” said Jim Breyer, founder and CEO of Breyer Capital and early Facebook investor. “We're excited to support Trust Machines and their mission to help bitcoin reach its potential.” The participation of high-profile investors like Breyer is a vote of confidence to bitcoin’s growth prospects. Despite its success, bitcoin’s ecosystem has seen slower development than other so-called Layer-1 chains, such as Ethereum and Solana, as of late. Unlike these networks and their respective assets, bitcoin has gained mainstream support as a “store of value” due to its scarcity. But this narrative is presently being challenged by bitcoin’s increasing correlation with risky assets like stocks. Trust Machines aims to convert bitcoin’s trillion-dollar value into more productive capital and grow an economy of bitcoin applications, according to Ali. “Bitcoin as a programmable Layer 1 is so underappreciated,” he laments.With raised capital, Trust Machines plans to aggressively hire bitcoin core developers to build products that would enable bitcoin investors to participate in the budding sector of decentralized finance, though the <a aria-label=lion's share of its value class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://defillama.com/chains href=https://defillama.com/chains rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://defillama.com/chains>lion's share of its value</a> is currently locked in Ethereum. Think yield-bearing opportunities for bitcoin holders, social applications, DAOs, bitcoin-native NFT experiences and swaps, to name a few.“Over the last four or five years, we've been building the infrastructure (Stacks) to make it possible to build those applications,” says Ali. “And now that the infrastructure has matured, we're building these applications.” Ali after his PhD thesis defense at Princeton University in 2017 standing next to Brian Kernighan, an early developer of the C programming language and UNIX operating system.Ali had first heard of bitcoin in 2011 from Princeton professor Arvind Narayanan, who later <a aria-label=wrote class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/ href=http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/>wrote</a> one of the most popular college textbooks on the subject and served on Ali’s thesis committee, but had not read Satoshi’s white paper for another two years. “One thing that really fascinated me,” he recounts, reflecting on Stacks’ beginnings, was “What else can we do with this technology?”To answer that question, Hiro, a New-York based company he cofounded to build developer tools for Stacks, has raised a combined $75 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Y Combinator, Winklevoss Capital, and even Harvard Management Co., the firm managing the university’s $41.9 billion endowment, which <a aria-label=bought class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/12/hmc-crypto-investment/ href=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/12/hmc-crypto-investment/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/12/hmc-crypto-investment/>bought</a> a cumulative $11.5 million in Stacks tokens in 2019. Last month, the Stacks mainnet celebrated its one-year anniversary with over 2,500 <a aria-label=smart contract deployments class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/stacks-ecosystem-becomes-1-web3-project-on-bitcoin-852190251.html href=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/stacks-ecosystem-becomes-1-web3-project-on-bitcoin-852190251.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/stacks-ecosystem-becomes-1-web3-project-on-bitcoin-852190251.html>smart contract deployments</a> and 50,000 wallet downloads.In many ways, bitcoin smart contracts could be considered the Holy Grail of crypto. Platforms like Stacks or RSK, another network supporting bitcoin smart contracts developed by Argentina-based IOVLavs, show that the developer ecosystem around bitcoin can innovate and enable support for Web 3.Hiro, which Ali has until now headed, will from now on be led by Alex Miller, currently Hiro’s Chief Operating Officer, though Ali will stay on as chairman of the board. Diwaker Gupta, currently VP of Technology, will take on the role of Hiro’s Chief Technology Officer. <p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I report on cryptocurrencies and other applications of blockchain technology.

Mar 6 2022 09:02am ,"Some cryptos enjoyed a small bounce this week, but the “winter” is far from over with prices well below last year’s highs. The price of bitcoin is down 44% from its highs. Ethereum’s price hovers 43%, BNB 45%, cardano 65%, XRP 70%, and solana 58% lower from their last year highs.Meanwhile, the world's largest asset manager <a aria-label=Fidelity released a paper class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-first.pdf href=https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-first.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-first.pdf>Fidelity released a paper</a> that calls bitcoin a “superior form of money.” It argues that bitcoin is lightyears ahead of competition and no crypto is likely to catch up to it “as a monetary good.”“Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset. No other digital asset is likely to improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure, decentralized, sound digital money and any “improvement” will necessarily face tradeoffs,” the paper wrote.<em>[Ed note: Investing in crypto is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]</em>Bitcoin <strong>Zooming out</strong>Fidelity’s bullish case for bitcoin rests on a few key reasons:<strong>New investors should consider bitcoin first</strong>Fidelity’s analysts suggest other digital assets can fulfil different needs, and they will continue to exist. But bitcoin will likely emerge as the ultimate digital store of value. And investors who want to dip their toes in crypto should consider bitcoin first.“Bitcoin’s first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology but as a superior form of money. As a monetary good, bitcoin is unique. Therefore, not only do we believe investors should consider bitcoin first in order to understand digital assets, but that bitcoin should be considered first and separate from all other digital assets that have come after it,” the paper wrote.That said, tread lightly. Bitcoin may well come out as a long-term winner in the crypto universe. But with central banks slamming on stimulus breaks and raising rates to rein in inflation, risk assets, including crypto could face strong headwinds this year. <strong>Stay ahead of crypto trends with Meanwhile in Markets…</strong>Every day, I put out a story that explains what’s driving the crypto markets.<a aria-label=Subscribe here class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ href=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/> Subscribe here</a> to get my analysis and crypto picks in your inbox.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I have worked as an equity and macro analyst in a number of financial research houses including Mauldin Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been lucky to work with some of the world’s best investors such as New York Times best-seller John Mauldin and Jared Dillian, a former ETF head of Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am a financial writer and active investor in stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The digital currency, the largest by market value, climbed to an intraday high of $39,262.10 this morning, according to <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a>. After rising to that level, the cryptocurrency fell back, declining below $38,500 and then rising toward $39,000, additional CoinDesk figures show. At the time of this writing, the digital asset was trading close to $38,500.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Following these latest developments, several analysts offered some perspective on bitcoin, including what key variables are affecting its price and where the cryptocurrency might go next.<strong>Financial Market Contagion</strong>Josh Olszewicz, head of research at <a aria-label=Valkyrie Investments class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://valkyrieinvest.com/ href=https://valkyrieinvest.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://valkyrieinvest.com/>Valkyrie Investments</a>, spoke to the situation, emphasizing the interconnectedness of markets. “Bitcoin continues to correlate strongly with traditional market indices, specifically the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq,” he said. “Legacy markets will likely need to settle down and stabilize before BTC has a strong recovery off of 2021 range lows,” added Olszewicz. Further, he mentioned the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, a measure of expected volatility in the S&amp;P 500. “The VIX also remains significantly elevated. Historically, spikes in the VIX have presented excellent longer term dip buying opportunities.”The market observer also leveraged the Relative Strength Index, a measure of whether an asset is overbought and oversold, which indicated that bitcoin prices may be headed for upside in the near future. “Bitcoin did hit a multi-month RSI low over the past few weeks, last seen during the March 2020 selloff,” Olszewicz noted. “Looking at RSI further, all lows in RSI to this degree since October 2018 have quickly mean-reverted to the 200-day EMA, currently at $48,000. Yearly pivot and VPVR resistance also show confluence for the $48,000 level.” Several other experts provided technical analysis, with Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider <a aria-label=Trade The Chain class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.tradethechain.com/ href=https://www.tradethechain.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.tradethechain.com/>Trade The Chain</a>, offering some insight. “Bitcoin seems to be trading in a ‘rising wedge’ formation, which typically ends bearish price action, but seems to be having an opposite effect - at least for now,” he stated.“If Bitcoin can firmly break the key resistance level of $39,000, it has a lot of room to run until the $41,000 level,” said Mancini.“From there, you would expect consolidation or possibly a reversal, which would likely test $39,000 as support before moving higher.” Collin Plume, CEO and founder of <a aria-label=My Digital Money class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/ href=https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/>My Digital Money</a>, also weighed in. “Bitcoin will go back to 40K and rest between $40k and $42k for a bit,” he said. “I think it will bounce around that region for a while before it tries to break the $50K. After that, we can expect new ceilings.” Analysts also spoke to crucial support levels that traders should monitor. “If Bitcoin is unable to break $39,000, it is likely destined to range between $37,000 and $39,000 before another break attempt, or it may trickle down to key support levels of $33,000 and $29,500,” said Mancini. Olszewicz also spoke to this matter. “Any lower lows are likely to find support in the $26,000 to $30,000 zone based on the mid-2021 range low, a multi-year pitchfork, the two-year moving average, and yearly pivot confluence,” he stated. “We also have a potentially still resolving head and shoulders chart pattern with a 1.618 fib extension to $25,000.” William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform <a aria-label=Token Metrics class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://tokenmetrics.com/ href=https://tokenmetrics.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://tokenmetrics.com/>Token Metrics</a>, also offered some perspective, pointing to the sentiment of market participants. “Bitcoin is underpinned by lingering bearishness from the last down move,” he stated. “In the near term, I think there could be a bullish surprise that catches people off guard.”Noble cited <a aria-label=Bob Farrell class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bob-farrells-10-thumb-rules-to-deal-with-market-uncertainties/articleshow/78841632.cms?from=mdr href=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bob-farrells-10-thumb-rules-to-deal-with-market-uncertainties/articleshow/78841632.cms?from=mdr rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bob-farrells-10-thumb-rules-to-deal-with-market-uncertainties/articleshow/78841632.cms?from=mdr>Bob Farrell</a>, a Merrill Lynch analyst, along with his famous words that when every expert is on the same page and believes something will happen, the exact opposite is usually what takes place. “In this case, people expect stocks and BTC lower, and the something else could be a fast recovery from the next dip and then a big rally,” Noble stated.<em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

The SEC <a aria-label=sent class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050446/000000000021014605/filename1.pdf href=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050446/000000000021014605/filename1.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050446/000000000021014605/filename1.pdf>sent</a> a letter to MicroStrategy in December saying it objected to the treatment and asking the firm to remove the adjustment in future filings. MicroStrategy, which has previously said“ it believes the inclusion of such losses may distract investors, said it would comply in a response two weeks later.MicroStrategy is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday. “Volatility in bitcoin shows that companies cannot rely on cryptocurrencies as sound corporate cash investments,” says Jerry Klein, the managing director of $19 billion advisory Treasury Partners. “Corporate investors get none of the sweets, but all of the indigestion by investing in bitcoin.” Accounting rules require corporations to treat bitcoin as an intangible asset, Klein says, meaning firms “must write down the value if the price declines, but they can’t write up the value if the price appreciates.” Tesla and billionaire Jack Dorsey-led Square have also reported accounting losses related to their bitcoin holdings.Thanks to its growing bitcoin investment—rivaled only by Tesla's 42,000 coins—MicroStrategy has minted a stunning turnaround since the dot-com bubble tanked its stock price roughly two decades ago.

However, prices have also been incredibly sensitive to the nascent crypto market's outsized volatility. Battered more recently by the SEC's growing scrutiny, the stock has crashed nearly 64% from a 21-year high in February 2020, when recently skyrocketing bitcoin prices plummeted after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter its prices seemed “a little high.”After peaking at nearly $3 trillion in value on November 10, the crypto market now sits at a total market capitalization of about $1.9 trillion, according to crypto data website CoinGecko.<a aria-label=SEC Objects To MicroStrategy Accurately Valuing Its Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Stash class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/01/31/sec-objects-to-microstrategy-accurately-valuing-its-billion-dollar-bitcoin-stash/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/01/31/sec-objects-to-microstrategy-accurately-valuing-its-billion-dollar-bitcoin-stash/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/01/31/sec-objects-to-microstrategy-accurately-valuing-its-billion-dollar-bitcoin-stash/>SEC Objects To MicroStrategy Accurately Valuing Its Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Stash</a><strong> </strong><em>(Forbes)</em><a aria-label=Bitcoin's Biggest Corporate Backer Announces $94 Million Investment Amid $250 Billion Crypto Market Crash class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/12/30/microstrategy-bitcoins-biggest-corporate-backer-announces-94-million-investment-amid-250-billion-crypto-market-crash/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/12/30/microstrategy-bitcoins-biggest-corporate-backer-announces-94-million-investment-amid-250-billion-crypto-market-crash/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/12/30/microstrategy-bitcoins-biggest-corporate-backer-announces-94-million-investment-amid-250-billion-crypto-market-crash/>Bitcoin's Biggest Corporate Backer Announces $94 Million Investment Amid $250 Billion Crypto Market Crash</a> <em>(Forbes)</em><a aria-label='Seized The Opportunity': Canada's Bitfarms Bought $43 Million In Bitcoin During $300 Billion Crypto Crash class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/01/10/bitcoin-miner-bitfarms-bought-43-million-in-bitcoin-during-300-billion-crypto-market-crash/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/01/10/bitcoin-miner-bitfarms-bought-43-million-in-bitcoin-during-300-billion-crypto-market-crash/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/01/10/bitcoin-miner-bitfarms-bought-43-million-in-bitcoin-during-300-billion-crypto-market-crash/>'Seized The Opportunity': Canada's Bitfarms Bought $43 Million In Bitcoin During $300 Billion Crypto Crash</a> <em>(Forbes)</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I'm a senior reporter at Forbes focusing on markets and finance.

Crypto is being used to take money out of countries that are regarded as unstable [by some external investors], said Tobias Adrian, the IMF’s financial counselor and head of its monetary and capital markets department. It is a big challenge for policymakers in some countries.Last week, the IMF urged El Salvador, which is seeking more than $1 billion in financing from the fund, to give up its bitcoin experiment, warning of the risks of bitcoin and stressing that it would negatively affect the country's ability to get a loan.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has bounced from its January lows but remains severely down on its high of almost <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

The IMF may be fearful of the rise of bitcoin’s increasing global presence, as other Latin American countries are rumored to be adopting bitcoin as legal tender themselves.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Jan 31 2022 05:40pm,"MIAMI, FLORIDA - JUNE 04: MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)MicroStrategy has been purchasing bitcoin since 2020 as a part of its capital allocation strategy. The company <a aria-label=holds over 120,000 BTC class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1476539985562152960?s=20&amp;t=MG-yZ0BB-g7-kGVuPydAKA href=https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1476539985562152960?s=20&amp;t=MG-yZ0BB-g7-kGVuPydAKA rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1476539985562152960?s=20&amp;t=MG-yZ0BB-g7-kGVuPydAKA>holds over 120,000 BTC</a> as of the end of December 2021. As a U.S. public company, MicroStrategy is required to report earnings and transactions related to bitcoin under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) standard. However, properly accounting for these transactions in GAAP financial statements is an emerging area. The current GAAP standards that classify digital assets as intangible assets with indefinite lives (similar to goodwill and trademarks of a business), fail to capture the true financial behavior of bitcoin holdings. This treatment requires companies to report a loss when digital assets' prices fall below the cost; however it prohibits marking up digital assets to it's true value when prices later recover. This discrepancy can negatively impact a company's net income, which could incorrectly translate into lower price per share. To address the shortcomings of GAAP earnings due to bitcoin impairment losses, MicroStrategy added a Non-GAAP Financial measures section to <a aria-label=Form 10-Q (Quarterly financial report public companies file with the SEC) for the quarter ended September 20, 2021 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-10-q_10-28-2021.pdf href=https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-10-q_10-28-2021.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-10-q_10-28-2021.pdf>Form 10-Q (Quarterly financial report public companies file with the SEC) for the quarter ended September 20, 2021</a>. However, the SEC objected to this new treatmentThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the IRS of the accounting world. The FASB is responsible for creating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). As of the date of posting, there are still no cryptocurrency specific GAAP rules.In the absence of these crypto specific rules set by the FASB, in 2020, a working group formed by the American Institute of <a aria-label=CPAs class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/how-to-find-the-best-tax-preparer-or-cpa/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/how-to-find-the-best-tax-preparer-or-cpa/ target=_self>CPAs</a> (AICPA) came up with a <a aria-label=Digital Asset Practitioner Guide class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/informationtechnology/downloadabledocuments/accounting-for-and-auditing-of-digital-assets.pdf href=https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/informationtechnology/downloadabledocuments/accounting-for-and-auditing-of-digital-assets.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/informationtechnology/downloadabledocuments/accounting-for-and-auditing-of-digital-assets.pdf>Digital Asset Practitioner Guide</a> addressing how to classify cryptocurrencies in GAAP financial statements.According to the white paper issued by the AICPA, crypto assets cannot be classified as “cash or cash equivalents” on GAAP financial statements because they are not backed by a sovereign government or considered legal tender. They cannot be classified as a financial instrument or a financial asset because they are not cash (see above why) and do not represent any contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument. Additionally, since cryptocurrencies are intangible, they do not clearly meet the definition of inventory and cannot be labeled as inventory on the balance sheet either.After going through the process of elimination, we are left with only one category to classify cryptocurrencies under: intangible assets with indefinite life. This is how MicroStrategy currently classifies bitcoin in their financial statements. <strong>(3) Digital Assets</strong>: The Company accounts for its digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. The Company’s digital assets are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, they are measured at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition (<a aria-label=10-Q, page 11 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-10-q_10-28-2021.pdf href=https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-10-q_10-28-2021.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-10-q_10-28-2021.pdf>10-Q, page 11</a>)There are a few problems with classifying cryptocurrencies as intangible assets with indefinite life. Practically speaking, this accounting treatment does not align with the reality. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are liquid and work extremely similar to cash. The purpose of GAAP financial statements is to paint an accurate, unbiased picture of the underlying entity’s financial situation. By treating crypto assets as intangible assets, GAAP financials fails to communicate the high liquidity of crypto assets. Second, once an item is classified as an indefinite life intangible asset, it should be tested for impairment. This means, if the value of the crypto asset has gone down at the end of the reporting period, the business gets to write off that amount as an impairment loss (not to be confused with tax losses) on the income statement. However, if the value goes back up (which is common due to high volatility), the business does <strong>NOT</strong> get to mark up the value of the asset. This overly conservative approach often results in businesses showing poor operating results under GAAP which negative affects investor sentiment and stock price. For example, MicroStrategy reported $65,165,000 of impairment losses for the three months ending September 30, 2021, because the market value of bitcoins went below their purchase price. Although this 65M impairment loss was not a cash outflow from the business, it was the largest operating expense which contributed to a net loss of $36,136,000.     Similarly, during the three months ending September 30, 2021, <a aria-label=Tesla class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021002253/tsla-20210930.htm href=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021002253/tsla-20210930.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021002253/tsla-20210930.htm>Tesla</a> reported 51M of impairment loss. <a aria-label=Square class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/SQ-3Q21-10Q.pdf href=https://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/SQ-3Q21-10Q.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/SQ-3Q21-10Q.pdf>Square</a> reported 6M of bitcoin impairment loss in the same period. MicroStrategy consolidated statement of operationsTo clarify the situation and show the true performance of the business to investors, MicroStrategy added a section named, Non-GAAP Financial Measures in their 10-Q. This section shows what would their operating income be without taking impairment and few other non-GAAP amounts (not related to digital assets) into consideration. According to this schedule, if impairment loss was not considered (and few other items not relevant to bitcoin), the company would have a net income of $18,566,000. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income scheduleThe SEC objected MicroStrategy’s Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income schedule above. On December 3, 2021, it sent the company a <a aria-label=comment letter class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050446/000000000021014605/filename1.pdf href=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050446/000000000021014605/filename1.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050446/000000000021014605/filename1.pdf>comment letter</a> and advised the company to remove it under the <a aria-label=Rule 100 of Regulation G. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8176.htm href=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8176.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8176.htm>Rule 100 of Regulation G.</a>Reg G requires public companies to disclose or release such non-GAAP financial measures to include, in that disclosure or release, a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation of the disclosed non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Although we don't know the specifics of the situation, it is clear that MicroStrategy’s 10-Q includes GAAP financials &amp; a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income schedule allowing readers to compare numbers easily. The company's goal is to clearly communicate the true operating performance of the company minus the paper bitcoin losses which is required to report under incompatible GAAP rules. Therefore, the specific concern the SEC has with the presentation is unclear. It is also interesting to see that the letter is only talking about the adjustment for bitcoin impairment charges among other items included in the Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income schedule such as share-based compensation, interest expense and income tax effects. On a subsequent <a aria-label=letter from MicroStrategy dated December 16, 2021 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001050446/000119312521359249/filename1.htm href=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001050446/000119312521359249/filename1.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001050446/000119312521359249/filename1.htm>letter from MicroStrategy dated December 16, 2021</a>, the company accepted SEC's comments and removed the adjustment for bitcoin impairment on the reconciliation of non-GAAP net income schedule. Finally, the rising inflation and the uncertainly of interest rates have moved the market sentiment from investing in risky companies to value stocks of profitable companies. Microstrategy may find it challenging to show a net profit under GAAP in the coming months if the price of BTC moves sideways in a bearish market or declines further creating more impairment losses. Even when BTC goes up, Microstrategy will not be able to show a profit under GAAP unless they sell it. This situation could unfairly affect the stock price of the company. If a spot BTC ETF gets approved, investors might be better off directly investing in the ETF compared to using Microstrategy as a way to get exposure to BTC.Keep an eye on how SEC approaches Non-GAAP disclosures related to bitcoin for other public companies holding bitcoin. ·      <a aria-label=Quick Guide To Filing Your 2021 Cryptocurrency &amp; NFT Taxes class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/01/24/quick-guide-to-filing-your-2021-cryptocurrency--nft-taxes/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/01/24/quick-guide-to-filing-your-2021-cryptocurrency--nft-taxes/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/01/24/quick-guide-to-filing-your-2021-cryptocurrency--nft-taxes/>Quick Guide To Filing Your 2021 Cryptocurrency &amp; NFT Taxes</a>·      <a aria-label=How The Infrastructure Bill Is Brewing A Crypto Tax Compliance Nightmare class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2021/11/30/how-the-infrastructure-bill-is-brewing-a-crypto-tax-compliance-nightmare/?sh=7245bc2669a9 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2021/11/30/how-the-infrastructure-bill-is-brewing-a-crypto-tax-compliance-nightmare/?sh=7245bc2669a9 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2021/11/30/how-the-infrastructure-bill-is-brewing-a-crypto-tax-compliance-nightmare/?sh=7245bc2669a9>How The Infrastructure Bill Is Brewing A Crypto Tax Compliance Nightmare</a>·      <a aria-label=How To Avoid Common NFT Tax Pitfalls. class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2021/10/28/how-to-avoid-common-nft-tax-pitfalls/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2021/10/28/how-to-avoid-common-nft-tax-pitfalls/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2021/10/28/how-to-avoid-common-nft-tax-pitfalls/>How To Avoid Common NFT Tax Pitfalls.</a><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description='&lt;p&gt;Shehan is the Head of Tax Strategy at &lt;a href=https://www.cointracker.io target=_blank class=color-link rel=nofollow noopener&gt;CoinTracker.io&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=https://www.cointracker.io/ target=_blank class=color-link rel=nofollow noopener&gt;bitcoin &amp;amp; crypto tax software&lt;/a&gt;).

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become an attractive alternative for people to improve their financial situation.Sports stars, politicians and other high-profile people have been requesting to take their compensation in digital assets. They point out that if you get paid in U.S. dollars, as inflation increases, the value of your paycheck decreases.  If you didn’t receive a hefty raise in 2021 and inflation remains the same or keeps raging higher, you’ll actually see a decrease in pay. This doesn’t mean the company pays you less, it's that the purchasing power from your salary doesn’t have the same value as it once did. It's like a race in which you are standing still and everyone is running past you. Each dollar you have is devalued and it takes more money to buy the same products compared to a year or so ago.It's possible to convert your salary into cryptocurrencies. It only takes a few steps. First, find out through the human resources department if their payroll system offers a cryptocurrency payment option. Then, decide the amount of money you’d like to be changed into digital assets. You may want to conduct due diligence into the various tokens before you select one. Setup an account with a digital wallet at a crypto exchange for your employer to send the funds to the platform. There may be fees and costs involved, so check into that as well.Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers previously <a aria-label=announced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/AaronRodgers12/status/1455256506601984002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1455256506601984002%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fsports%2Faaron-rodgers-bitcoin href=https://twitter.com/AaronRodgers12/status/1455256506601984002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1455256506601984002%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fsports%2Faaron-rodgers-bitcoin rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/AaronRodgers12/status/1455256506601984002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1455256506601984002%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fsports%2Faaron-rodgers-bitcoin>announced</a> that he wanted to receive his compensation in bitcoin, back in early November. At the time, the coin was more than $60,000—it's now trading at around $37,000.NFL star Odell Beckham Jr., wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams, signed a one-year deal with a base salary of $750,000 and bonuses that could bump it up to $4.25 million.

While the price of bitcoin has since somewhat rebounded, it hasn't fully recovered and remains extremely unpredictable. If the price doesn’t recover, he would still have to pay taxes on his income at the value of $750,000. This is something you need to keep in mind. If you are paid $100 and it drops to $50, the IRS doesn’t care about the loss and you’re taxed on the amount you were paid. Your accountant can help offer their guidance and advice on how to handle and report these wide fluctuations in value. Saquon Barkley, an New York Giants running back, <a aria-label=announced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/nfl-players-crypto-salaries-cryptos-022555475.html href=https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/nfl-players-crypto-salaries-cryptos-022555475.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/nfl-players-crypto-salaries-cryptos-022555475.html>announced</a> in July 2021 that he would place all of his endorsement earnings—totaling around $10 million—in bitcoin. He received his payments at the end of the year when bitcoin had not crashed as much as it has now. Since then, the market took a hit and unless he sold his positions, the odds are high that Barkley took a big hit. The <em>Washington Examiner </em>reported, “Barkley explained his goal is to attain wealth akin to Kevin Durant, Lebron James and Tom Brady, but said it's not attainable through just saving because of inflation.” He added, “You see inflation, you see how high it is right now and you learn that you can’t save yourself to wealth. That’s why I’m going to be taking my marketing money in Bitcoin.”Trevor Lawrence, the No. 1 draft pick in 2021 and the current quarterback for the Jacksonville Jaguars, <a aria-label=partnered class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/draft/2021/04/26/trevor-lawrence-jaguars-signing-bonus-cryptocurrency/7383149002/ href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/draft/2021/04/26/trevor-lawrence-jaguars-signing-bonus-cryptocurrency/7383149002/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/draft/2021/04/26/trevor-lawrence-jaguars-signing-bonus-cryptocurrency/7383149002/>partnered</a> with cryptocurrency app Blockfolio to announce that he’d place his approximate $24 million signing with the company. He’ll convert the cash into bitcoin, ethereum, solana and other digital assets, according to<em> USA Today</em>. Francis Suarez, the tech-savvy mayor of Miami, said in November that he would  accept his $97,000 all in bitcoin. Suarez foresees the possibility of building a tech hub in Miami. Leading by example, Suarez seeks to expand cryptocurrency use and acceptance in his city and entice tech talent and companies to South Florida. “For any city to survive and thrive, we need a knowledge-based economy,” he told <em>Bloomberg</em>. Suarez added, When governments are spending that kind of money that they are, when you have inflation at the point that it is, when you have rampant overspending in government and deficit spending, all of that pushes in favor of an increase in the price of Bitcoin. So, I feel very comfortable getting my entire salary in bitcoin.Eric Adams, the newly installed mayor of New York City, announced that he would take his first three paychecks in cryptocurrency. He converted his first biweekly paycheck into both bitcoin and ethereum. When asked on <em>CNBC</em> about losing money on the decision, he said, The purpose of the Bitcoin is to send a message that NYC is open to technology.Christophe De Beukelaer, a Brussels member of Parliament, followed the path of Suarez and Adams. De Beukelaer will convert his <a aria-label=entire salary to bitcoin class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://techunwrapped.com/bitcoin-this-mep-will-receive-his-salary-in-cryptocurrencies/ href=https://techunwrapped.com/bitcoin-this-mep-will-receive-his-salary-in-cryptocurrencies/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://techunwrapped.com/bitcoin-this-mep-will-receive-his-salary-in-cryptocurrencies/>entire salary to bitcoin</a>. He said about the decision, “Through this action, I want to demonstrate my confidence in a financial world in the making, a more transparent financial world, more accessible in the sense that it is decentralized. It is not run by a few people who decide to print more or less banknotes without any parliamentary control or debate.” He also wants Belgium to be forward looking and thinks the country shouldn’t “miss the train.”Investment professionals recommend a practice of “dollar cost averaging.” This means  instead of purchasing stock all at once, you buy shares on a regular set basis. Over time, you may buy at the high point, and other times when it's bottomed out. While it looks like the top athletes and politicians are sitting on losses, their fortunes could easily change if and when the crypto market turns around in their favor and the prices of bitcoin and other digital assets rise in value.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a CEO, founder, and executive recruiter at one of the oldest and largest global search firms in my area of expertise, and have personally placed thousands of professionals with top-tier companies over the last 20-plus years.

Biden maintains that regulating this fast-growing industry is so important that it's become a “<a aria-label=matter of national security class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454 href=https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454>matter of national security</a>.” It's an interesting point of time for this action, as the crypto market is going through a tumultuous time, losing large amounts of value for its investors.  Regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Internal Revenue Service and FINRA, will likely coordinate their investigations, audits and examinations. They’ll also review whether or not tokens should be considered and registered as securities. So far, the likelihood of regulation and the “recent crash in the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has not yet affected the rich total compensation packages offered by <a aria-label=cryptocurrency firms class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.teamblind.com/topics/Blockchain-Crypto href=https://www.teamblind.com/topics/Blockchain-Crypto rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.teamblind.com/topics/Blockchain-Crypto>cryptocurrency firms</a>, according to an analysis by the <a aria-label=professional social network class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.teamblind.com/ href=https://www.teamblind.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.teamblind.com/>professional social network</a> Blind.”The compensation is highly competitive at cryptocurrency exchanges.

These numbers are for engineers. The compensation for other professionals, managers and executives may escalate even higher: The demand for talent for bitcon, digital assets, NFTs and related platforms is blazing hot. A search on LinkedIn’s job site for “crypto” yields 15,433 results in the U.S. There were 4,656 listings for “bitcoin” jobs and 6,381 for “NFTs.” The site, unfortunately, doesn’t disclose the compensation on most of the job listings. Companies, in an effort to attract and recruit talent, are offering higher wages, <a aria-label=sign-on bonuses class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/09/08/companies-are-paying-100000-sign-on-bonuses-to-attract-workers/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/09/08/companies-are-paying-100000-sign-on-bonuses-to-attract-workers/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/09/08/companies-are-paying-100000-sign-on-bonuses-to-attract-workers/>sign-on bonuses</a>, remote, hybrid and <a aria-label=flexible workstyles class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/11/16/companies-that-truly-trust-their-employees-will-offer-them-flexibility-working-the-way-they-want/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/11/16/companies-that-truly-trust-their-employees-will-offer-them-flexibility-working-the-way-they-want/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/11/16/companies-that-truly-trust-their-employees-will-offer-them-flexibility-working-the-way-they-want/>flexible workstyles</a>, <a aria-label=one-on-one mentoring class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/12/30/offering-bespoke-one-on-one-mentoring-to-employees-helps-retain-workers/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/12/30/offering-bespoke-one-on-one-mentoring-to-employees-helps-retain-workers/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/12/30/offering-bespoke-one-on-one-mentoring-to-employees-helps-retain-workers/>one-on-one mentoring</a> and <a aria-label=free college tuition class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/12/29/in-a-competitive-job-market-free-company-paid-college-tuition-is-the-key-to-attracting-retaining-and-motivating-workers/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/12/29/in-a-competitive-job-market-free-company-paid-college-tuition-is-the-key-to-attracting-retaining-and-motivating-workers/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/12/29/in-a-competitive-job-market-free-company-paid-college-tuition-is-the-key-to-attracting-retaining-and-motivating-workers/>free college tuition</a>. There is another sweetener that some businesses are considering to attract people to join their firms—paying in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In 2021, we saw digital assets go parabolic. The number of new crypto projects and the incredible rise in value of the asset class caught America and the world’s attention. To some people, purchasing digital assets was viewed as a hedge against the U.S. dollar that’s being devalued, due to rising inflation and questionable policies from the federal government and Federal Reserve bank. Other folks, especially young people, saw cryptocurrencies as a YOLO (you-only-live-once) trade that could make them rich quickly. Burdened with heavy college tuition debt payments, exorbitant apartment and home prices, coupled with an alarming inflation rate raising the price of everything, digital assets seemed like the only way to get ahead financially.If you get paid in U.S. dollars, as inflation increases, the value of your paycheck decreases.

The consumer price index in September spiked 5.4% higher in 2021. The growth was so fast and furious that the U.S. government called for a nearly <a aria-label=6% cost-of-living increase for people on Social Security class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/social-security-cost-of-living-adjustment-will-be-5point9percent-in-2022.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/social-security-cost-of-living-adjustment-will-be-5point9percent-in-2022.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/social-security-cost-of-living-adjustment-will-be-5point9percent-in-2022.html>6% cost-of-living increase for people on Social Security</a>. This was the largest hike in four decades. Inflation has surged by 7%.We are seeing signs of change in payments.

There is a lot of volatility in this space.In 2021, the price of bitcoin hit $67,000 and subsequently plunged to under $30,000, and then bounced back again. Ethereum saw record highs of around $4,800 on December 1, only to see it trade lower at around $3,600 to $3,900. If you were paid in bitcoin, ethereum or other coins at a high point and then the price cratered, you will owe taxes based on the higher value you were paid.  For people who ardently believe in the future of crypto, are open to volatility and risk and have a long-term time horizon, payment in Bitcoin may be an exciting new way to enhance your wealth.Beckham signed a one-year deal with a base salary of $750,000 and bonuses that could bump it up to $4.25 million.

Mar 5 2022 02:18pm ,"What will President Biden say about Bitcoin and digital assets? It's hard to find his comments on <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> it. But next month, the market will know exactly what he thinks about it.</span>How real is the threat of regulatory overreach and higher taxation for Bitcoin? If powerful Western governments want to knock Bitcoin down a peg as it prepares to roll out digital versions of the dollar and euro, what’s to stop them from trying to punish it through stricter rules and higher taxes? This week might go down as one of the key markers in Bitcoin history. The <a aria-label=International Monetary Fund warned El Salvador class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/imf-urges-el-salvador-scale-back-bitcoin-push-82544006 href=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/imf-urges-el-salvador-scale-back-bitcoin-push-82544006 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/imf-urges-el-salvador-scale-back-bitcoin-push-82544006>International Monetary Fund warned El Salvador </a>to do away with its Bitcoin-as-legal-tender policy.

It’s one thing for the President of the United States to tell the public that new regulations are coming in its home market. But what’s this with the IMF telling a sovereign nation what to do with its currency policy? It’s not like El Salvador is borrowing money from the IMF in Bitcoin. The Powers-that-Be are anxious. They cannot roll out their central bank digital currencies fast enough. And decentralized crypto is gaining power.The UK’s former Health Minister, Matt Hancock, <a aria-label=wrote in an op-ed in City A.M. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cityam.com/uk-can-be-home-of-crypto-and-fintech-says-matt-hancock/ href=https://www.cityam.com/uk-can-be-home-of-crypto-and-fintech-says-matt-hancock/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cityam.com/uk-can-be-home-of-crypto-and-fintech-says-matt-hancock/>wrote in an op-ed in City A.M.</a> on Friday that, “the mainstream arrival of cryptocurrencies is set to shake the foundations of banking… the centuries-old idea you need a bank to make a payment is coming to an end.”Why a Health Minister is writing on this, I have no idea. But the likelihood is strong that this is water cooler chatter in London. A new banking model is taking shape. The old model wants its own digital currency to control. Bitcoin, others, are out of its control. For them, this can’t be good.Therefore, if you are of the mind that Central Banks want to kill Bitcoin (and all the alt-coins along with it), then how would they do that? I have been worried about central bank digital currencies eventually replacing demand and interest in Bitcoin. However, everyone I speak to about it is not as worried as I am. Now I have something knew I’m worrying about — a new risk, perhaps, for us crypto investors. If the U.S. or any government wanted to punish Bitcoin in favor of its own digital dollar, one way to go about it would be to increase taxation on crypto investments.Is such a thing even possible?Yes, it is.(Nod to <a aria-label=Ancient Aliens fans. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWihNBmupdI href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWihNBmupdI rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWihNBmupdI>Ancient Aliens fans.</a>)“What the administration would do is crack down on Coinbase and others and use regulations to make it so onerous for the exchanges, especially if Biden is going to call it a matter of national security,” speculates Vladimir Signorelli, founder of investment research firm Bretton Woods Research and a Bitcoin investor. “If they increased taxes, treated it differently, it would be unfortunate. It would be terrible.”<strong>Regulatory Whispers &amp; Taxation</strong>The White House is developing <a aria-label=a new digital securities strategy class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/white-house-is-set-to-put-itself-at-center-of-u-s-crypto-policy href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/white-house-is-set-to-put-itself-at-center-of-u-s-crypto-policy rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/white-house-is-set-to-put-itself-at-center-of-u-s-crypto-policy>a new digital securities strategy</a>, expected to be issued as an Executive Order (EO). This means it lasts only as long as Biden is in power, or a new president agrees with its premise. A finalized copy of the new rules is expected at some point in February. The EO will elaborate on a new regulatory framework and is expected to highlight how the White House views Bitcoin as a potential national security risk to the dollar.The International Business Times reported on January 24 that the EO will “direct federal agencies to weigh risks and opportunities of these <a aria-label=assets class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.ibtimes.com/metaverse-mania-demand-virtual-real-estate-will-increase-2022-analysis-says-3381147 href=https://www.ibtimes.com/metaverse-mania-demand-virtual-real-estate-will-increase-2022-analysis-says-3381147 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.ibtimes.com/metaverse-mania-demand-virtual-real-estate-will-increase-2022-analysis-says-3381147>assets</a> and submit their reports by the second half of the year.”So, none of this happens overnight. Investors will have time to think this over.“I think Biden will use an executive order to bring heavier taxes on Bitcoin,” says Dragostin Kozhuharov, owner of ComperBroker.io.Biden, himself, has said very little about Bitcoin. Or digital assets, in general.Meanwhile, the Fed issued its <a aria-label=report class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220120a.htm#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20Board%20on,and%20effective%20domestic%20payments%20system. href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220120a.htm#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20Board%20on,and%20effective%20domestic%20payments%20system. rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220120a.htm#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20Board%20on,and%20effective%20domestic%20payments%20system.>report</a> on their digital dollar — whereas the Fed becomes your bank if you opt-in to having a digital dollar wallet — and has invited public comments by May 20. Worth noting, the House of Lords in the U.K. shot down this idea of a digital pound two weeks ago. It’ll be back, eventually.Another issue that could pull the rug out from under Bitcoin in particular, and maybe even Ethereum in the short term, is the Biden team is concerned that mining for cryptocurrencies takes up too much electricity and is therefore bad for Mother Earth. Unlike printing dollars. That is not as bad for the planet.There are just too many ways the government can treat cryptocurrencies differently than traditional securities — and the best way to separate it from traditional assets is through taxation. Imagine punishing crypto investors with higher taxes? For sure, professional Wall Street firms will <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> hate this and will move their crypto offshore. But will that stop Washington from trying to tax it to death anyway?</span>For now, selling crypto is the same as selling a stock in your E-Trade account. Coinbase will have your tax documents ready for filing if you sold crypto for dollars. The Internal Revenue Service issued <a aria-label=Notice 2014-21 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf href=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf>Notice 2014-21</a> in 2014 that defined cryptocurrency as being the same as stocks, bonds, and other assets that qualify for <a aria-label=capital gains class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/capital-gains-tax/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/capital-gains-tax/ target=_self>capital gains</a> taxes. If your DeFi token is paying yield, apparently you get taxed on that, too, in theory. But I will save that for the tax specialists.Like a stock, if you bought $1,000 of <a aria-label=Ethereum class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.zenledger.io/blog/ethereum-price-prediction href=https://www.zenledger.io/blog/ethereum-price-prediction rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.zenledger.io/blog/ethereum-price-prediction>Ethereum</a> in August 2021 and sold it in October 2021 for $2,000, you earned $1,000 in short term capital gains and will be <a aria-label=taxed according to your tax bracket. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://smartasset.com/investing/short-term-capital-gains-tax href=https://smartasset.com/investing/short-term-capital-gains-tax rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://smartasset.com/investing/short-term-capital-gains-tax>taxed according to your tax bracket.</a>My evil genius thinking is that the government says — look, Bitcoin is harmful for the environment and it is not U.S. issued tender, therefore we can tax it differently.I don’t know how this would work. But it would trigger a massive sell off in Bitcoin. If you want to kill Bitcoin, get the most powerful nations in the world to tax it to death.I asked industry experts to calm me down.“Remember, Bitcoin is for ‘hodlers’. They don’t care about tax anyway,” says Kozhuharov. “People who have a lot of Bitcoin are holding for a really long time. Bringing taxes on Bitcoin isn’t going to influence the price,” he says.Bitcoin is down roughly 40% from its all time high.Igneus Terrenus, head of communications at Bybit says investors who hold “and do not realize their gains...there is no avenue to tax them.”Bitcoin has opened up the possibility of a new alternative financial system and economy. “Attempts to force this new reality into an outdated framework of top-down control is likely to fail,” says Ben Caselin, head of research &amp; strategy at AAX, a cryptocurrency exchange. “Nonetheless, following game theory, we can expect resistance to Bitcoin across the board, wherever it threatens the status quo,” Caselin says. “Draconian tax laws and other unreasonable measures to hamper its adoption would fit the picture and are both indicative of Bitcoin’s growth as well as the ignorance that surrounds it.”Ran Hammer, vice president of business development at Orbs, a public blockchain based in Singapore, says there are unknowns about the new regulations, and even some questions about existing ones, but higher taxes are unlikely.“Most of the regulatory issues on the table now won’t impact the tax approach,” says Hammer. “The live issues now have to do with how digital assets and products like trading platforms will be regulated, not taxed.”Besides, hitting crypto with taxes beyond what standard securities pay would also increase the likelihood for offshore crypto havens to flourish (مرحبا دبي!). It would also set up competition between countries. And while most Americans probably won’t unload their Coinbase account for the Russian version of one, Russia and others could make investing in crypto more attractive if the assets are held their instead. (Of course, the U.S. can, and would, just tax the hell out of it when you bring it home under Patriot Act laws, but if you are just transacting in BTC, you will never need fiat again.)“The U.S. knows the future is inevitably digital,” says Nigel Green, CEO of the deVere Group. “This would explain why Biden is rushing a directive that would place the White House in a central role overseeing plans to set policies and regulate digital assets.”Between Biden’s new crypto edicts in the works, the Fed’s digital dollar, and the IMF scolding tiny El Salvador for its Bitcoin policy, crypto is reaching a tipping power in the power play with fiat currency.“The IMF asking a pioneering sovereign nation to drop a future-focused financial policy that attempts to bring it out of financial instability and a reliance on another country’s currency shows the institution to be on the wrong side of history,” says Green. El Salvador <a aria-label=has used the dollar as its currency since 2001. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.irishtimes.com/news/el-salvador-adopts-us-dollar-as-its-currency-1.266688 href=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/el-salvador-adopts-us-dollar-as-its-currency-1.266688 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/el-salvador-adopts-us-dollar-as-its-currency-1.266688>has used the dollar as its currency since 2001. </a>“Bitcoin is the world’s largest digital currency –- and digital is the inevitable future of money. For the IMF not to recognize this is baffling,” says Green. “There’s a sense among them that Bitcoin is headed towards a moment of critical mass.”Correct. And if the Western banking powers, as demonstrated recently by the IMF, are against Bitcoin being the digital currency of choice, what’s the best way to stop it and make it all look quite reasonable to the talking heads of CNBC? My guess: tax the living daylights out of it, in favor of digital dollars and euros.<em>*The writer of this article owns Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I write about global business trends, big business dramas and investing, primarily in emerging markets.

Mar 6 2022 11:35am ,"While bitcoin and other coins aren’t yet considered securities, the regulators will dig into finding <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> out if there are instances of money laundering, pump-and-dump schemes, shady business practices, wash sales and market manipulations. This would be a complete game changer if Biden’s administration goes full throttle on this matter. </span>President Joe Biden is planning an executive action for federal agencies to regulate cryptocurrencies, digital assets and bitcoin, as he contends this is a matter of national security. He’s striking at a time when the crypto sector, along with the stock market, is going through a tumultuous time, losing large amounts of value, as the Federal Reserve said it will start raising interest rates to cool down inflation. His sights aren’t only on bitcoin. Regulators will look into stablecoins and NFTs. The Biden administration will also coordinate efforts with regulators and global leaders.Regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Internal Revenue Service and the self-regulation Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, will likely coordinate their investigations. They’ll also review whether or not tokens should be considered and registered as securities. Usually, when there is concern over a sector in the financial industry, the regulatory bodies conduct extensive, invasive examinations and audits. They’ll grill executives and key players of the platforms and brokerages that offer customers to buy, sell and trade securities. Trading activities will be highly scrutinized to search for any patterns of potentially illegal or unethical behavior.While bitcoin and other coins aren’t yet considered securities, the regulators will dig into finding out if there are instances of money laundering, pump-and-dump schemes, shady business practices, wash sales and market manipulations. This would be a complete game changer if Biden’s administration goes full throttle on this matter.  An underlying, unspoken reason for the seemingly sudden interest by Biden may be all the money that is sloshing around in the crypto space. Biden’s multitrillion-dollar infrastructure and other plans are creating a huge amount of debt for the country. The digital asset world is now too big to fail, but it's not too big to extract a lot of money from it.If the regulators find irregularities, substantial fines and tax levies may be extracted from everyone involved in the crypto ecosystem. The United States Treasury Department is already looking into what entities will be considered a crypto broker under the infrastructure bill Congress passed last year, and the reporting of any capital gains or losses to the IRS.Gary Gensler, the newly appointed chairman of the SEC, the premier regulator of financial services firms and Wall Street, has previously voiced his concerns over digital assets. Gensler took office when Wall Street had gone wild. During the pandemic, young, novice “investors” fell in love with meme stocks and aggressively traded on Robinhood. Cryptocurrencies became all the rage and a number of digital asset exchanges and platforms emerged to service the overwhelming demand for buying, selling and trading bitcoin, dogecoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. There was a boom in underwriting IPOs and SPACs. Questions arose over Chinese stocks listed and traded on U.S. exchanges and the practice of payment for order flow. Investors complained of activities that suspiciously looked like pump-and-dump schemes and attempts at market manipulations. Gensler shared his concern with CNBC, stating about the regulatory agency, “<a aria-label=We are short-staffed class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/sec-chair-gensler-says-regulator-is-short-staffed.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/sec-chair-gensler-says-regulator-is-short-staffed.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/sec-chair-gensler-says-regulator-is-short-staffed.html>We are short-staffed</a>.” He added, “It might sound odd to say that [about] an agency with 4,400 remarkable, dedicated staff working remotely during this challenging pandemic. But that’s 4% to 5% less than we had just five years ago.”   The lack of staffing and proliferation of new types of firms and products shouldn’t be too surprising to industry insiders. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, compliance and regulations were made a top priority. The carnage created during this period created the need for greater oversight of the securities markets, bankers, brokers and traders.Regulators cracked down on money laundering, insider trading, Ponzi schemes and other types of abusive and violative practices. The need for risk, audit, legal, compliance, privacy, regulatory and related professionals was insatiable. Compliance went from a sleepy back-office type of job into one of the hottest and fastest growing professions on Wall Street.  Things quickly changed when President Donald Trump took office. His administration made deregulation of the financial markets and Corporate America a top priority. Trump contended that with fewer rules and regulations, the “animal spirits” of companies will kick into gear. Companies, unencumbered by onerous regulatory burdens, would be set free to aggressively pursue bold business pursuits. Along with high taxes, regulations were viewed by Trump as an anathema to corporate growth and profits. He ordered that new rules will not be needed and existing ones should be scrutinized and thrown out, as he famously proclaimed, “For every new rule, two must be revoked.” Regulatory budgets were cut and regulatory personnel felt that they weren't appreciated or adequately supported. Many left to pursue other opportunities. Savvy Wall Street players noticed the shift in policy and we’ve now seen the results.  The SEC and other financial regulators, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Reserve Bank and FINRA, a self-regulatory organization, are likely to request and receive funding from President Joe Biden’s administration, especially as Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been outspoken with their dislike and distrust of Wall Street.It's reasonable to believe that there will be an aggressive hiring campaign at the SEC and other regulatory agencies. Strict examinations, audits and reviews of the securities and cryptocurrency industries will occur. To keep the banks and financial institutions safe and out of the crosshairs of the regulatory bodies, there may be a substantial increase in hiring of compliance, risk, audit, legal and regulatory professionals.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a CEO, founder, and executive recruiter at one of the oldest and largest global search firms in my area of expertise, and have personally placed thousands of professionals with top-tier companies over the last 20-plus years.

He also called for “additional congressional authorities to prevent transactions, products and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks to protect consumers.At the same time, <a aria-label=the Biden administration is drafting an executive order class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/24/biden-administration-to-release-executive-order-on-crypto-as-early-as-february-report/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/24/biden-administration-to-release-executive-order-on-crypto-as-early-as-february-report/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/24/biden-administration-to-release-executive-order-on-crypto-as-early-as-february-report/>the Biden administration is drafting an executive order</a> that will require virtually all federal agencies to assess the challenges, opportunities, and threats that cryptos present.<strong>Zooming out</strong>Regulators around the world seem to be gearing up to clamp down on cryptos in unison.<a aria-label=The Russian central bank has called for a blanket ban on domestic cryptocurrency trading and mining class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-central-bank-proposes-blanket-ban-on-crypto-mining-and-trading href=https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-central-bank-proposes-blanket-ban-on-crypto-mining-and-trading rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-central-bank-proposes-blanket-ban-on-crypto-mining-and-trading>The Russian central bank has called for a blanket ban on domestic cryptocurrency trading and mining</a>. Later, the head of the financial policy department at Russia's Ministry of Finance, Ivan Chebeskov pushed back saying, we need to regulate, not ban, adding that regulation is sufficient to protect our citizens, while banning cryptos would hinder “the industry´s technological development”. Elsewhere, Thailand has just announced plans to regulate the use of digital assets as a means of payment for goods and services “to avert potential impacts on the country's financial stability and economic system”, according to a joint press release from The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Ministry of Finance (MOF). However, Ms. Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, Secretary-General of the SEC,<strong> </strong>stressed that the SEC, as the regulator for digital asset business operators, wants “to promote the development of digital asset businesses,” and “places emphasis on utilizing digital assets to develop the country's economy and society”.A few countries have taken a more hardline stance. For example, this week Indonesia’s financial watchdog, the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, warned financial institutions in the country against offering or facilitating crypto-asset sales. Many Islamic institutions in the largely Muslim country have called for an outright ban on cryptos because their allegedly speculative nature is contrary to Islamic tenets.<strong>Looking ahead</strong>A period of rising interest rates to counter inflation appears to be underway. That historically has weighed down more speculatives areas of the market, including cryptos and equities. That said, interest rates are rising from very low levels. And given the debt mountain governments piled up during Covid, much higher rates aren’t sustainable, and could be reversed as inflation fizzles out.This is why regulatory developments around the world are likely to be a much bigger driver in the crypto market this year. <strong>Stay ahead of crypto trends with Meanwhile in Markets…</strong>Every day, I put out a story that explains what’s driving the crypto markets.<a aria-label=Subscribe here class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ href=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/> Subscribe here</a> to get my analysis and crypto picks in your inbox.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I have worked as an equity and macro analyst in a number of financial research houses including Mauldin Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been lucky to work with some of the world’s best investors such as New York Times best-seller John Mauldin and Jared Dillian, a former ETF head of Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am a financial writer and active investor in stocks and cryptocurrencies.

According to our estimates, the price of one bitcoin could exceed $1 million by 2030—a 2,500% increase from the bitcoin price now. The bitcoin price soared through much of 2021, helped on by El Salvador embracing the cryptocurrency and making it legal tender in September.Earlier this month, investment giant Fidelity said other countries and even a central bank could follow El Salvador into bitcoin this year—<a aria-label='predicting those that buy bitcoin while the price is low will be better off competitively than their peers.' class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/01/15/astonishing-an-investment-giant-just-advised-countries-and-central-banks-to-buy-bitcoin-while-the-price-is-low/?sh=2f7bcaed50dc href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/01/15/astonishing-an-investment-giant-just-advised-countries-and-central-banks-to-buy-bitcoin-while-the-price-is-low/?sh=2f7bcaed50dc target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/01/15/astonishing-an-investment-giant-just-advised-countries-and-central-banks-to-buy-bitcoin-while-the-price-is-low/?sh=2f7bcaed50dc>predicting those that buy bitcoin while the price is low will be better off competitively than their peers.</a>Last year, Cathie Wood—a long-time supporter of Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk—<a aria-label=made a bitcoin price prediction that the cryptocurrency would hit $500,000 by 2026 class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/19/tesla-and-elon-musk-devotee-cathie-wood-issued-a-serious-bitcoin-and-ethereum-fed-warning-but-held-her-500000-price-prediction/?sh=c18255b5a982 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/19/tesla-and-elon-musk-devotee-cathie-wood-issued-a-serious-bitcoin-and-ethereum-fed-warning-but-held-her-500000-price-prediction/?sh=c18255b5a982 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/19/tesla-and-elon-musk-devotee-cathie-wood-issued-a-serious-bitcoin-and-ethereum-fed-warning-but-held-her-500000-price-prediction/?sh=c18255b5a982>made a bitcoin price prediction that the cryptocurrency would hit $500,000 by 2026</a>.

Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies have been similarly volatile. </span>The ethereum price has leaped over the last year amid a surge of interest in blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—both largely built on top of ethereum's network. Ethereum could displace many traditional financial services, and its native token, ether, could compete as global money, wrote Elmandjra. As financial services move on-chain, decentralized networks are likely to take share from existing financial intermediaries. The beneficiaries of this shift include ethereum, the base protocol, and DeFi, the decentralized applications built on top of ethereum. As the preferred collateral in DeFi and the unit of account in NFT marketplaces, ether has the potential to capture a portion of the $123 trillion in global M2 [a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily-convertible near-money].We've become just as bullish on [ethereum], <a aria-label=Wood said last year class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/19/tesla-and-elon-musk-devotee-cathie-wood-issued-a-serious-bitcoin-and-ethereum-fed-warning-but-held-her-500000-price-prediction/?sh=c18255b5a982 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/19/tesla-and-elon-musk-devotee-cathie-wood-issued-a-serious-bitcoin-and-ethereum-fed-warning-but-held-her-500000-price-prediction/?sh=c18255b5a982 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/19/tesla-and-elon-musk-devotee-cathie-wood-issued-a-serious-bitcoin-and-ethereum-fed-warning-but-held-her-500000-price-prediction/?sh=c18255b5a982>Wood said last year</a>.

Jan 26 2022 11:05am,"Right before Bitcoin's high in November, Aaron Rodgers announced he was taking part of his salary in the digital coin.

Now, with his legacy under pressure following a losing run in this year’s NFL playoffs, the 2011 Super Bowl champion has more woes.Shortly after Rodgers proclaimed his love, the value of the digital coin peaked at more than $69,000. Since then, it has shared the same trajectory as his team’s postseason performance, falling below $38,000, a 39% decline from his announcement and a 45% drop from the peak.It’s unclear exactly how much of his $33.4 million in earnings <a aria-label=on and off the field class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2021/09/03/highest-paid-nfl-players-2021-two-star-quarterbacks-post-records-on-and-off-the-field/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2021/09/03/highest-paid-nfl-players-2021-two-star-quarterbacks-post-records-on-and-off-the-field/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2021/09/03/highest-paid-nfl-players-2021-two-star-quarterbacks-post-records-on-and-off-the-field/>on and off the field</a> this season are pegged to bitcoin, but he isn’t alone.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"In a press release today, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board (Board) concluded a 2021 ‘Article IV Consultation’ with El Salvador, where recommendations on the country’s economic policies are made. The Board was generally impressed with how the country managed the impact of Covid-19, although concern was expressed regarding the large public debt that grew during the pandemic. The Board was concerned about El Salvador’s banks recovering from exceptional liquidity measures and debt relief to individuals and businesses. The Board commended the country for choosing to move to a more forward-looking and risk-based financial supervision in the monitoring of its banks.

However, concern was expressed regarding the need for greater oversight and regulation for the new <em>Chivo</em> and Bitcoin ecosystem. Risks associated with Bitcoin that were highlighted included financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection. While El Salvador was praised for its work to help improve financial inclusion, the Board did urge that the scope of the law remove Bitcoin’s legal tender status in the country. However, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has been very resolute in his belief of the benefits of Bitcoin for his country.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> cryptocurrency investors in Santa Maria Mizata, El Salvador, Saturday, Nov. 20, 2021.</span>Some Directors on the IMF Board were also concerned with the use of Bitcoin-backed bonds as well. Samson Mow, the Chief Strategy Officer of the digital asset firm Blockstream, announced earlier this year how his company was overseeing the implementation of the billion-dollar ‘Volcano bonds’. Half of the money raised would be used to purchase Bitcoin mining equipment while the other half would be used to buy Bitcoin. The Chivo Wallet webpage that El Salvador uses for its distribution of Bitcoin explains the technology as , “...a virtual currency created in 2009 that serves to purchase products and services like any other currency. But it is decentralized, that is, there is no authority that is responsible for its issuance and control. Everything is recorded in a decentralized database distributed worldwide.” President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador responds to the IMF report suggesting that Bitcoin be removed <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> as legal tender in his country. </span>Key benefits of Bitcoin listed by El Salvador’s digital wallet include its use as a global currency that will open the country to international markets, ability to save in remittances by removal of intermediaries so Salvadorans could save millions of dollars in transferring money to their families, and as a foreign investment since investors could spend their Bitcoin in El Salvador, which can improve the country’s economy.

Mar 5 2022 01:06pm ,"The fortunes of the wealthiest Bitcoin, XRP and other crypto investors and entrepreneurs have imploded along with the value of digital assets. The worst may not be over.  Bitcoin has fallen nearly 50% since it's record high in November.Ten of the wealthiest cryptocurrency moguls tracked by <em>Forbes </em>have lost a combined $26.9 billion since November 10, 2021, when Bitcoin and the overall crypto market peaked in value, according to <em>Forbes’ </em>calculations. Three of the ten are worth 50% less than in early November–a staggering loss even for the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market value, has tumbled 50% since it reached an all-time high of $68,622 on November 10, according to data provider CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency was trading at $34,326 at midday Monday–the price Forbes used to calculate current holdings. (Six hours later, Bitcoin bounced up to $36,000.) Other cryptocurrencies have followed suit. Ether, the second largest digital asset, has also halved in value since November. Stocks correlated to cryptocurrencies have fallen, too. Since Bitcoin’s peak, shares of crypto exchange Coinbase Global have dropped 42%, falling from $328 per share to just $191 as of market close on January 24. As a result, Coinbase’s two billionaire cofounders–CEO Brian Armstrong and board member Fred Ehrsam–have lost over $7 billion in wealth between them.MicroStrategy, a software firm that invested over $3 billion of its corporate treasury into bitcoin, is down 55% since November 10. (By comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen about 15% over that same time period.) Michael Saylor, a Bitcoin investor and MicroStrategy’s CEO, has seen his fortune plunge 55%. Few digital assets have performed well. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies was nearly $3 trillion on November 10. That number was $1.7 trillion as of noon eastern time on January 24, representing a 43% plunge in less than three months. Unfortunately for crypto investors, the market rout may not yet be finished. Many analysts believe the sector is entering a bear market as central bank tightening and rising bond yields dampen investor appetite for cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments. It’s not all bad news for crypto’s tycoons: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’s crypto exchange Gemini upped its valuation to over $7 billion in late November, before Bitcoin really tumbled, which protected their net worths somewhat—at least for now. Others remain optimistic: Tim Draper, the billionaire investor who dropped $18.7 million on nearly 30,000 bitcoins in 2014, told <em>Forbes </em>last week that he believes Bitcoin will manage to surge over 600% this year to $250,000, despite the bearish conditions. “As the interest rate worries drive the markets down,” Draper added, “I suspect some of the marginal cryptocurrencies will disappear, and more effort and concentration will be applied to Bitcoin and the other important coins.” Of course, he has a reason to predict a rosy future for Bitcoin, since he owns so much of it.Here is how the net worth of these ten crypto billionaires has changed, from November 10, 2021, to January 24, 2022. .Valuations were calculated using close-of-market stock prices, and crypto asset prices as of noon eastern time on both days.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a New York-based journalist covering billionaires and wealth at Forbes.

The positions regulators take often aren’t applied in ways that seem consistent or equitable.The extreme volatility on crypto markets, with both bitcoin and ethereum bouncing along with stock markets this week after a huge crypto crash, has piled pressure on regulators to act in order to protect investors.

It appreciated to this point after dropping to as little as $32,983.59 this morning, additional CoinDesk data reveals. The digital currency has been having a rough several months, losing more than 50% of its value since approaching $69,000 last year. Bitcoin declined over the weekend, and then the digital currency extended those losses today, causing it to reach its lowest since July 23. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]<strong>Key Role Of Policy</strong>When explaining these latest price movements, more than one analyst pointed to the anticipation of tighter Federal Reserve policy and increasingly stringent crypto regulations.In December, the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it would <a aria-label=reduce class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211215a.htm href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211215a.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211215a.htm>reduce</a> its monthly asset purchases, starting in January.

In the past, these government entities have taken a disorganized approach to regulating the crypto and blockchain space, failing to provide industry participants with a clear set of rules. Charlie Silver, CEO &amp; Chairman of <a aria-label=Permission.io class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://permission.io/ href=https://permission.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://permission.io/>Permission.io</a>, spoke to this situation, stating that “The anticipation of Fed and White House moves, unfortunately, weigh heavily on the market.”Mark Elenowitz, president of FinTech firm <a aria-label=Horizon class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.horizonfintex.com/ href=https://www.horizonfintex.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.horizonfintex.com/>Horizon</a>, also weighed in. He stated that today’s sell-off was the “result of expected rate increases by the Federal Reserve and uncertainty of regulation around the space in certain countries.” Elenowitz described it as “having a major impact not just on crypto but equities in general.” “A lot of the selling appears to have already happened, which suggests that the markets are already pricing in expected tightening by central bankers.”<strong>Key Technical Levels</strong>After outlining these major drivers of bitcoin’s latest price movements, several market observers shed some light on crucial levels of support and resistance.Multiple technical analysts identified support close to $30,000. Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at <a aria-label=StockCharts.com class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://stockcharts.com/ href=https://stockcharts.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://stockcharts.com/>StockCharts.com</a>, spoke to “the major support level near 30k,” describing it as “a very important support level as it represents the cluster of lows that was set in the summer of 2021.”Elenowitz also chimed in, stating that “It looks as though the price for support for Bitcoin is around $31,000 or so.” John Iadeluca, founder &amp; CEO of multi-strategy fund <a aria-label=Banz Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.banz.capital/ href=https://www.banz.capital/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.banz.capital/>Banz Capital</a>, offered his point of view on the matter. “There’s a substantial support level that has newly formed at $33,000 alongside a large amount of buying pressure that has culminated throughout the course of today’s market,” he stated. The analyst next outlined the digital currency’s key resistance. “The next level of resistance seems to have formed, from a high-level perspective, at $40,000, with a smaller, but more precise sell-wall having established new resistance at the $37,500 price level.” De Kempenaer also weighed in. “There is a bit of resistance around 37.5k and more importantly around 40k, the old support level,” he stated. “Watching 30k like a hawk, it will have major implications either as a trigger for even more acceleration lower in case it breaks or as the floor for the market to stabilize if it holds,” said de Kempenaer. “Either way it will take time before BTC will enter a clear uptrend again.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 6 2022 11:35am ,"(Photo by BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP via Getty Images)In March 2020, the stock market plunged. The black swan Covid-19 outbreak created fear and uncertainty. Investors sold first and asked questions later. They anticipated the worst and desperately wanted to get out of stocks—afraid of losing all or a big chunk of their money.Parallel to the precipitous decline in the stock market, companies furloughed and fired millions of Americans. Executives were concerned over how bad things could become and wanted to lighten their expenses by jettisoning workers. Since the March 2020 lows, the stock market rebounded like a rocket, going straight up. Those who remained invested saw giant gains. We also witnessed something new. People stuck at home, due to being laid off or colleges being closed and going to an online format, started trading meme stocks, options, NFTs, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The Federal Reserve, to keep the economy afloat, printed money nonstop. The United States government spent trillions of dollars to stimulate the economy. This unprecedented amount of money sloshing around drove up the prices of stocks and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as food and home prices. Historically, stock and real estate prices can’t go up forever without a correction. The balloon keeps expanding until it's either pricked, letting the air out slowly, or gets so extended it bursts. Supply chain disruptions causing higher prices, the trillions put into the economy, higher wages and other factors led to inflation. This created rapidly rising prices. In an “everything-goes-up” world, there’s a big risk of it ending badly. Political and social tension, a potential war between Russia and the Ukraine that could possibly bring in other countries, tense relations with China and the Federal Reserve Bank stating that it won't be as accommodating any longer and will raise interest rates stoked fear in the markets.The confluence of events created a fear-induced selling frenzy. Novice investors, not used to stocks going down, sold their holdings. People who trade on margin were forced to sell to pay off the margin requirements. People who’ve made fortunes over the last couple of years took their winnings off the table. Google searches for “is the market crashing?” and “why is the market crashing?” were trending.The NASDAQ index, a gauge of technology stocks, fell over 10% from its record high. This drop is referred to as a “correction,” taking some froth out of the market. The S&amp;P 500 index, a bellwether for the overall economy, lost around 5.7% last week and more than two-thirds of the companies in the index shed 10% of their value since recording their record highs, with 1,490 stocks declining 20% or more from the highs. <a aria-label=Bloomberg class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/bezos-loses-20-billion-in-brutal-week-for-tech-billionaires href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/bezos-loses-20-billion-in-brutal-week-for-tech-billionaires rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/bezos-loses-20-billion-in-brutal-week-for-tech-billionaires><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/bezos-loses-20-billion-in-brutal-week-for-tech-billionaires>Bloomberg</em></a> reported, “Changpeng Zhao of Binance lost $17.7 billion, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta lost $10.4 billion, Bill Gates of Microsoft saw a $9.5 billion drop in his fortune and Jeff Bezos' wealth of Amazon decreased by $20 billion. In total, the five richest tech tycoons lost $85 billion [due the sell off last week].” Their losses continued into Monday. CEOs and corporate executives don’t like the unknown. They want clarity and certainty. If the selling continues, and there is a real or perceived fear of a war in Eastern Europe, along with high inflation and supply chain disruptions, it's logical that management will hold back on hiring. In addition to hiring freezes, businesses may start firing people to preemptively cut costs. They’ve done it before, so it wouldn’t be surprising if they return to their old playbook.People who were contemplating looking for a new job may decide to hold off and wait. They won’t want to be the last one in at the company and first one out and let go. If stocks fall further into a “bear market,” going down 20% or more, the fear could snowball into more layoffs, as panic may take hold.Hopefully, this is only a much-needed, rational correction that pumps the brakes on rampant speculation. Sobriety will take hold and people may hold off on purchasing NFTs, stocks and digital assets, believing someone else will buy it back from them at a higher price tag. Long term, this may take out some of the excesses, cooling down the temperature and then we’ll enter a more reasoned phase. When that happens, the executives will feel more comfortable and start hiring once again.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a CEO, founder, and executive recruiter at one of the oldest and largest global search firms in my area of expertise, and have personally placed thousands of professionals with top-tier companies over the last 20-plus years.

Mar 5 2022 02:18pm ,"Say no to Bitcoin?(Photo by MARVIN RECINOS / AFP) (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images)Several Wall Street pundits have speculated that Bitcoin could hit a price of $100,000 this year. Some predicted that last year, but that’s a moot point now. I am not in the $100,000 camp. While I do believe in the future of the blockchain, when it comes to the tokens that have captured the imagination of a generation of investors, I do what I always do: I look at the charts. And when I do, I see reward potential (because any investment can go up at any time), but much greater risk that the current rout will not only continue, but be one of breathtaking proportions. I see a greater chance of Bitcoin hitting $10,000 this year than $100,000. Here’s how I break it down.Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, have fallen on hard times. As the stock market declares war against “risk-on” investments (those which are popular because of future hopes, not fundamental realities), Bitcoin has been dragged down with them.That’s a sign that cryptocurrency is not some kind of alternate currency or life preserver for investors. It is more like a commodity. Its price is determined by supply and demand. But demand is dropping. And that leaves crypto extremely vulnerable, in the way that dot-com stocks were vulnerable in the year 2000. Here’s what Bitcoin has going for it right now:Here is a chart of Bitcoin’s price since it spiked from under $10,000 over $68,000 during the financial markets’ recovery from the initial pandemic shock in 2020.Bitcoin and crypto at a pivotal pointNow, here’s what Bitcoin has stacked against it as we enter late January:So, I don’t see Bitcoin at $100,000 any time soon. I do see potential for a “round-trip” back to the level from which the current mania started. That level? <strong>Around $10,000. That’s another 70% down from here. That’s not so much a prediction, but a projection..</strong>.if the “buy-the-dip” mentality that has ruled the crypto climate fails to re-boot itself soon, the combination of forced sales by leveraged investors, panic by inexperienced market participants, and the other risks highlighted above could make this a cruel year for crypto investors.So, if you are crypto investor, it’s a good time to take account the role it plays in your overall investment picture. This article cannot be a source for the many, many techniques you can use to manage risk, hedge, diversify, etc. Just know that there are many. But at the end of the day, every investor that has counted on Bitcoin and/or its cousin-coins to lead them to quick, massive wealth needs to re-think that plan. The “easy money” era in crypto is likely over.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I spent the first decade of my career on Wall Street.

Mar 6 2022 09:02am ,"bitcoinYou could say that bitcoin crashes a lot and that it booms frequently, too. If you consider a 25% fall in value a crash, which in equity it is, then crypto does crash frequently.A real crash for a booming financial instrument, however, is 70%-85%, which in scale puts a normal established market to shame, and a bubble market crash that is just 50% can be considered mild.To me a “real” bitcoin crash is 75% and I’ve been expecting one since the beginning of last year. This expectation was well on its way when unexpectedly, at least for me, it reversed.For market cycles to repeat, the underlying trading psychology has to remain constant and in the case of bitcoin and crypto’s second rally later in 2021, the advent of the China social clampdown and the Afghanistan crisis injected new life into crypto and spun it up to all-time high levels. To me that has just meant a delay in the pullback to this cycle’s bitcoin’s lows.I don’t like to predict with prophetic certainty, preferring to show both sides of the argument and say which side I’m on. I’ve been a bear since the initial highs and very skeptical since bitcoin cleared $30,000, preferring to trade DeFi from there on until the $60,000s. It’s all here on Forbes so you can read me trimming and tacking over the last few years.Right now I find it hard to see a bull trend for the bull case anywhere and the bear case is obvious.Here are some charts I contemplate:The prediction I made for bitcoin last monthThis chart is a projection from before Christmas and is playing out:My bitcoin prediction from before ChristmasYes, this is my own brand of voodoo gibberish, but not a bad “lucky chartist nonsense guess” a month out.At the same time, this was another map of where the direction of travel might take us:Another of my bitcoin predictionsWe are nearly on the first level of potential trend low but I think we won’t stop there. So right now this is what anyone who gives charts a moments credence will be looking at:The current bitcoin chartThe bullish hope is that bitcoin will pop off this level and ride on up. I still see the bottom at or under $20,000. Frankly I see the bottom at above and around $12,000 but I do not hold such predictions as anything but fragile estimates.To me bitcoin under $20,000 is the place to start dollar cost averaging. If I’m wrong and there is no next leg down for the market, the game to play is in with the junior cryptos, the Polygons and Avalanches etc., because they will pop much more.In my hypothesis, the crypto euphoria is dead and next comes the panic. This will not be the end of crypto, far from it, it will just be the low of this cycle and a great opportunity and one with a long period to embrace it and load up for the next multiplying event.The last crash went from $20,000 to $3,000 and off up to $69,000, so there is no reason bitcoin can’t pull back to $15,000 and go on to hit $100,000 or $200,000. You might say, that is what crypto does.Most people should dollar cost average through the whole cycle and some will and they have stronger nerves than me. I prefer to buy when it’s low and sell when it’s high, rather than do the opposite, which so many people get trapped by.That low is coming (unless some such disaster as Russia invading Ukraine kicks off) and then after some months of languishing when there will be nothing but skeptics gloating, up will go crypto on its way again on another wild ride.It’s what crypto does.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description='&lt;p&gt;I am the CEO of stocks and investment website &lt;a href=www.advfn.com rel=nofollow noopener&gt; ADVFN &lt;/a&gt;.

published on Friday.<strong>Treasure trove: </strong>The investigation is based on interviews with dozens of former employees of Binance, advisers and business partners, as well as hundreds of leaked internal documents. The report claims Binance has refused to answer regulators and partners' questions about its operations and turned down German police requests to help track down fraudsters and terrorists.<strong>Risk alert: </strong>In 2020, Binance acted against its own money laundering risk alerts for at least seven countries, according to Reuters. Specifically, the ratings for Russia and Ukraine were manually downgraded from extreme to high, such that the exchange could continue offering services there.<strong>On the run: </strong>Binance, which is famous for its controversial corporate structure that eschews a traditional headquarters, has received multiple warnings about its operations from regulators around the world about its activities, including Germany, the U.K., Singapore, Japan, and the Cayman Islands. The investigation details how Binance has twice fled markets once its relationship with regulators soured, in Japan and Malta.<strong>CZ pushes back: </strong>FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt], <a aria-label=tweeted class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202201241215:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/1a280630?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDMwMjY2ODAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxZWU5OGE1MGU1OTI0MTY3MDI1MTI0MiIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvdHdpdHRlci5jb21cL2N6X2JpbmFuY2VcL3N0YXR1c1wvMTQ4NDU1Njc3Njc3MTMyNTk1Nz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=T2LL6SsX1w8VgqY-6TxbWAjZy4i5UrZXFHPMbPrlHaA href=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202201241215:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/1a280630?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDMwMjY2ODAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxZWU5OGE1MGU1OTI0MTY3MDI1MTI0MiIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvdHdpdHRlci5jb21cL2N6X2JpbmFuY2VcL3N0YXR1c1wvMTQ4NDU1Njc3Njc3MTMyNTk1Nz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=T2LL6SsX1w8VgqY-6TxbWAjZy4i5UrZXFHPMbPrlHaA target=_self title=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202201241215:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/1a280630?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDMwMjY2ODAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxZWU5OGE1MGU1OTI0MTY3MDI1MTI0MiIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvdHdpdHRlci5jb21cL2N6X2JpbmFuY2VcL3N0YXR1c1wvMTQ4NDU1Njc3Njc3MTMyNTk1Nz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=T2LL6SsX1w8VgqY-6TxbWAjZy4i5UrZXFHPMbPrlHaA>tweeted</a> Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao after the investigation was published. Journalists talking to people who were let go from Binance and partners that didn’t work out trying to smear us. We are focused on anti-money laundering, transparent and welcome regulation. Action speaks louder than words. Thank you for your unwavering support!<strong>Binance pushes back:</strong> Responding to the many claims, a Binance spokesperson said in a statement to <em>Reuters</em>: As the leading cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, we are both leading and investing in the future technologies and legislation that will set the crypto industry on the road to becoming a well-regulated, secure industry. The spokesperson, without going into details, said <em>Reuters</em>’ information was wildly outdated and—in several places—flatly incorrect.

We think it is not too much of a stretch to imagine bitcoin falling below $30,000 this year.Over the last year, bitcoin and ethereum rivals such as BNB, solana, cardano and even the meme-based dogecoin have made huge gains, climbing thousands of percent as investors bet the cryptocurrencies could see far wider adoption and form the basis of a new, decentralized internet. The combined crypto market peaked at around $3 trillion in November, up from under $500 billion a year earlier. Jackson warned the huge bitcoin and crypto price rises over the last year could be seen as a financial mania and lead to steep losses as the market returns to normality. A loss of 45% is experienced in the 12 months after the peak of a typical financial mania, Jackson wrote. Meanwhile, analysts at investment bank UBS have <a aria-label=warned class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-crypto-winter-crash-slump-interest-rates-regulation-ubs-2022-1?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets href=https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-crypto-winter-crash-slump-interest-rates-regulation-ubs-2022-1?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-crypto-winter-crash-slump-interest-rates-regulation-ubs-2022-1?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets>warned</a> the looming prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and the end of pandemic-era stimulus measures could plunge cryptocurrencies into a crypto winter bear market as happened in 2018. UBS also expects regulatory crackdowns on bitcoin and other high-flying cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, BNB, solana, and cardano. This week, Russia's central bank said it wanted the country to follow China in issuing a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining—using high-powered computers to secure blockchain networks in exchange for new coins. Russia's central bank said the rapid growth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been caused by speculative demand and that cryptocurrencies carry characteristics of a pyramid scheme, warning of potential price bubbles in the market.Wild speculation on cryptocurrencies inevitably invites closer oversight to guard consumers [and] protect financial stability, the UBS analysts, led by James Malcolm, wrote in a note to clients. High-flying stablecoins and [decentralized finance] projects seem almost sure to face bigger setbacks from authorities in the coming months.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has lost almost 30% of its value over the last week with declines among smaller <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> coins like ethereum, BNB, solana, cardano and XRP even more severe. </span>However, some bitcoin and crypto market watchers aren't too worried about Russia's potential crypto ban, pointing to Russia-based miners' far smaller contribution to bitcoin's network, known as the hashrate. Russia imposing a blanket ban on bitcoin mining may well have an impact on its hashrate and price in the short term, Simon Peters, analyst at trading platform eToro, said via email. However, I don’t believe this will be a long-term headwind. Russia is only responsible for approximately 11% of the global hashrate. This is in stark comparison to China, which when it banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, the mining operations based there accounted for 60–70% of the global hashrate of the bitcoin network. When these China-based miners went offline due to the ban, the hashrate dropped significantly along with the price. But, as those miners set up in other countries and jurisdictions the hashrate rebounded and is now at an all-time high.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Helping you understand the world of bitcoin and crypto, every weekday</strong>The bitcoin price has crashed to under $39,000, dragging down the price of major cryptocurrencies <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> ethereum, BNB, solana, cardano and XRP. </span>Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has dropped under the closely-watched $3,000 per ether level, as ethereum's biggest rivals BNB, solana and cardano have all moved sharply lower after making huge gains over the last year.The crypto price crash has now seen around $1.2 trillion wiped from the combined crypto market after it hit an all-time high of $3 trillion in November. The bitcoin price is down almost 50% from its peak of nearly $70,000 per bitcoin. Investor nerves have been frayed in recent months by the looming prospect the unprecedented pandemic-era stimulus from the Fed and other central banks could soon be wound down. Earlier this month, markets were spooked by the news Fed officials had floated the idea of shrinking the bank's balance sheet alongside its expected interest rate rises. The Fed is being forced to act sooner and more severely than the market had expected by soaring inflation that has already seen prices accelerate at a pace not seen for decades.As crypto prices struggle, cryptocurrency funds recorded a fifth consecutive week of outflows last week, according to a report from digital asset manager CoinShares. It found total outflows over this period for the whole crypto market reached to $532 million, the sharpest outflows since 2018. I think the main reason for this is the market being spooked by the Federal Reserve raising rates this year, but when the stock market sees some relief, I expect a strong squeeze to the upside for bitcoin and the whole market, Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in a note ahead of the latest crypto price crash.

The report, authored by the Fed's seven-member board of governors, found a digital dollar could fundamentally change the banking system and its relationship with the Federal Reserve, with a digital dollar able to serve as a near-perfect substitute for commercial bank money.Meanwhile, the sudden crypto price crash comes shortly after reports Russia is set to follow China in banning bitcoin and crypto, warning that crypto assets are a threat to the country's financial stability, its citizens' wellbeing and its monetary policy sovereignty. China's comprehensive crypto ban last year saw the country expel those who use high-powered computers to secure blockchains in return for new coins and sent bitcoin and crypto prices spiraling. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has crashed from a peak of almost $70,000 per bitcoin in November, with the <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Importantly, the ban will also outlaw any crypto mining activities. As this would negatively affect bitcoin’s hashrate, some investors may be wondering whether the ban, when enforced, could result in more selling pressure on the price of this asset.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Mar 5 2022 08:21am ,"Crypto energy usage can be lowered from its current enormous levels, House panel toldThe energy used in cryptocurrency transactions is enormous, but it needn’t be, a Congressional hearing today was told.“The energy required to validate just one Ethereum transaction could power a U.S. home for more than a week, the energy required for a Bitcoin transaction could power a home for more than 70 days House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-NJ) asserted in a memorandum for the session of the committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.He noted at the same time, the environmental costs were high with a single Ethereum transaction adding more than 90 pounds of CO2 to the atmosphere, while a single Bitcoin transaction added more than 1,000 pounds.Estimates put Ethereum and Bitcoin mining operations together responsible for emitting more than 78 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, equal to the annual tailpipe emissions of more than 15.5 million cars.As further evidence of the environmental toll, the Energy and Commerce Committee Chair said one cryptomining company acquired two shuttered waste coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania to generate more than 150 megawatts to support mining operations.Even with the high amount of money they’re spending for energy, Pallone said miners are making more money now than ever before given the increase in the value of the cryptocurrencies and there are concerns that as long as the dollar value ofProof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrency mining rewards exceed the costs of deploying, powering, and cooling mining facilities, their required energy consumption and environmental impact may grow further.Proof of Work, according to Investopedia, uses a competitive validation method to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.However, energy consumption can be slashed, he noted.One way he pointed to is with Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains: “Despite some setbacks and opposition from miners, Ethereum is moving forward with a transition to PoS, called Ethereum 2.0, which may use 99.99 percent less energy than a Proof of Work blockchain.In Proof of Stake, Investopedia says cryptocurrency validators share the task of validating transactions.John Belizaire, chief executive officer of Soluna Computing, a developer of green data centers for cryptocurrency mining, asserted during the session computing-intensive process commonly used now in mining is not a waste:“The energy used to perform the computation provides irrefutable proof that a participant earned the right to validate a new block, add it to the chain, and earn a reward. The entire system is designed to encourage participants to protect the network rather than attack it.”Brian Brooks, chief executive officer of Bitfury Group, a company that provides a suite of infrastructure products and services for Bitcoin mining, said as well the requirement of energy expenditure in proof-of-work blockchains such as the Bitcoin blockchain enhances the security of the relevant networks:“This is because the expense involved in taking over 51 percent of the network’s computing power – the threshold necessary to rewrite blocks of transactions on the blockchain – would be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked and no bitcoin have ever been counterfeited.”Trying to lower the level of worry over cryptomining energy usage, Brooks, a former acting Comptroller of the Currency, said it comes approximately the same amount of electricity per year as gold mining without the environmental damage from solid waste production through tailings and waste rock, open cut mining, chemical consumption, and pollutant emissions that gold mining poses. Concerns about energy usage will likely be alleviated as the technologies for both blockchain and energy production advance, predicted Gregory Zerzan, a private attorney who once served as counsel to the Energy and Commerce Committee.He warned the concern about the technology threatens to drive innovation and opportunity in this area to foreign markets, including the opportunity cryptocurrencies give smaller investors to reap large rewards.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am bringing you perspectives on financial regulation from the rare vantage point of experience.

It's more likely to accelerate towards $100,000,” McGlone said in a recent interview with <a aria-label=Cointelegraph class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUm-T8OVw0Q href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUm-T8OVw0Q rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUm-T8OVw0Q>Cointelegraph</a>.McGlone’s bullish call rests on a “unique phase” bitcoin is undergoing. The analyst argues bitcoin is rapidly transforming from a speculative asset into a store of value, which will differentiate its price action from the rest of the crypto market.“Bitcoin is in a unique phase, I think, of transitioning from a risk-on to risk-off global digital store of value, replacing gold and becoming global collateral. So I think that's going to be happening this year,” <a aria-label=said McGlone class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-transition-to-a-risk-off-asset-will-propel-it-to-100k-in-2022-says-bloomberg-analyst href=https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-transition-to-a-risk-off-asset-will-propel-it-to-100k-in-2022-says-bloomberg-analyst rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-transition-to-a-risk-off-asset-will-propel-it-to-100k-in-2022-says-bloomberg-analyst>said McGlone</a>. <strong>Zooming out</strong>Bitcoin dethroning gold as its digital successor has been one of the biggest narratives driving its price in the past two years. The analogy is not that far-fetched. <a aria-label=As I wrote last year: class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/01/07/bitcoin-could-soon-hit-70000-and-that-has-nothing-do-with-currencies/?sh=71e9b7c12910 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/01/07/bitcoin-could-soon-hit-70000-and-that-has-nothing-do-with-currencies/?sh=71e9b7c12910 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/01/07/bitcoin-could-soon-hit-70000-and-that-has-nothing-do-with-currencies/?sh=71e9b7c12910>As I wrote last year:</a>“From an investment and ideological standpoint, bitcoin is actually more like a commodity. More precisely, one of the most expensive and “useless” commodities in the world—gold. Unlike other commodities like oil, gold has limited use. Gold is not a medium of exchange either. You can’t walk into Pizza Hut, drop a sliver of gold on the counter, and get a slice of pizza. At most, you’ll get some strange looks.And yet, central banks hold 34,000 tons of the shiny, yellow bullion bars in their reserves. Institutional and individual investors have sunk ~$2.7 trillion into gold. And every year, gold holdings keep growing and growing. That’s because gold has just one job, and it does it very well. That is, sit tight in a vault and hold its value.”In fact, back then I estimated that if just 20% of <em>private</em> gold investments (that’s excluding central bank reserves) moved to bitcoin, bitcoin’s market cap would double to $1.3 trillion:“Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope math real quick. As I write this, there’s $650 billion worth of Bitcoin out there. Meanwhile, investors hold at least $2.7 trillion in gold, according to World Gold Council. If, say, they moved just a bit more than 20% of their gold holdings to Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency could double or more.”<strong>Looking ahead</strong>As 2022 is set to deliver the biggest hawkish monetary reversals in the past decade, bitcoin will finally answer the most important question: after 13 years, is it still a speculative asset? Or has it worn off on investors as a safe haven?This question is going to be one of the most fundamental bitcoin drivers in the near term. If Mike McGlone is right, there’s a good chance bitcoin is bound for price ranges that are way past last July highs.<strong>Stay ahead of crypto trends with </strong><a aria-label=Meanwhile in Markets… class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ href=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/>Meanwhile in Markets…</strong></a>Every day, I put out a story that explains what’s driving the crypto markets.<a aria-label=Subscribe here class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ href=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://meanwhileinmarkets.com/> Subscribe here</a> to get my analysis and crypto picks in your inbox.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I have worked as an equity and macro analyst in a number of financial research houses including Mauldin Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been lucky to work with some of the world’s best investors such as New York Times best-seller John Mauldin and Jared Dillian, a former ETF head of Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am a financial writer and active investor in stocks and cryptocurrencies.

Bellweather crypto, Bitcoin, has seen prices plummet by almost 10% year-to-date, to levels of about $43,000 currently, and also remains down by almost 33% from all-time highs seen in November 2021. The decline is likely driven by expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy as the Federal Reserve plans multiple rate hikes for this year, as inflation soars to near 40-year highs. Moreover, the recent uncertainty following the surge in Covid-19 cases (U.S. daily cases averaged over 800,000 last week), amid the spread of the highly infectious omicron coronavirus variant, is also adding to the negative sentiment.Our theme of <a aria-label=Cryptocurrency Stocks class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/g1dbV0JI/Compare-Crypto-Stocks-Performance-AMD-PYPL-OSTK-MSTR-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118 href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/g1dbV0JI/Compare-Crypto-Stocks-Performance-AMD-PYPL-OSTK-MSTR-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/g1dbV0JI/Compare-Crypto-Stocks-Performance-AMD-PYPL-OSTK-MSTR-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/g1dbV0JI/Compare-Crypto-Stocks-Performance-AMD-PYPL-OSTK-MSTR-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118>Cryptocurrency Stocks</strong></a> which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies, enables investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain without betting on the volatile cryptocurrencies themselves.

The bellwether crypto has rallied from lows of under $30,000 in July. There are likely a couple of factors driving the recent gains. Firstly, there has been some anticipation that a Bitcoin futures ETF could be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shortly. Moreover, the chairman of the Federal Reserve clarified that he has no intention to ban cryptocurrencies in the U.S, easing concerns in the market following China’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency.

Are These Crypto Stocks Better Picks?</strong>Bitcoin prices have declined by almost 7% since Friday, to levels of around $42,000 a unit although it recovered a bit over the weekend. The cryptocurrency also remains down by about 11% over the past month. The recent volatility comes as China’s central bank announced that all cryptocurrency transactions in the country were illegal. While a ban on crypto trading came into effect in China in 2019, it apparently continued via offshore exchanges. With the latest developments, crypto trading of all forms is likely to be shut down in China, and this likely caused liquidation of cryptos, putting pressure on prices.While China’s crypto crackdown is a setback, it probably doesn’t change the course for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies, which have the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies of our time.

While prices for the bellwether cryptocurrency more than doubled to levels of around $65,000 between early January and mid-April 2021, driven by higher institutional interest, prices fell back to levels of just under $30,000 as of mid-July, due to China’s crackdown on Bitcoin trading and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s increasingly hawkish stance. However, the currency has recovered swiftly from the recent lows, rising by about 65% since July 20th, and trades at about $50,000 currently. The recent recovery is apparently driven by factors including short-covering, as well as signs that the U.S. SEC was increasingly open to allowing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Investors who want to play the long-term gains in cryptos, without exposing themselves to the volatility and boom and bust cycles in cryptocurrency pricing, should take a look at our indicative theme on <a aria-label=Cryptocurrency Stocks class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/ZpugxEVa/Crypto-Stocks-To-Invest-In-S-NVDA-PYPL-AMD-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118 href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/ZpugxEVa/Crypto-Stocks-To-Invest-In-S-NVDA-PYPL-AMD-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/ZpugxEVa/Crypto-Stocks-To-Invest-In-S-NVDA-PYPL-AMD-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/THEMES/no-login-required/ZpugxEVa/Crypto-Stocks-To-Invest-In-S-NVDA-PYPL-AMD-CME?fromforbesandarticle=trefis220118>Cryptocurrency Stocks</strong></a> which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"As cryptoassets continue to become increasingly mainstream, and become integrated into both daily payments and financial instruments, the following questions needs to be asked; just what exactly is the future of the space? Bitcoin and other crypto were designed, developed, and launched as a mechanism to create a parallel financial system that would enable peer-to-peer payments without the need for intermediaries. The reality of the situation, however, is quite different at least as far as bitcoin is concerned; bitcoin has been surpassed by stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for transactional purposes. Getty The point of view and perspective that bitcoin is an investment rather than a currency or transactional tool might be an unpopular one in some circles, but is one that is virtually undeniable. As new applications and iterations of cryptoassets have emerged in the marketplace, the dominance and leadership of bitcoin continues to challenged via the numerous crypto applications running on the Ethereum blockchain. All of that said, there are several trends and use cases for bitcoin and other cryptoassets that are worth noting, and are playing a critical role in how these instruments are – more and more – becoming part of mainstream financial conversation. <strong>Bitcoin bonds are here.</strong> The coming issuance of a $1 billion bond collateralized and supported by bitcoin by El Salvador is a clear sign that bitcoin (and other crypto) are continuing to permeate the fixed income space. Although the bond has yet to be issued, and there are several factors that might complicate the issuance, payments, and retirement of this instrument, the fact that such instruments even exist is a clear sign of how mainstream these assets have become. The global debt market is much larger and actually more interconnected than the equity market, although equities typically receive more headlines and discussion. Even with the approval of the first ever bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), the potential for bitcoin and crypto bonds is a significant story for both nations and corporations. The fact that the proceeds from this bond are going to assist with the construction of the world’s first crypto city is icing on this proverbial cake. <strong>Bividends</strong>. Just within the last several weeks the first ever dividend denominated in bitcoin - “bividends” - have been issued and paid out to stockholders of BTCS, Inc. Dividends, clearly, have long been a part of the financial markets conversation, but have always been paid in either fiat currency or equity shares. The paying of dividends in the form of bitcoin is noteworthy for several reasons, namely 1) it is the first time such an event has happened, and 2) it further reinforces the role of bitcoin as an institutional asset class. It remains to be seen how widespread this practice will become, or if organizations such as Tesla

</fbs-ticker> – just two examples of organizations that have embraced bitcoin – will follow this trend. Regardless, the fact that bitcoin is now able to be paid out in the form of dividends represents a significant step forward further integrating bitcoin into public financial markets. <strong>Taxes</strong>. As cryptoassets and crypto transactions continue to become increasingly mainstream, and enabled by large international payment processors, the current state of crypto tax policy is worth a second look. Under current guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), anytime a cryptoasset is involved in a transaction, exchange, or trade there is a tax reporting obligation and potentially a tax liability. As bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more integrated into financial transactions this is an issue and matter that needs to be addressed. Simply put, cryptocurrencies will never achieve their potential if every time a cryptoassets is involved in a transactions there is a tax obligation. That said, it is encouraging that the regulatory conversation is seeming to evolve and mature; no longer are cryptoassets universally treated as mechanisms for illegal transactions. Tax policies, and the accounting rules that accompany the tax treatment of financial instruments, are a multi-faceted and complicated conversation that requires input from numerous stakeholders. The fact that bitcoin and other crypto are being utilized by major payment processors should hopefully lead to more favorable tax treatment going forward. Cryptoassets are a fast moving and rapidly evolving asset class, but as quickly as the sector has matured and expanded, there are several significant developments that are worth of a second look. While the original idea of blockchain and cryptoassets might have been to construct a separate and parallel financial system, crypto is – more and more – an aspect of the fiat based financial ecosystem. Even as these developments continue, and crypto is utilized by nations and countries the world over, it is worth noting that it is still early days; crypto has a long and promising journey laid out before it, and financial markets have an important role to play in this process.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a professor at the City University of New York – Lehman College.

I'm just going to see if there is anything new, Cuban, the owner of the NBA team the Dallas Mavericks and celebrity investor who's recently launched an NFT website, says via email, pouring cold water on expectations he'll make a big announcement. I don't expect any fireworks.Cuban has clashed with some in the bitcoin and crypto community in recent years, famously saying a few years ago he'd rather have bananas than bitcoin. However, Cuban, who owns a handful of pricey NFTs, has embraced both decentralized finance (DeFi), which wants to recreate traditional financial services using crypto technology instead of banks, and collectible NFTs, increasingly being used by sports teams and gaming companies as a new revenue stream.

NFT marketplace OpenSea has generated nearly $2.7 billion in volume so far this year, mostly fueled by a price surge in wildly popular Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, and is on track to surpass the $3.4 billion high it reached in August, according to data from Dune Analytics.Other big names at the North American Bitcoin Conference include the billionaire founder of blockchain technology company Bloq, Matthew Roszak, Peter Smith, the chief executive of Blockchain.com, and Craig Sellars, one of the co-founders of controversial stablecoin Tether.Miami mayor Francis Suarez, who'll also be speaking at the event, has said he wants to make the city the first in America to give a bitcoin yield as a dividend directly to its residents and hopes to one day run the city without taxes.We’re excited to see what industry-disrupting techs launch this year, North American Bitcoin Conference organizer Moe Levin in a statement.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has fallen sharply over the last month, dropping to lows not seen since September <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has surged over the last year as the popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi)—using crypto technology to recreate traditional financial services—and viral, digital media-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have soared—both of which are almost entirely based on ethereum's blockchain. Web3, the idea a blockchain and crypto-based internet will replace the Silicon Valley-centric web 2.0, has been popularized in recent months by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg pivoting his social media giant towards the metaverse and huge venture capital investment from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz. Rivals to ethereum—Binance's BNB, solana, and cardano—have attracted billions of dollars over the last couple of years as traders bet they'll be able to win market share from ethereum, which is plagued by sky-high fees and painfully slow transaction times.Solana prioritizes scalability, but a relatively less decentralized and secure blockchain has trade-offs, illustrated by several network performance issues since inception, wrote Shah. Solana has suffered a number of outages in recent months that have cast doubt on the blockchain-based network's ability to scale. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The solana price has surged 4,000% over the last year, climbing at a far faster clip than the price <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"(Photo by ABDUAZIZ MADYAROV/AFP via Getty Images)The fact that we are in the grip of a global energy crisis is now beyond doubt. In the UK there are a slew of energy businesses going into administration, and pleas for government bailouts for energy intensive manufacturers. In the domestic economy, there are spiralling numbers of old people who, having survived Covid-19, are forecast to perish unless the winter is exceptionally mild.In recent months, France has seen some of its fastest growing green energy suppliers lose customers at a rapid rate, as the green premium looks increasingly unaffordable. Hydroption, a supplier of low carbon electricity, has been placed under judicial administration after failing to pay its suppliers and debts.India has suffered too, with shortages of coal in the second half of 2021 leading to outages and curbs imposed on energy hungry industries. In China, companies in the industrial heartlands have been told to limit consumption, and residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts with annual light shows being cancelled.At the root of this is the price of gas, with the last six months seeing its value shoot from 60 to 352 pounds per therm.(Photo by BBC/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58090533)Perhaps it was only a matter of time before the price of energy and power outages created social unrest and rioting. Last week, fuel price pressure erupted as riots in Kazakhstan. The government there has told its military it can shoot protesters on site, without warning. These are deeply worrying times for anyone in the region.But the Kazakhstani rioting has another dimension to it - its involvement in cryptocurrency. When China shut down its Bitcoin manufacturing in May 2021, most of the work went to the U.S. and Kazakhstan which could offer cheap energy. Within just two years, Kazakhstan’s market share of Bitcoin production went from 1.4 per cent in September 2019 to 18.1 per cent in August 2021. The international energy agency estimates that Kazakhstan’s emissions per energy unit are a third higher than China’s used to be (at about 1,500g of CO2 a kilowatt hour).https://www.statista.com/chart/25969/bitcoin-mining-hashrate-share-of-computer-energy-by-country/Although the official cause of the riots was the removal of the cap on LPG prices for cars, it’s thought dissatisfaction and resentment in the country goes far deeper and includes internal struggles. (Photo credit should read VYACHESLAV OSELEDKO/AFP via Getty Images)It’s also possible that the large increase in the production of Bitcoin contributed to the stress on fuel and grid shut downs, which exacerbated matters. Certainly the government was happy to scapegoat crypto miners for the electrical power outages. The notion of cross-sector competition for resources isn’t fanciful. Many people think the global rice crisis of 2008 was caused by petrochemical companies buying land for growing aviation biofuel, and so jet engines were suddenly competing with human beings for their energy needs.The authorities in Kazakhstan switched off the internet and the Bitcoin production for a few days before normal service resumed.As Vitalik Buterin, the computer scientist who invented Ethereum, an alternative cryptocurrency to Bitcoin observed, “There are real consumers – real people – whose need for electricity is being displaced by this stuff.”The global consumption of electricity for Bitcoin is around 100 terawatts of power, equivalent to the gross consumption of countries like Ireland or Argentina. The bitcoin miners, like miners from every century before them, aren't too bothered about the environment, emissions, smog, slag heaps or carbon footprints. Their job is to find the cheapest sources of electricity around in whatever countries they happen to reside.The less carbon tax, the better, because for them the maxim is: I have the computer equipment and I am willing to travel.For anyone hoping for a greener world energy market there’s a certain incongruence here. Many countries around the world are looking to tax, control and clean up their energy usage.  And then somewhere else in the world, a long way from controlling authorities like the EU, the U.S. or China, there is a state where a massive amount of coal is burned in the service of Bitcoin. That state is a moving feast, like an international version of a pop up speakeasy in prohibition America.What does all this tell us?Firstly Bitcoin is predicated on energy, just like currencies that were based on gold. There were always people who said it was based on hype, but for Bitcoin the relationship with energy is clear.Secondly, there will always be a part of the world that doesn’t want to play the CO2 tax and control game.Bitcoin is establishing itself not only as a currency that expresses freedom from centralised bank controls, but also as the currency that expresses its freedom from energy and CO2 controls too.But for the users of Bitcoin, like Tesla

</fbs-ticker>, who want to demonstrate that they’re not sponsoring the renegades and destroyers of the environment, there is a solution.It’s already very possible to create a distinction between green Bitcoin and brown Bitcoin.There is much Bitcoin that has been minted with hydropower and clean energy. And there is even more that is the product of dirty lignite based coal, the type of which you would find in Kazakhstan, with its aging coal plants.Distinguishing between these two forms of Bitcoin isn’t difficult, just like differentiating between an environmentally friendly washing soap and an environmentally destructive one.If we want to educate a consumer to expect the better version, the technology exists. It's Bitcoin’s own blockchain, of course, which will keep a record of the green, grey and brown level of any Bitcoin that has been mined.Whether there is enough political will and consumer appetite to put this into practice is another matter.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;Dr Jemma Green is cofounder and chairman of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.powerledger.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;www.powerledger.io&lt;/a&gt;, software that uses blockchain for energy and environmental commodity trading.

There's a lot more money going into it in the venture capital world. There are a lot of people who are skeptics, who are, now, at least, trying it out.In December, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire founder of trading platform Interactive Brokers who once warned bitcoin futures could destabilize the real economy, <a aria-label='flipped and said investors should buy a small amount of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin or ethereum in case the dollar goes to hell.' class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/01/04/why-a-billionaire-bitcoin-and-ethereum-skeptic-suddenly-just-flipped-and-made-a-wild-crypto-price-prediction/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/01/04/why-a-billionaire-bitcoin-and-ethereum-skeptic-suddenly-just-flipped-and-made-a-wild-crypto-price-prediction/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/01/04/why-a-billionaire-bitcoin-and-ethereum-skeptic-suddenly-just-flipped-and-made-a-wild-crypto-price-prediction/>flipped and said investors should buy a small amount of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin or ethereum in case the dollar goes to hell.</a>Fears over soaring inflation, which has hit a near-40 year high in the U.S., have led to investors buying bitcoin to hedge against dollar depreciation. Miller, who built his reputation as a fund manager by outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index for 15 years straight through the 1990s and into the 2000s, said that apart from his bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments, the rest of his personal portfolio is in Amazon stock, calling himself probably the largest individual shareholder of Amazon whose last name isn't Bezos.It comes down to the very basic level of supply and demand, Miller told <em>WealthTrack</em>, declaring himself now a bitcoin bull rather than just a bitcoin observer. Bitcoin is the only economic entity where the supply is unaffected by the demand, he said pointing to bitcoin's block reward paid out to miners who secure the bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin's hard cap of 21 million coins. Miller revealed he began buying bitcoin in 2014, when its price was a mere $200 per bitcoin, and then bought a little bit more overtime after it climbed to $500. He then sat on the sidelines until bitcoin crashed back to $30,000 last year, dropping around 50% from highs of around $66,000 in April.This time I started buying it again at $30,000, down from $66,000, said Miller, adding that he bought a fair amount in the $30,000 range.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has come off its lows but remains far from the near $70,000 per bitcoin it hit in <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Since then the bitcoin price has lost 40% of its value, along with ethereum and most other major cryptocurrencies, as investors fret over the possibility the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates and begin shrinking its bloated balance sheet.Despite his faith in bitcoin, Miller advised average investors not to put more than 1% of their portfolio into bitcoin, saying that even if it goes to zero, which I think is highly improbable, but of course possible, you can always afford to lose 1%.I think the average investor should ask himself or herself, what do you have in your portfolio that has that kind of track record—number one, is very, very under-penetrated; can provide a service of insurance against financial catastrophe that no one else can provide and can go up 10 times or 50 times?

But investors in cryptocurrency and NFTs do not currently get the kind of information reporting forms that holders of publicly traded securities receive. The lack of routine and uniform information reporting makes it extremely costly and time consuming for taxpayers to prepare their federal income tax returns and report virtual currency or digital asset transactions.

Because cryptocurrency is treated as property, but is not eligible for <a aria-label=1031 Like-Kind Exchange Treatment class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/fs-08-18.pdf href=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/fs-08-18.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/fs-08-18.pdf>1031 Like-Kind Exchange Treatment</a>, exchanging one type of cryptocurrency for another is a taxable transaction. And keeping track of information required to accurately calculate and report the tax consequence of such transactions has historically been extremely cumbersome and difficult, both from a labor intensive and cost point of view.With the passage of the <a aria-label=Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text href=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text>Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> (Public Law 117-58), cryptocurrency will be defined as a security and subject to increased information reporting requirements by “brokers,” which will now include “[a]ny person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.” Put differently, once the new law takes effect in December of 2023, all digital asset brokers, exchanges, or sellers will be required to provide information reporting forms for digital asset transactions, including cryptocurrency and NFTs. <strong>A New Approach - TaxBit Network </strong>TaxBit’s network will revolutionize tax return preparation for digital asset investors and users <strong>now<em>, </em></strong>and just in time for 2021 filing season. It will offer every user of a supported TaxBit Network company the option to receive a free 2021 tax information form, including <a aria-label=IRS Form 8949 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8949 href=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8949 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8949>IRS Form 8949</a>, which is required to report property exchanges, sales, and dispositions, as well as forms that will provide an income report. According to TaxBit, “In tandem with the launch of TaxBit Network, many participating platforms will be incorporating a one-click, free TaxBit sign up within their native applications to further simplify access to 2021 tax forms and year-round access to TaxBit’s industry-leading software.”TaxBit CEO Austin Woodward, who is a Certified Public Accountant, created TaxBit together with his brother <a aria-label=Justin Woodward class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/profile/justin-woodward/?sh=7d76f1b06502 href=https://www.forbes.com/profile/justin-woodward/?sh=7d76f1b06502 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/profile/justin-woodward/?sh=7d76f1b06502>Justin Woodward</a>, who is a tax attorney. Austin Woodward describes the TaxBit Network as similar to a health insurance network that will provide services free of charge to the end-users (customers) who use the in-network providers. In fact, the TaxBit “network” <em>will </em>operate much like a health insurance network. In-network exchanges will now include a feature that allows clients to press a button and produce the tax information reporting form associated with all of the transactions in that account, free of charge. TaxBit’s computation and tax form preparation services can still be used for years prior to 2021 and for out-of-network exchanges or private wallets, but taxpayers will have to pay a fee for those services. The TaxBit Network includes well-known cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a aria-label=Coinbase class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coinbase.com/ href=https://www.coinbase.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coinbase.com/>Coinbase</a> and is growing every day. “With the recent passing of the cryptocurrency tax provision in the Infrastructure Bill, proactively providing our users with the tax reporting and forms they need is an important step in our commitment to safety and compliance. Binance.US is excited to make the tax reporting process simple and free to our users through the TaxBit Network, Brian Shroder, CEO of Binance.US, said in a statement.“TaxBit solves a critical challenge for our clients, cryptocurrency investors and digital asset companies, through increasing consumer confidence, which is a win for the industry at all levels, said <a aria-label=Thomas Kane class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-kane-b8701050/ href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-kane-b8701050/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-kane-b8701050/>Thomas Kane</a>, CEO of Kane Capital Group. “Cryptocurrency investors of all magnitudes will be provided an element of standardization for the tax reporting process where there is not a clear precedent. These types of services are essential to retail and institutional investors as U.S. lawmakers determine how to best implement a regulatory framework for this industry.” The IRS has made no secret that it is<a aria-label=aggressively pursuing taxpayers class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/irswatch/2020/05/29/got-cryptocurrency--get-ready-for-an-irs-audit/?sh=325f4e5e1231 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/irswatch/2020/05/29/got-cryptocurrency--get-ready-for-an-irs-audit/?sh=325f4e5e1231 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/irswatch/2020/05/29/got-cryptocurrency--get-ready-for-an-irs-audit/?sh=325f4e5e1231> aggressively pursuing taxpayers</a> who engaged in cryptocurrency transactions and failed to accurately report and pay tax on those transactions. Moreover, the IRS has confirmed that it is not considering a global voluntary disclosure program specifically designed for taxpayers who engaged in digital asset transactions but failed to disclose them. “We expect compliance with the rules to properly report activities involving any property or currency to include virtual currency. While the technology can be complex, the taxation is much simpler: spending or disposing of virtual currency is generally a taxable event. At the end of the day, when you sell or trade something for more than you paid for it, you can expect to trigger a tax,” according to the IRS. Indeed, not only is the technology complex, but so too is maintaining the relevant information needed to calculate and report federal income taxes based on those complex transactions. The unlimited wallet and unlimited transaction product that TaxBit is offering for free will certainly make it easier for taxpayers to correctly prepare and file their taxes for 2021 and 2022, ahead of the new reporting required by the Infrastructure Bill. <strong>What about Private Wallets? Yes, the IRS can see you. </strong>As a tax controversy attorney, I often hear from people who think that crypto held in a private wallet is just that - private. And these same people think that they can disclose crypto held on a public exchange, such as Coinbase, without having to disclose the existence of a private wallet. This is a <strong><u>terrible</u></strong> idea. First, the simple act of disclosing part of the story is far worse from a criminal tax perspective then just about any other course of action possible. The taxpayer demonstrates an understanding of what is required, but only does <em>some</em> of what is required. This is textbook criminal tax evasion.  Second, just because something is in a private wallet does not mean that the IRS cannot see it. Indeed, according to the IRS, “[i]t’s certainly feasible to track virtual currency as it enters an address, even when the address is held in a private wallet. Then, when the wallet owner `spends’ virtual currency by engaging in a transaction, the tracing process can resume and follow the progression of transactions, either backward or forward along the blockchain, to obtain both the history of transactions leading to the private wallet and the disposition of virtual currency when it leaves the wallet. The phrase we live by at the IRS, ‘Follow the money,’ works as well in the virtual currency world as it does in the fiat one. It’s just that in IRS parlance, we now think of ‘Following the property,’ as virtual currency is defined by IRS.”When asked about whether the IRS can trace funds held in a private wallet, the IRS responded affirmatively, “IRS has deployed various software tools to agents working cases involving virtual currency transactions. We are able to trace transactions and taxpayers on the blockchain as well as through various data sources we have, which we can then use in evaluating whether a particular taxpayer is tax compliant. It’s always important to keep in mind that any transaction has two sides, not just one. There is always both a sender and a receiver. In addition, there is always a transmission of the value between the sender and receiver and this is where many transactions become visible on the blockchain. When the blockchain, which is by definition, a `public, distributed ledger’ is used, the transaction trail is visible and can be traced.”TaxBit’s new Network won’t allow individuals to generate free reports that go back to years prior to 2021. But for anyone who engaged in cryptocurrency transactions without reporting them in past years, now is the time to consider paying for services like what TaxBit is offering to get ready to come into compliance. Just be sure to do so with a qualified tax lawyer who can advise on the best way to come in <a aria-label=without getting criminally prosecuted class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/founders-of-crypto-ico-plead-guilty-to-tax-evasion-after-raising-24-million-from-investors href=https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/founders-of-crypto-ico-plead-guilty-to-tax-evasion-after-raising-24-million-from-investors rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/founders-of-crypto-ico-plead-guilty-to-tax-evasion-after-raising-24-million-from-investors>without getting criminally prosecuted</a>.This article was modified at 10:23 central to make clear that the TaxBit Network includes supported TaxBit Network Companies. <p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I try tax cases in tax court and federal courts, represent taxpayers who are examined by the IRS, and represent tax professionals who get into disciplinary trouble.&amp;nbsp; I'm also a professional partnership representative.&amp;nbsp; My practice is in Chicago but my clients are all over the country and the world.&amp;nbsp; Check out my website at www.mooretaxlawgroup.com.&amp;nbsp; Email me at guinevere.moore@mooretaxlawgroup.com and follow me at @Mommytax&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;>"
Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Several market observers weigh in on what's next for bitcoin.Bitcoin prices have had an interesting day today, declining to their lowest in more than three months and then bouncing back. The world’s largest digital currency by market value dropped to $39,677.65 this morning, according to <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a>. At this point, it was trading at its most depressed value since late September, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. The digital currency then recovered somewhat, rising above $42,000 during the afternoon and trading near $41,800 at the time of this writing. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Following these latest price fluctuations, where is bitcoin likely to go next? Several analysts weighed in, offering their point of view on the matter.Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at <a aria-label=StockCharts.com class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://stockcharts.com/ href=https://stockcharts.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://stockcharts.com/>StockCharts.com</a>, claimed these latest declines provided additional confirmation of bitcoin’s bearish trend. “The drop below 45,500 support confirmed the down trend in BTC that is underway after completing a double top formation on the break below 60k,” he stated. “Breaking below 45.5k triggered another acceleration lower and a test of the next support level around 40k,” the analyst added. “For now support has come into play around 40k while the old support level at 45.5k can now be expected to start acting as resistance.” “As long as the series of lower highs and lower lows remains intact, the ease of movement is to the downside,” de Kempenaer emphasized. “On another break lower below 40k, there is a bit of support around 37k but the main level to watch is around 30k (29.5-32.0k),” he added. “That is where major support is clustered.” Josh Olszewicz, head of research at <a aria-label=Valkyrie Investments class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://valkyrieinvest.com/ href=https://valkyrieinvest.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://valkyrieinvest.com/>Valkyrie Investments</a>, also spoke to a bearish shift that has been taking place in the bitcoin markets. “As price trend metrics, such as low time moving averages, shifted from strongly bullish to neutral, additional risk-off-related rate hike eventualities and fears are now fueling bearish price action and shifting these moving averages from neutral to bearish,” he stated. “BTC experienced its first so-called ‘death cross’ this week since June 2021 and ETH is also likely to undergo its first death cross since May 2020 - both of which signify an important shift to declining bullish trend strength since March 2020,” noted Olszewicz. He also spoke to the digital asset’s historic support, stating that it “sits from $31,000 to $40,000.” William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform <a aria-label=Token Metrics class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://tokenmetrics.com/ href=https://tokenmetrics.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://tokenmetrics.com/>Token Metrics</a>, also provided some input on this subject. “There is very strong support in BTC just below 40k. There may be big buy orders below 40k.”“I suspect consolidation may be in order this week,” he noted. “The best support for BTC is 34k,” Noble added. “If BTC hits 34k, a bounce to 52k could come soon after.” Collin Plume, CEO and founder of <a aria-label=My Digital Money class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/ href=https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/>My Digital Money</a>, shed some additional light on bitcoin’s price support. “I think Bitcoin will still see a support level between $42k-$45K,” he stated. “This dip is influenced by the government increasing yield bonds, reducing money printing, increasing interest rates, and reducing its balance sheet. This is sending investors to bonds and other more conservative assets,” said Plume. “Then, there is the addition of several countries banning bitcoin mining - Kosovo, Iran and a few others,” he noted. “The third factor is active traders. I think there's a conscious effort to push Bitcoin and the rest of the market down for two things: taxes and to buy in again for a much lower price.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Analysts shed some light on what pushed bitcoin below $40,000.

At this point, it had reached its lowest value since September 21, additional CoinDesk figures show. The digital currency only traded at this level for a brief time, quickly bouncing back and surpassing $42,000 later today. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining these latest price movements, analysts offered varying perspectives. “I think the continuation of intense sell-offs, unexpected margin calls, and forced liquidations across the broad cryptocurrency market are driving Bitcoin prices below $40,000,” John Iadeluca, founder &amp; CEO of multi-strategy fund <a aria-label=Banz Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.banz.capital/ href=https://www.banz.capital/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.banz.capital/>Banz Capital</a>, said earlier today.“January is also historically a month where Bitcoin has crashed substantially directly prior to the beginning of a subsequent bear market, which may be adding some downward psychological pressure on Bitcoin traders,” he added. Iadeluca pointed to the sharp declines that bitcoin suffered during Januaries in years like 2018. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a aria-label=BitBull Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ href=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/>BitBull Capital</a>, also weighed in. “Bitcoin has been in a downtrend with extensive selling pressure since late December and the current price action is a result of it losing several key support levels,” he stated. “Since market participants have been aggressively longing potential bottom prices during this drop, each subsequent price decline results in cascading liquidations,” said DiPasquale.Andrew Rossow, an internet and technology attorney, also offered his point of view, asserting that the fear of both consumers and investors has been fueling sales and pushing bitcoin prices lower. He mentioned “consumer fear based upon previous data that we've collected in previous months, specifically around June of 2021,” stating that it is causing bitcoin to fall. Rossow also brought up “fears that the federal government is going to remain focused strictly on inflation control, rather than a macro perspective of these drops” as a factor placing downward pressure on the digital currency’s price. He elaborated on the situation. “It is my personal opinion that since the government has recently focused its attention on inflation, that it has created concern for consumers - it's very easy to get stuck on previous market behavior.” Rossow described “the intense sell-offs” as being “a big part of consumers/investors expressing that fear.”“The biggest takeaway we continue to see with these kinds of drops and subsequent consumer behavior based upon those drops is speculation and a fear that bitcoin will never recover.”“These ‘false signals’ or false indicators guide individuals to forcibly liquidate, sell, or otherwise believe bitcoin is in trouble. It’s not.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Jan 10 2022 10:09am,"The price of bitcoin fell to a three-month low Monday morning, continuing a slide that began when the Federal Reserve sparked a broad sell-off last week by cautioning it may move more quickly than previously expected to reverse policy meant to bolster the economy during the pandemic, and experts forecast the latest crypto drawback could persist for weeks if the central bank’s hawkish stance becomes more aggressive.Bitcoin fell below $40,000 for the first time since September on Monday.Bitcoin fell as much as 5% to $39,692 by 9:45 a.m. ET, according to crypto data website CoinGecko, bringing its losses to more than 12% since the Fed <a aria-label=warned class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/01/05/stocks-plunge-after-fed-minutes-show-central-bank-could-remove-more-stimulus/?sh=5e92fe304448 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/01/05/stocks-plunge-after-fed-minutes-show-central-bank-could-remove-more-stimulus/?sh=5e92fe304448 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/01/05/stocks-plunge-after-fed-minutes-show-central-bank-could-remove-more-stimulus/?sh=5e92fe304448>warned</a> on Wednesday it may move more aggressively to remove pandemic-era stimulus as it looks to combat high levels of inflation.In a weekend email, analyst Yuya Hasegawa of cryptocurrency broker Bitbank cautioned he expects the world's largest cryptocurrency could continue falling until the broader market, which has similarly <a aria-label=struggled class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/01/05/stocks-plunge-after-fed-minutes-show-central-bank-could-remove-more-stimulus/?sh=5e92fe304448 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/01/05/stocks-plunge-after-fed-minutes-show-central-bank-could-remove-more-stimulus/?sh=5e92fe304448 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/01/05/stocks-plunge-after-fed-minutes-show-central-bank-could-remove-more-stimulus/?sh=5e92fe304448>struggled</a> since the Fed's Wednesday announcement, digests the likelihood of the Fed hiking interest rates as soon as March.Though Hasegawa said bitcoin could fall as low as $40,000 in the near term, the analyst cautioned the government's consumer price index report due out Wednesday could intensify the price weakness if it shows inflation spiked more than expected, further justifying the Fed’s decision to ease stimulus and raise rates.In a Monday note, Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at UK-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said he expects bitcoin will hover around $40,000 even if the CPI report on Wednesday shows inflation rose more quickly than expected last month, positing the recent sell-off has likely priced in much of the negative expectations.On Thursday, crypto billionaire <a aria-label=Mike Novogratz class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2018/02/07/michael-novogratz-galaxy-digital-ethereum-crypto-cryptocurrency-ether/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2018/02/07/michael-novogratz-galaxy-digital-ethereum-crypto-cryptocurrency-ether/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2018/02/07/michael-novogratz-galaxy-digital-ethereum-crypto-cryptocurrency-ether/>Mike Novogratz</a>, the CEO of financial services firm Galaxy Digital, <a aria-label=told class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/mike-novogratz-sees-bitcoin-finding-bottom-at-38-000-40-000 href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/mike-novogratz-sees-bitcoin-finding-bottom-at-38-000-40-000 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/mike-novogratz-sees-bitcoin-finding-bottom-at-38-000-40-000>told</a> CNBC the selloff could push bitcoin down another 8% from current prices to as low as $38,000—a level unseen since early August.“I'm not nervous in the medium term but we're going to have a lot of volatility in the next few weeks,” the staunch bitcoin bull said told CNBC, before pointing to <a aria-label=booming class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-funds-attracted-9-3b-in-inflows-in-2021-as-institutional-adoption-grew href=https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-funds-attracted-9-3b-in-inflows-in-2021-as-institutional-adoption-grew rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-funds-attracted-9-3b-in-inflows-in-2021-as-institutional-adoption-grew>booming</a> institutional adoption as a bullish indicator for the nascent space. Bitcoin was far from alone in falling Monday morning. Over the past 24 hours, ether, binance coin and sol were down as much as 5%—pushing losses to roughly 20% apiece over the last week.Though Fed officials last month said they project only three interest rate hikes this year, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said Monday he expects the central bank will actually hike interest rates four times this year given a greater sense of urgency than he previously expected in the Fed's Wednesday announcement.Bitcoin remains vulnerable to a breach of the $40,000 level, and it could get bad for ether if it breaks the $3,000 level, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Ed Moya wrote in a Friday email. Ether prices clocked in at about $2,985 on Monday.  The long-term outlook is still bullish for both the top two cryptocurrencies, but the short-term is looking ugly.

Pandl said he expects bitcoin's share of the crypto market, currently about 41%, will most likely rise over time as a byproduct of broader adoption of digital assets and that the cryptocurrency will increasingly compete with gold as a hedge against inflation. $1.9 trillion.

Jan 10 2022 09:12am,"Canadian bitcoin mining company Bitfarms announced Monday it invested $43.2 million in bitcoin as the cryptocurrency plummeted about 12% during the first week of the year, becoming the latest publicly traded company doubling down on the nascent crypto market despite some experts warning its volatility makes it an unreliable investment. Bitcoin prices have fallen about 12% this year but have skyrocketed nearly 4,300% over the past five <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

MicroStrategy, which owns more bitcoin than any other corporation in the world, holds about 124,400 coins worth nearly $5.1 billion, while Tesla’s roughly 43,200 coins are worth about $1.8 billion.“Volatility in bitcoin shows that companies cannot rely on cryptocurrencies as sound corporate cash investments,” Jerry Klein, the managing partner of $9 billion advisory Treasury Partners, wrote in an email to <em>Forbes</em> last month. “Corporate investors get none of the sweets, but all of the indigestion by investing in bitcoin.” Accounting rules require corporations to treat bitcoin as an intangible asset, Klein says, meaning firms “must write down the value if the price declines, but they can’t write up the value if the price appreciates.”Trading at about $40,800 on Monday morning, bitcoin has plunged roughly 40% from a record high of $69,000 in November, as the broader market reels from the prospect of central banks pulling pandemic-era economic stimulus more quickly than was previously expected. “The long-term outlook is still bullish for both the top two cryptocurrencies, but the short term is looking ugly, Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya wrote in a weekend note. Despite bitcoin’s bouts of intense volatility, Goldman Sachs analysts <a aria-label=wrote class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/01/08/looking-ugly-crypto-prices-tumble-again-after-300-billion-sell-off-how-low-can-bitcoin-go/?sh=7cc9e2c33e0c href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/01/08/looking-ugly-crypto-prices-tumble-again-after-300-billion-sell-off-how-low-can-bitcoin-go/?sh=7cc9e2c33e0c target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/01/08/looking-ugly-crypto-prices-tumble-again-after-300-billion-sell-off-how-low-can-bitcoin-go/?sh=7cc9e2c33e0c>wrote</a> in a note to clients last week that the cryptocurrency could top $100,000 in the next five years, as it increasingly competes with gold as an inflationary hedge.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> price surged to never-before-seen highs. Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have also rocketed higher. </span>Bitcoin may have applications beyond simply a 'store of value'—and digital asset markets are much bigger than bitcoin—but we think that comparing its market capitalization to gold can help put parameters on plausible outcomes for bitcoin returns, Zach Pandl, co-head of foreign exchange strategy at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note. Bitcoin currently has a market capitalization of around $800 billion compared to gold's $11.4 trillion.Hypothetically, if bitcoin's share of the store of value market were to rise to 50% over the next five years (with no growth in overall demand for stores of value) its price would increase to just over $100,000, for a compound annualized return of 17% to 18%.Bitcoin's reputation as a digital store of value similar to gold has been propelled by the soaring inflation that's hit economies around the world over the last year. In May 2020, renowned investor Paul Tudor Jones put bitcoin firmly on Wall Streets's map when he named it as a the fastest horse to beat inflation.Bitcoin has superior monetary qualities to gold, and once it reaches a critical mass of adoption as a store of value, bitcoin has huge potential to grow into a global reserve currency and universal unit of account, Hong Fang, the chief executive of crypto exchange Okcoin, said in emailed comments, pointing to bitcoin's scarcity via its fixed supply of 21 million coins, its digital durability and accessibility, as well as its resistance to censorship. Bitcoin is not just an asset class—the bitcoin network is proving to be a viable global payment network, with bitcoin being programmable money, added Fang. In 2022, we’ll continue to see bitcoin prove itself as not just a store of value, but also a medium of exchange and unit of account.The bitcoin price has rocketed a little over 400% since January 2020, riding an asset price boom that's pushed stock markets to all-time highs—and helped the price of ethereum to outpace bitcoin.

After the release of the Fed’s December meeting minutes, hinting at a more decisive move to scale back its expansionary monetary policy to tackle inflation, negative investor sentiment caused bitcoin to lose the key $46,000 level, said Morch. Once that support was breached, liquidations followed within minutes. For a few weeks now, we’ve been clearly in a downtrend and there are no signs of a decisive reversal in sight.The crypto price crash comes some six months after the bitcoin price was hard hit by a China crypto crackdown and confidence was knocked by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk appearing to sour on bitcoin. The bitcoin price hit a low of $29,000 in late July before rebounding and recovering to above its previous high. There are striking similarities between the current price action and the market moves between mid-May and August do give reasons for cautious optimism in the medium term, said Morch. A bounce to around $47,000 in the next few days could corroborate that thesis while further losses would largely invalidate it. In any case, only a clear break above $50,000 would signal a major reversal in the trend and investors should keep in mind the inherently volatile nature of the digital asset market.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last 12 months, with its volatility matched by smaller <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> cryptocurrencies ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, cardano and XRP. </span>Other bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors aren't concerned by the recent downturn, confidently predicting a robust rebound in prices. The Fed caused a knee-jerk sell-off on Wall Street and the crypto market as it is perceived by some traders that such a move puts at risk the liquidity that has benefitted many asset classes, including bitcoin, Nigel Green, chief executive of the financial advisory and asset management deVere Group, said in emailed comments. However, I believe that we will see bitcoin robustly rebound as the dust settles. This will then boost others in the crypto market—such as ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, cardano and XRP—because bitcoin and other digital currencies are widely regarded as a shield against inflation.Over the last year, the likes of ethereum and its biggest rivals Binance's BNB, solana and cardano have outperformed the bitcoin price. The ethereum price has risen 165% over the last year despite the recent crypto price crash. Solana, now the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by value, is up a blistering 6,500% on this January 2021. Bitcoin has underperformed not only the crypto-space over the last few weeks, with a raft of altcoins ... recording hefty gains, said DailyFX's Nicholas Cawley. Bitcoin’s market dominance is now just under 40% compared to a level of just under 70% this time last year.While many bitcoin and crypto investors are confident that bitcoin and the wider crypto market will rebound, others see continued extreme volatility on crypto markets as a problem that needs to be resolved.Whatever the merits of cryptocurrency such wild swings would preclude it from supplanting traditional currencies any time soon, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said via email.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices may be headed for short-term gains, said several analysts. (Photo by Dan <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Kitwood/Getty Images)</span>Bitcoin prices suffered a modest pullback today, falling roughly 10% in less than 24 hours and trading at their lowest in more than a month. The world’s most prominent digital currency dropped to $42,503.88 around 5:30 p.m. EST, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. At this point, the cryptocurrency had declined approximately 9.7% since reaching an intraday high of more than $47,000 this morning, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. Since then, bitcoin prices have bounced back somewhat, rising to more than $43,750 close to 8:30 p.m. EST. Following these latest price movements, where is the digital asset’s price likely to go next? Several market observers shed some light on the matter. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] “While this week's drop in Bitcoin has been severe, the downtrend in Bitcoin has been well-established since November 2021,” said David Keller, chief market strategist at <a aria-label=StockCharts.com class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://stockcharts.com/ href=https://stockcharts.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://stockcharts.com/>StockCharts.com</a>.“This pattern of distribution has pushed the price down below the early December low around 44,000,” he stated. “Price support should be expected between current levels and the September 2021 low around 40,000.” Pat White, cofounder and CEO of <a aria-label=Bitwave class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitwave.io/ href=https://www.bitwave.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitwave.io/>Bitwave</a>, also spoke to the matter. “Bitcoin’s run down from 69k has been like they describe war, long moments of sideway boredom interrupted by days of sheer terror,” he stated. “Obviously each 10k notch is worth watching, 40k is the next natural floor,” said White. “There is most likely a pretty stable floor in this range – as all things crypto were taking off last year, a lot of businesses and institutions were genuinely worried they missed the train.”“Additionally, investors also likely began thinking about their tax bills and have started liquidating/ taking profits.” Collin Plume, CEO and founder of <a aria-label=My Digital Money class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/ href=https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.mydigitalmoney.com/>My Digital Money</a>, also commented on the situation, identifying some key technical levels. “Bitcoin will see a key level of support at $45,000 – where it will sit comfortably for a while – and see resistance at around $55,000,” he stated. Plume also weighed in on how altcoins (digital currencies besides bitcoin) are affecting the world’s most largest cryptocurrency by market value. “If we take a step back and look at the bigger picture, Bitcoin’s recent volatility can be connected to the rise of altcoins such as Solana, NEO, and Cardano. These altcoins are distributing the interest of investors and creating a healthy and competitive market.” “I suspect that once the dust settles around these altcoins, Bitcoin will regain its momentum in 2022.” White also weighed in on what the future might hold for this digital currency, offering a bullish outlook. “If you think of the movement today as mostly technical (there wasn’t really any major news that would cause this and other tokens are holding their own pretty well), then you’re going to see a lot of people excited to get in on the bargain sale,” he said. “I expect we see a pretty quick bounce back off this, though don't be surprised if we see a rebalancing into Ethereum, Solana, and other tokens.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Fears over soaring inflation in 2020 caused the likes of renowned investor Paul Tudor Jones to announce he was buying bitcoin, declaring it the fastest horse to beat inflation—helping the bitcoin price hit an all-time high of almost $70,000 in November last year.Last month, inflation in the U.S. hit levels not seen since 1982, piling pressure on the Federal Reserve to accelerate its planned stimulus tapering and increase interest rates from their record lows.

They may have lost loved ones or fell stricken with the disease. For nearly two years, we’ve been operating under stress, fear and anxiety.Lockdowns, school closures, working from home and feeling isolated, living in dread of getting sick, nonstop divisive politics and the mass media purveying doom and gloom every hour, all day long, has taken a mental-health toll. It's especially hard for working mothers that have to juggle careers and tend to child care. Another group took a different approach. These folks revived the pre-pandemic <a aria-label=“hustle porn class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/11/01/whats-one-work-thing-you-did-before-the-pandemic-that-youll-never-do-again/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/11/01/whats-one-work-thing-you-did-before-the-pandemic-that-youll-never-do-again/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/11/01/whats-one-work-thing-you-did-before-the-pandemic-that-youll-never-do-again/>“hustle porn</a>” culture, but in a new, positive and empowering way. Before the virus outbreak, you saw it all over LinkedIn, Twitter and other social media sites. So-called gurus and influencers brag about waking up at 5:00 a.m., going for a long run, workout at the gym and drink an obscure expensive tea that offers amazing health benefits. After making breakfast for their family and dropping the kids off at school, they go to the office and kill it all day long. The regular workday wasn’t sufficient. They slayed it at night and weekends too.The low-key inference is that if you were not grinding, you’re weak, lazy and a complete loser. Winning is everything and you need to brag online about all of your amazing achievements and how incredibly successful you are. Of course, you must broadcast all of the trappings of your wealth, including luxury sports cars, mansions and hosting crazy over-the-top parties with a guest list of models, actors and celebrities. During the pandemic, we saw a different type of hustle porn develop. A confluence of events, including being at home, which offered extra free time, an accommodating Federal Reserve that flushed money into the economy and the government sending out rounds of stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits, set the stage for taking chances to make a lot of money.The pandemic has caused people to lose their jobs or work from home. College students had their in-class lectures canceled and were forced to learn over Zoom calls. Seemingly overnight, people who never invested in the stock market became enamored with day trading stocks touted on Reddit’s <a aria-label=r/wallstreetbets class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/ href=https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/>r/wallstreetbets</a>, placed trades on Robinhood’s apps and other platforms. A segment of the active traders dispensed with purchasing shares and bought cheap, risky, out-of-the-money calls, which offered them significantly more leverage and outsized gains.  Entrepreneurship flourished, as the U.S. started new businesses at a record-setting rate, in what was deemed  a “<a aria-label=startup boom class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/11/10/933105790/the-unexpected-boom-in-startups href=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/11/10/933105790/the-unexpected-boom-in-startups rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/11/10/933105790/the-unexpected-boom-in-startups>startup boom</a>.” John Haltiwanger, an economist at the University of Maryland, said that within the first two months of the virus outbreak, there was a noticeable rise in new business applications. Haltiwanger stated, The <a aria-label=third quarter class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20201109&amp;utm_term=4949996&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=1801112&amp;orgid=145 href=https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20201109&amp;utm_term=4949996&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=1801112&amp;orgid=145 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20201109&amp;utm_term=4949996&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=1801112&amp;orgid=145>third quarter</a> of 2020 is the highest quarter of applications we've ever seen. <em>Inc. Magazine</em>, a publisher that covers small, emerging businesses, echoed Haltiwanger’s findings and wrote, “Over the past three months, more new businesses were launched in the U.S. than in any quarter in history.” The report showed, “Between June and September, nearly <a aria-label=1.4 million startups were founded class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/new-data-reveals-a-record-breaking-increase-in-small-business-startups-why-that-matters-to-you.html href=https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/new-data-reveals-a-record-breaking-increase-in-small-business-startups-why-that-matters-to-you.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/new-data-reveals-a-record-breaking-increase-in-small-business-startups-why-that-matters-to-you.html>1.4 million startups were founded</a>.”There was a steady flow of initial public offerings and SPACs. Even Zillow, the online real estate listing service, got into mass house flippings. Meta, along with a number of other companies and professionals, are furiously working toward building the metaverse. They see this as the next level of the internet.

YouTube social media star and boxer Logan Paul purchased  around 139 NFTs from 16 collections at a total cost of $2.645 million.Social media amplified these and other trends. Watching others make a lot of money, once again, puts people into two camps. One group waves off the trends as a fad and contends the people involved with buying Bitcoin, meme stocks and NFTs will end up losing all or most of their money. Many others have been inspired to pivot their careers or reinvent themselves rather than suffer from FOMO—the fear of missing out. They don’t want to be standing on the sidelines, while their classmates, co-workers, friends and neighbors are doing extremely well.

Some of El Salvador's regional neighbors who are also dependant on the U.S. dollar have said they're closely watching the country's bitcoin experiment for signs of success. Some political leaders have indicated they'd be willing to adopt bitcoin if it's able to reduce remittance costs as Bukele has claimed.

Even with these accommodations, seats were left unfilled.There is another sweetener that some businesses are considering to attract people to join their firms—paying in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. In 2021, we saw digital assets go parabolic. The number of new crypto projects and incredible rise in value of the asset class caught America and the world’s attention. To some people, purchasing digital assets was viewed as a hedge against the U.S. dollar that’s being devalued, due to rising inflation and questionable policies from the federal government and Federal Reserve bank. Other folks, especially young people, saw cryptocurrencies as a YOLO (You-Only-Live-Once) trade that could make them rich quickly. Burdened with heavy college tuition debt payments and exorbitant apartment and home prices, coupled with an alarming inflation rate raising the prices of everything, digital assets seemed the only way to get ahead financially.If you get paid in U.S. dollars, as inflation increases, the value of your paycheck decreases. Recent data from the <a aria-label=Bureau of Labor Statistics class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf href=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf>Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> highlights rising costs. The consumer price index in September spiked 5.4% higher in 2021. The growth was so fast and furious that the U.S. government called for a nearly <a aria-label=6% cost-of-living increase for people on Social Security class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/social-security-cost-of-living-adjustment-will-be-5point9percent-in-2022.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/social-security-cost-of-living-adjustment-will-be-5point9percent-in-2022.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/social-security-cost-of-living-adjustment-will-be-5point9percent-in-2022.html>6% cost-of-living increase for people on Social Security</a>. This was the largest hike in four decades.  The sad reality is that if you didn’t receive a hefty raise in 2021, and inflation remains the same or keeps raging higher, you’ll actually see a decrease in pay. This doesn’t mean the company pays you less, it's that the purchasing power from your salary doesn’t have the same value as it once did. It's like a race in which you are standing still and everyone is running past you. Each dollar you have is devalued and it takes more money to buy the same products compared to a year or so ago.We are seeing signs of change in payments. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said he would take a paycheck “<a aria-label=100% in Bitcoin class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/miami-mayor-seeks-wider-crypto-use-after-taking-pay-in-bitcoin href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/miami-mayor-seeks-wider-crypto-use-after-taking-pay-in-bitcoin rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/miami-mayor-seeks-wider-crypto-use-after-taking-pay-in-bitcoin>100% in Bitcoin</a>,” and will also offer cryptocurrencies to public employees too.

There is a lot of volatility in this space.In 2021, the price of bitcoin hit $67,000 and subsequently plunged to under $30,000, and then bounced back again. Ethereum saw record highs of around $4,800 on December 1, only to see it trade lower at around $3,600 to $3,900. If you were paid in bitcoin, Ethereum or other coins at a high point, then the price cratered.

Sometimes Berrios needs to walk up the mountains for hours to make house calls.”Poor dental hygiene is widely acknowledged to be a contributor to mental illness and low self esteem, particularly among people who are missing most of their teeth – a reality faced by many of the elderly patients under Berrios’s care.As well as affecting their psychological well-being, the condition can be so severe that it impacts nutritional health by limiting diets.It is not just a lack of access to food but also being unable to eat that makes their lives more difficult. Unable to chew, they often have to swallow food, the website explains. They have few choices to eat, often resorting to a diet of softened tortillas.BTCPay Server developer and Bitcoin Smiles founder Pavlenex said the initiative started as a one-off but now “definitely has potential to reach a proper non-profit entity setup”.In the mean time, <a aria-label=Bitcoin Smiles is documenting Berrios’s work in videos and photos posted to its Twitter account class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://mobile.twitter.com/bitcoinsmiles href=https://mobile.twitter.com/bitcoinsmiles rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://mobile.twitter.com/bitcoinsmiles>Bitcoin Smiles is documenting Berrios’s work in videos and photos posted to its Twitter account</a>.

Dec 31 2021 12:28pm,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JUNE 17: Photographer Kevin O'Leary Hosts Preview For His Photo Exhibit Irreconcilable Images at Timothy Yarger Fine Art Inc on June 17, 2016 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Tommaso Boddi/WireImage)<em>In recent years, Shark Tank host Kevin O’Leary has transitioned from a crypto skeptic to an enthusiast, investor and evangelist. He holds multiple positions in the industry and has also become a paid spokesperson and endorser for crypto exchange FTX. In this interview we discuss how his background as a venture capitalist and software investor informs his financial decisions, ways that the regulatory landscape has evolved over the years and where crypto fits into a diversified portfolio. He also has some very interesting thoughts related to NFTs how investors should weight bitcoin v. ether.</em><strong>Forbes: How do you approach your crypto investments?</strong><strong>O’Leary: </strong>Ether is my largest position, bigger than bitcoin. It’s because so many of the financial services and transactions are occurring on it. Even new software is being developed like Polygon that consolidates transactions and reduces the overall cost in terms of gas fees on Ethereum. I’m an investor in that as well. So to me, the best way to look at this, and I get questioned on this issue all the time, do you like bitcoin over ether? Do you like solana over polygon, hedera, all of that; I look at things differently. I don’t think about bitcoin as a coin or token, I think about it as software. Bitcoin is software. Ethereum is software. Hedera is software. I grew up in my entire career investing in software development teams. That’s what I did at and after the Learning Company. I work with software developers, coders and programmers, and that’s where I deploy capital all the time. So I’m just viewing the entire crypto industry as software development teams and I spend my time speaking with them—I just came back from Dubai where I met the Polygon team—and make investment decisions based on the skills of those software engineers. I know the market is going to be the market, it will determine the winners and the losers of these platforms. But at the end of the day, it’s the really strong creative software engineers that you want to bet on. And that’s what I’ve done.<em>Excerpted from Forbes CryptoAsset and Blockchain Advisor.

I have many positions now and I’m going to disclose everything because I don’t want to be ever accused of promoting a token or a coin. I don’t like that. I make long-term investments here, and so I will be disclosing that shortly. But I’ve mentioned some of the ones I own. I own <strong>Hedera, Polygon, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana,</strong> <strong>Serum</strong>—these are bets on software development teams and there are many, many use cases for them. I think we’re going to see a lot of different use cases emerge over time. For example, I’m not sure that Ethereum is the best platform for financial services transactions because it’s too slow. So how do you fix that? Or do you use Polygon to consolidate transactions. Maybe it’s too expensive as well for some countries like India, so I want to make different bets.<strong>Forbes: What characteristics or qualities will separate the winners from the losers?</strong><strong>O’Leary:</strong> At the end of the day, what determines the platform’s success and value is the speed and level of adoption. That occurs when the team has developed a platform that solves an economic problem. I always say this about digital currencies and digital platforms. What problem are you solving? Are you enhancing a transaction, reducing friction in financial markets? Accelerating transaction speed or accuracy? Or authenticating them? What are you doing that has economic value? So I would argue long term coins that have no economic value are that because they don’t solve anything or create any value. I’m very skeptical of meme coins long term. The reason Ethereum is so large now is because it was first and it was widely adopted. Now, because some of its shortcomings are being noticed by certain sectors of the economy, these other teams, Polygon, Solana and others are saying, well, it’s not good enough for what we’re doing. And we’re going to make some changes here. That is very much worth investing in.<strong>Forbes: How would you define a bubble and do you think we are in one?</strong><strong>O’Leary:</strong> That’s a great question. I’ve watched bubbles grow and pop and everything else. The thing to realize is, the market is the market. No one person can manipulate it, even though people claim they can. It’s millions of decisions being made every second in terms of what something is worth. And it applies to every market, whether it’s tulips, watches, bitcoin, real estate or gold. It’s the same dynamics, when you have a large participation in the asset class and millions of people buy and sell it. The only thing I trust is the market price. Because you can’t say it’s overvalued or undervalued, the market determines that for you. You can make a long-term bet that it will appreciate over time for various reasons. But when you start to say something as a bubble, you’re effectively saying you’re going to do some market timing; that you know something that everybody else doesn’t know. And once in a while, you can be right. But over the long run, it’s a fool’s game and you can’t win. My attitude about this is allocation and diversification. So if you tell me that bitcoin is in a bubble and overvalued, you may be right. But it doesn’t really matter to me in terms of allocating to bitcoin, it’s going to be allocated to because it is an asset that millions of people own. And its market price is being determined by the 24 hours a day. I happen to think it’s an asset, not a currency. I like the software development underneath it. I think all the issues around ESG are going to get solved in the next couple of years. And it’s going to be more efficiently mined. But I love the market being the market. So that’s a really long answer to say, you can’t know when it’s a bubble, you simply can’t. And if you think you do, you’re absolutely wrong.<strong>Forbes: How do you think crypto fits into a diversified portfolio for my readers?</strong><strong>O’Leary</strong>: My answer is always the same. It’s a binary decision. First of all, many people are still skeptical about it and are not on board, so they don’t have any allocation problems. For those of us who have changed our minds, and I’m one of those constituencies, I have decided that this is a real asset class, that the software development has economic meaning, and I should be an investor in it. So diversification is my number two issue. Now in the stock and bond world, where these assets have been around for hundreds of years, I have very simple rules that mandate how I own them. I never let one stock become more than 5% weighting in any portfolio and I never let a sector (of which there are 11 in the S&amp;P) ever become more than 20%. I am using the same rules now that I use for them. Some people say to me, why don’t you just own bitcoin and ethereum, everything’s correlated to the price of those. I don’t believe that to be true. First, there are many other economic applications, software, level 1/2 blockchains that have nothing to do with bitcoin that I want to invest in. So what I’m trying to do is build a portfolio—at some point it might get to 20% of my operating company—but right now, it’s about 10.5%. But within that portfolio, there’s no one token coin or chain that’s more than 5% of that portfolio. So yes, I am actively adding and trimming based on volatility. And we’ve had lots of that in the last couple of weeks. And secondly, I’m doing a lot of staking. Most of my positions are now being staked, and I use the FTX platform for that (<em>NOTE:</em> <em>O’Leary is a paid spokesperson)</em>. And I also hold a significant and material position in USDC, because I am now starting to pay for assets and get paid in the stablecoin. So it’s become another currency in my portfolio. And I stake that as well. I’m working with Circle on that. I was one of the very first corporate accounts open there. <strong>Forbes: As we are conducting this interview, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire is testifying in front of the House Financial Services Committee to address crypto in general, but also discuss some key hot button issues such as stablecoins. Circle has become more transparent about its USDC reserves in recent months. How do you see the outlook for USDC and stablecoins? </strong><strong>O’Leary:</strong> I’m glad Jeremy is taking this bull by the horns and wanting to be part of creating policy for stablecoins. They are here to stay. I remember when I bought my first USDC, I think he had 2 billion under management or issued, but now it’s above 30 (<em>Note: USDC’s market capitalization is now $40.2 billion)</em>. So it’s been adopted widely by lots of corporate entities as well. But I would prefer that it’d be regulated, I would prefer that the rules be set by the regulator so that I can increase my exposure to it. And frankly, I’m not speaking on his behalf, I’m just speculating. If he had to become regulated like other banks, he would probably do that (<em>Circle applied for a banking license on TK)</em>. Just to be transparent, I am going to be an investor in Circle’s PIPE (private investment in public entity–its plan to go public via a SPAC merger next quarter). I’ve already decided that the stablecoin I’m going to use is USDC. I do not want to own any asset, and I don’t, that the SEC is investigating or litigating. I want nothing to do with that, I am not a crypto cowboy.<strong>Forbes: There is always a chance that the SEC could determine some of the other assets you mentioned, such as HBAR, SOL or MATIC as securities. Do you still feel comfortable holding those?</strong><strong>O’Leary:</strong> The minute that information gets out (suggesting they are securities) I will want nothing to do with them. If I had a position I would sell it. I have no interest in going into conflict with regulators over my crypto portfolio. I want to be 100% compliant. That’s my mantra every day and that’s because I want to play in the institutional market. I’m not interested in being some guy sitting at a desk with his iPhone trading bitcoin; that’s not what I do. And so this is the beginning of a very long process by which the regulator will set rules because everybody knows this asset class is not going away.<strong>Forbes: You briefly touched on this earlier, but can you describe the due-diligence process you go through when deciding whether to invest in a new token. Also, do you have any preference for Level 1/Level 2 tokens or look for a certain degree of traction before investing?</strong><strong>O’Leary:</strong> I have made investments in nascent tokens very early in their development. Same with Level 1 or Level 2 platforms. When I hear of a new team or a new idea, I simply call them up and either do a zoom call or physically meet with the team if I’m going to be in that country. Sometimes I acquire a control position, sometimes I just take a shareholding position. Sometimes I buy them with one of my public companies. I do all the above, but I go back to the idea that this is no different than when I was at the Learning Company looking at teams that were building educational software or gaming software. There’s no difference at all to me. I’ve been doing this for 35 years, and crypto is no different. It’s a very comfortable space to be in for me. I consider it software development and all the other social media hype, all the blogs, this dogecoin over bitcoin and yada, yada, yada, it’s all irrelevant to me. What matters to me is, what’s the software do? What problem does it solve? Where’s the economic value and who’s maintaining the code, that’s how I look at it?<strong>Forbes: To finish up, I’d love to get your thoughts on NFTs.</strong><strong>O’Leary: </strong>I think non-fungible tokens are going to be bigger than bitcoin. They offer so much value around authentication, inventory management and all kinds of use cases in different asset classes. I prefer NFTs tied to hard assets, physical assets; the one that I’m working on developing a white paper for is the watch industry. I’ve invested in that because we have so much fraud in watch collecting, which we can eliminate by using some very high resolution scanning of dials linked to NFTs, so that the watchmaker can identify what they made, when they made it and who owns it. I made a material investment in Jordan Fried’s company, Immutable Holdings, which owns NFT.com, which he’s launching in January, as well as WonderFi, which is a company that’s consolidating assets in the crypto space. They’re both large positions for me and I like the management teams, but they are focusing on creating value around the NFT market—curating them, creating them, managing them. There’s a lot of work going on in making these ubiquitous and very liquid so that an NFT can trade on any blockchain, whether it’s Solana, Ethereum, HBAR, whatever. These assets are going to be very big and I think 2022 is going to be the year of the NFT.<strong>Forbes: Thank you.</strong><em>Excerpted from December issue of </em><a aria-label=Forbes CryptoAsset &amp; Blockchain Advisor. class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=crypto&amp;sh=64eae147dec8 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=crypto&amp;sh=64eae147dec8 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=crypto&amp;sh=64eae147dec8><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=crypto&amp;sh=64eae147dec8>Forbes CryptoAsset &amp; Blockchain Advisor. </em></a><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am director of research for digital assets at Forbes.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"A revolutionary landFor the second time this year, the Islamic Republic of Iran has banned the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in an attempt to ease pressure on its crumbling energy infrastructure.Bitcoin miners deploy power-hungry computer hardware in a race to randomly discover – or mine – a specific string of numbers that the network needs in order to create new blocks of data. The prize for wading through trillions of wrong guesses is newly minted bitcoin; the cost is the electricity needed to keep the machines whirring away.Tehran is not ideologically opposed to the activity: <a aria-label=the Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade has issued more than 1,000 licenses to crypto mining farms class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/27/over-1000-bitcoin-miners-granted-licenses-in-iran-report/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/27/over-1000-bitcoin-miners-granted-licenses-in-iran-report/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/27/over-1000-bitcoin-miners-granted-licenses-in-iran-report/>the Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade has issued more than 1,000 licenses to crypto mining farms</a>, enticed by the higher export rates they pay for electricity.However, after decades of U.S. sanctions, Iran’s infrastructure is suffering from chronic under-investment.Blackouts were a regular occurrence over the summer as Iranians cranked up their air conditioners, prompting president Hassan Rouhani to announce a four-month ban on crypto mining. With winter now taking hold and heating appliances firing up across the country, the government has once again been forced to act.Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, director of the state-run Iran Grid Management Company, told state TV that the latest ban – effective until March – <a aria-label=should free up 209 megawatts of power daily for Iranian households class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/28/biran-orders-crypto-mining-ban-to-prevent-winter-blackouts href=https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/28/biran-orders-crypto-mining-ban-to-prevent-winter-blackouts rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/28/biran-orders-crypto-mining-ban-to-prevent-winter-blackouts>should free up 209 megawatts of power daily for Iranian households</a>.The Islamic Republic will also clamp down on unlicensed miners, he said, who are believed to consume three times as much energy as their law-abiding counterparts. Other, more traditional energy-saving measures – such as switching off street lights and curbing office consumption – are on the cards as well.Taken at face value, it’s hard to fault the government for targeting non-essential consumption like bitcoin mining.However, beyond temporarily reducing demand, the measure will do nothing to address structural problems with Iran’s creaking energy network. To the contrary, it will deter investment by one of the few sectors that is ready and willing – with or without sanctions – to bring an end to blackouts by helping the country transition to reliable, sustainable and cost-effective renewable energy.Iran has made no secret of its desire to go green.The country <a aria-label=generated 98% of its energy from natural gas and oil in 2019 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.iea.org/countries/iran href=https://www.iea.org/countries/iran rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.iea.org/countries/iran>generated 98% of its energy from natural gas and oil in 2019</a>, according to data collected by the International Energy Agency (IEA).In October, the Ministry of Energy, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (SATBA) tried to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by inviting the private sector to help <a aria-label=develop and build renewable power plants with a total daily capacity of 10,000 megawatts class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:http://www.satba.gov.ir/en/news/1797/Public-call-develop-and-build-10-000-MW-of-renewable-power-plants-with-the-help-of-the-private-sector href=http://www.satba.gov.ir/en/news/1797/Public-call-develop-and-build-10-000-MW-of-renewable-power-plants-with-the-help-of-the-private-sector rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=http://www.satba.gov.ir/en/news/1797/Public-call-develop-and-build-10-000-MW-of-renewable-power-plants-with-the-help-of-the-private-sector>develop and build renewable power plants with a total daily capacity of 10,000 megawatts</a>.But the problem facing Iran – <a aria-label=besides the ever-present threat of sanctions enforcement class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59242986 href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59242986 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59242986>besides the ever-present threat of sanctions enforcement</a> – is that achieving this goal requires foreign expertise, heavy capital expenditure and a willingness to accept short-term financial uncertainty. That’s because building power plants is only part of the solution. A bigger challenge is transmitting electricity from the remote regions where renewable energy is typically sourced to every city, town and village in the vast country.Whenever that’s not feasible with existing infrastructure – and whenever temporary lulls in demand create a surplus of generating capacity – Iran will fall victim to the <a aria-label=“stranded power problem” class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-humanitarian-and-environmental href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-humanitarian-and-environmental rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-humanitarian-and-environmental>“stranded power problem”</a> described by Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, in a recent essay for Bitcoin Magazine.In order for their economies to grow, they have to expand their electrical infrastructure,” he said of the challenges facing developing nations. “But when they … build power plants to try and capture renewable energy in remote places, that power often has nowhere to go.”One solution is the very activity that Iran has now grudgingly banned. Bitcoin could be an incentives game-changer,” Gladstein explained. “New power plants, no matter how remote, can generate immediate revenue, even with no transmission lines, by directing their energy to the bitcoin network and turning sunlight, water or wind into money … With bitcoin, any excess energy can be directed to mining until the communities around the plant catch up.Put another way, Iran can mitigate the financial and logistical hurdles of a green revolution by simply buying some mining machines and switching them on whenever its new power plants have energy to spare.This would guarantee a steady return on investment regardless of local conditions. What’s more, the bitcoins minted by the mining farms could be immediately sold for U.S. dollars, digital gold or any other hard asset that the government wants in its reserves. There would be no need to hold any cryptocurrency for longer than the split second it takes to sell it.Iran isn’t the only country that can benefit from adopting such an approach.In East Africa, a lobby group called <a aria-label=Project Mano is encouraging Ethiopia’s government to mine bitcoin class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/07/13/renewed-hope-how-bitcoin-and-green-energy-can-save-ethiopias-economy/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/07/13/renewed-hope-how-bitcoin-and-green-energy-can-save-ethiopias-economy/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/07/13/renewed-hope-how-bitcoin-and-green-energy-can-save-ethiopias-economy/>Project Mano is encouraging Ethiopia’s government to mine bitcoin</a> with the surplus energy it already generates across its mature network of hydroelectric, wind and solar power plants.

It did not address what the development will mean for SXP tokenholders and Swipe-issued cardholders.Swipe also runs a white label B2B program that helps third parties launch their own crypto-backed debit cards. Derivatives exchange FTX became its most high-profile client in February, though the FTX Visa card has not yet been launched.Following the completion of the share purchase, Swipe founder and chief executive Joselito Lizarondo “will step down and leave Binance”, the exchange said.However, Lizarondo plans to remain active as a key stakeholder in the Swipe blockchain – now rebranded Solar – by acquiring a sizable governance position through his proof-of-stake SXP holdings, and by launching the “Solar Ecosystem Growth Fund to invest in projects building on Solar”.“Solar will become an energy efficient payments blockchain powering decentralized commerce applications,” <a aria-label=he explained in a blogpost class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://blog.swipe.io/meet-solar-an-energy-efficient-delegated-proof-of-stake-blockchain-rebranded-for-sxp-d8cc714f21c7 href=https://blog.swipe.io/meet-solar-an-energy-efficient-delegated-proof-of-stake-blockchain-rebranded-for-sxp-d8cc714f21c7 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://blog.swipe.io/meet-solar-an-energy-efficient-delegated-proof-of-stake-blockchain-rebranded-for-sxp-d8cc714f21c7>he explained in a blogpost</a>. “Solars value proposition enables plugins to be developed in Javascript and Typescript and built in Layer 1 formats so that all scalability and smart contract like features will be developed natively.

While ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has fared less badly with a 20% drop from its peak, other smaller cryptocurrencies including Binance's BNB, solana, cardano and XRP have seen steeper declines.Whilst bitcoin’s overall trading volumes were consistent, a total of 129,800 option contracts (with value of just over $6 billion) are set to expire on the 31st December which is believed to be fuelling overall wary sentiment for the short term, Adrian Kenny, senior sales trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in a note this week.Around 130,000 bitcoin options contracts—bets on the future bitcoin price that allow traders to buy or sell the cryptocurrency at a specified price within a set time period—are set to expire on Friday, according to Skew data first reported by <a aria-label=Coindesk class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-slumps-to-below-48k-ahead-of-6b-options-expiry-202112290033 href=https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-slumps-to-below-48k-ahead-of-6b-options-expiry-202112290033 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-slumps-to-below-48k-ahead-of-6b-options-expiry-202112290033><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-slumps-to-below-48k-ahead-of-6b-options-expiry-202112290033>Coindesk</em></a>.It's thought bitcoin tends to move toward the so-called max pain point in the lead-up to an options expiry, followed by a solid directional move in days after settlement due to traders pushing the spot price closer to the strike price at which the highest number of open options contracts expire worthlessly—creating maximum losses (max pain) for option buyers.

It hit all-time highs despite all the “legends” saying it’s a worthless seashell for tech dorks. Wrong! Hey, it’s not $68,000, but it’ll get there again.Right?“Bitcoin will reach at least $200,000 by 2025,” says Paycer UG founder &amp; CTO Nils Gregersen in Hamburg, Germany. “But I am pretty sure we will see it fall to around $20,000 before hand.”Yikes!Okay, no panicking. I’ll buy it.What about the rest of the cryptocurrency space? There’s more to this market today than Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency investing is the new stock market. Everybody knows that.This year was a very interesting one for crypto. We saw trends coming and going very fast — with coins hyped up by influencers like Elon Musk — who gave Dogecoin a lift for a short time before it returned to being a dud coin. “There is a lot of pump in the market at the moment,” says Gregersen. “I think in 2022 we are going to see a little cooldown in the market. Only the stronger projects will survive. For the memecoins and other shady projects, I think the air gets a little thinner for them,” he says, adding that regulations will have an impact on DeFi cryptocurrencies, within varying degrees of positives and negatives.“DeFi will still be a thing in 2022. We have only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of DeFi,” says Gregersen. “There are many new products to come that we can't even imagine today.”Some DeFi trends expected next year: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) that offer unregulated, decentralized finance and a new regulated centralized- decentralized finance. Call it the yin and yang of DeFi, I guess. <a aria-label=CeDeFi class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://101blockchains.com/what-is-cedefi/ href=https://101blockchains.com/what-is-cedefi/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://101blockchains.com/what-is-cedefi/>CeDeFi </a>will offer less complex financial services based on DeFi but will hold hands with the regulators of financial markets and banking, in general. This might be the type of DeFi that Jim Cramer of Mad Money can get behind.Ava Labs president John Wu also predicts DeFi will have a good 2022. But he seems to like the GameFi space even more. “DeFi will continue to lead in terms of total value in the ecosystem, but blockchain gaming will introduce more people to crypto because the learning and adoption curves in gaming are notably smaller than that of DeFi,” he says. Yeah, I’m still playing video games on an X Box One. I don’t know about blockchain games. I have never stared into the eyes of any blockchain yet. I’ll have to do that this year.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> glasses sport game metaverse NFT game 3D cyber space futuristic neon colorful background.</span>“Gaming growth is outpacing new DeFi activity. Just wait until major developers and studios get involved,” Wu says.GameFi is considered a subset of the metaverse as most game developers in the blockchain world are building their ecosystem to be more linked to the virtual world. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are also an offshoot here — because diehard gamers will spend money for digital art, let alone weapons and other gear (or fake land) associated with a game. The metaverse is in its infancy. So this gives crypto investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of some of the newcomers. I own Decentraland (MANA) as my metaverse play. “Getting aboard the metaverse train today with all the connections to other aspects of blockchain evolution will be synonymous to getting aboard the Bitcoin train in its earliest days,” says Sven Wenzel, co-founder of Castello Coin, which operates in the digital art space. “An early investment in a metaverse token can amount to so much more in the longer term,” he says in comparing metaverse plays with the likes of Bitcoin.Castello Coin and Decentraland all run on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s still the No. 2 cryptocurrency investment after Bitcoin. How will Ethereum look in 2022?“I would invest in Ethereum. I would invest $200 every month in Ethereum,” says Gregersen.Overall, market participants expect more people opening accounts with exchanges. That’s a long term bullish signal for cryptocurrencies.I predict some of the more old school platforms (think E*Trade) will allow for investment in at least Bitcoin and Ethereum next year. That should get more people involved, especially those who can’t be bothered opening up a Gemini account, for instance.POLAND - 2020/06/15: In this photo illustration an Ethereum logo seen displayed on a smartphone. <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

We all have witnessed how our investments can snap back rather quickly from a 10% or 20% loss. In the past, this would have triggered a sustained downturn and ‘crypto winter’, but better risk management on the professional investor side means the market just has a snow day instead. People will be buying the dips in 2022. I know I will. After a 23 day battle with Covid, I’m ready to put some money to work in my Coinbase account again. I’ll probably load up on some Bitcoin. After these interviews, I might have to check in on MANA. Besides investing ideas, Wu from Ava Labs thinks more traditional brand name corporations will enter the space in 2022. “Look at the list of major media companies, sports leagues or content creators participating in digital assets at the start of the year versus the end of it,” he says. Deloitte and Mastercard recently linked up with Ava Labs to explore their Avalanche blockchain and its smart-contract enabled applications. This year was a true zero-to-60 growth in new blockchain protocols like Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT). Many Fortune 500 companies who used this year to explore what NFTs and digital assets can do for them will be two feet in, in 12 months’ time, Wu predicts. “They’ve seen their peers succeed and so the risk of failure is low enough to make a move,” he says. If you watched the World Series, you saw the FTX crypto exchange logo on the jerseys of the umpires.  Yes, you can buy and sell NFTs on FTX, like the currently priced $615 Stephen Curry NFT: The 2974 Collection.So 2021 was the year of NFTs, for sure. What will 2022 be the year of, if you had to pick one? More new blockchain projects, especially for businesses, says Wu.“I think you will see enterprise blockchain pilots move into the live stages a lot quicker than people expect,” he says.Sorry, haters, the world will still be investing in digital assets in 2022.

Mar 6 2022 06:45am ,"Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Which is the better hedge against inflation?With the debunking of the delusion that inflation in the US economy is “transitory,” investors have become more serious about finding hedges against it. According to <a aria-label=Motley Fool class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/12/06/is-ethereum-a-hedge-against-inflation/ href=https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/12/06/is-ethereum-a-hedge-against-inflation/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/12/06/is-ethereum-a-hedge-against-inflation/>Motley Fool</a>:<em>“The rate of inflation has been raising alarm among investors recently as the Fed has gone into a printing frenzy. There have been calls to stop the printing rate but so far, it has continued, causing inflation rates to shoot up.”</em>A growing chorus of voices have come out touting Bitcoin as a good hedge, including:There are dissenting (or, at least, countering) opinions coming from the likes of:A <a aria-label=study class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3970338 href=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3970338 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3970338>study</a> from a group of professors at various Australian universities looked at Ethereum as a hedge against inflation. The authors conclude that:<em>“Following the recent change in its transactions protocol, Ethereum displays a significantly lower net issuance rate of tokens than Bitcoin, achieved by destroying the fees associated with each transaction. In many cases, the amount of Ethereum burned outpaces the networks creation of new tokens, resulting in Ethereum potentially becoming the world’s first deflationary currency.”</em>The authors assert that this makes Ethereum a superior hedge against inflation—and a better long-term value store—than Bitcoin. The authors point to two reasons why:ETH Creation vs. DestructionThere are skeptics to the Ethereum as inflation hedge rationale, however. Motley Fool pointed out:<em>“An important thing to note about the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is that the goal is not to make Ethereum more scarce, but to bring down the gas fees and access to the network. In having each transaction burn the base fee, the network loses control over the supply of Ethereum, so while there may be times when Ethereum looks deflationary, it's also possible the cryptocurrency's supply could increase as well.”</em>The article goes on to quote Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading:<em>We see so much misinformation out there about how Ethereum is deflationary. Occasionally it is, but that's not the purpose. </em>Overall, Ethereum’s advantage over Bitcoin as an inflation hedge may have nothing to do with the supply of the cryptocurrency, and more to do with its utility for other purposes.

People see Ethereum as a technology bet. </em>Whichever side of the debate you lean towards, one thing is certain—inflation in the US and elsewhere is helping drive up crypto investing activity. On the flip side of the coin, gold—which was the preferred method of hedging for inflation among investors—is no longer serving the purpose it once fulfilled.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description='&lt;p&gt;Ron Shevlin is the Chief Research Officer at Cornerstone Advisors, where he publishes commissioned research reports on banking and fintech trends and advises both established and startup financial technology companies.

Szabo has previously denied he's Satoshi Nakamoto, telling financial author Dominic Frisby in 2014, I'm afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I'm used to it.Perhaps singular figures aren't even as important as the figures involved in the evolution of ideas that led to things, Musk told Fridman, asking: It's sad to think about history but maybe most names will be forgotten. What is the name anyway, it's a name, a name attached to an idea. What does it even mean?Satoshi Nakamoto's disappearance shortly after bitcoin's launch has led to feverish speculation over the last decade as to who's responsible for creating it and sparking the wider cryptocurrency gold rush that led to the creation of thousands of different coins.The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto has meanwhile helped bitcoin develop as an independent, decentralized technology. The creators of rival cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin, have struggled to escape their outsized influence over their projects, raising questions over centralization.Musk also told Fridman he doesn't understand ethereum-based smart contracts—blockchain-based, self-executing contracts that run when certain, preprogrammed conditions are met.I never quite understood how this whole smart contract thing, you know, said Musk, joking, I'm too dumb to understand smart contracts and saying: My general approach to any kind of like deal or whatever is just make sure there's clarity of understanding.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has rocketed and crashed in 2021, climbing to almost $70,000 per bitcoin last <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

But blockchain protocols like Ethereum and maybe startups working in the Metaverse that issue coins will do okay as the market now treats them like volatile penny stocks and not really as a currency to buy and sell with.

It’s apparent, especially in certain countries that are trying to come out with their own central bank digital currencies, that they are often instituting laws that either ban or greatly restrict the private crypto sector, in order to take out the competition on a national level,” says David Dobrovitsky, CEO of Glitter Finance, without mentioning the obvious here — China is doing precisely that. They are constantly talking up their pilot project in a digital renminbi, and have been busy cracking down in Bitcoin for at least two years.Glitter Finance was <a aria-label=given a grant by the Algorand Foundation class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://smartliquidity.info/2021/12/27/glitter-finance-received-grant-award-from-the-algorand-foundation/ href=https://smartliquidity.info/2021/12/27/glitter-finance-received-grant-award-from-the-algorand-foundation/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://smartliquidity.info/2021/12/27/glitter-finance-received-grant-award-from-the-algorand-foundation/>given a grant by the Algorand Foundation</a> on December 27 to build a cross-chain bridge between Algorand and Solana. Clearly, central banks, and their friends in governments, view Bitcoin as a threat to the current fiat system. “We have a fiat-based currency, supported by nothing, which can be printed to infinity, and therefore is highly susceptible to inflation,” says Dobrovitsky. “Putting an old currency into a digital format will not solve this problem,” he thinks. I don’t know if he is right on that.“A CBDC will be created by the same institutions that have created a global crisis of inflation,” Dobrovitsky says. Okay, that makes perfect sense.“It is a given that there will be a central bank digital currency, along with many other digital asset projects,” says Troy S. Wood, Project Lead at <a aria-label=Impel class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://impel-xdc-network.io/ href=https://impel-xdc-network.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://impel-xdc-network.io/>Impel</a>, a spinoff of XinFin Fintech, which moves financial messages (ISO-20022), including cross-border payments, using the XDC Network.Wood is way less worried about CBDCs killing Bitcoin than I am. I have yet to find as big a worry wart on this issue as me. Granted, I have not turned over every leaf, or looked under every rock.

We will continue to see it being used as that, and probably for the long-term, especially as the monetary system continues to print more and more money causing inflation — even hyper inflation — as well as traditional currency devaluation. This should push Bitcoin to new all-time highs,” Wood says. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see countries using Bitcoin as a means of debt settlement amongst themselves before the decade is over.”Remember El Salvador’s “Bitcoin City”.“What has been called by international organizations as The B<a aria-label=itcoin class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw href=https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>itcoin</a> Experiment is nothing more than the world watching how mass adoption changes a country’s economy.

For the most part, the entire crypto industry is okay with regulation. As we have heard for years, it brings them legitimacy and kicks out the bad players. “Concrete regulations are necessary for the further development and adoption of cryptocurrencies across the world,” says Dennis Wohlfarth, CEO of Accointing. For those with an hour and a half to kill, Wohlfarth did a one and a half hour interview on crypto and taxes that you can <a aria-label=see here on YouTube. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD8SmeG2dOw&amp;t=1741s href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD8SmeG2dOw&amp;t=1741s rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD8SmeG2dOw&amp;t=1741s>see here on YouTube. </a> The interview was posted in March 2021 so it is still relatively fresh. There’s a caveat to all the regulation though. It has to be done in cahoots with industry experts, and not a one side affair, Wohlfarth says.History is full of moments when centralized authorities wanted to exert total control over something that everyday people preferred as-is. Their rate of success in these situations is thin. “It does not favor central authorities,” Dobrovitsky says.Bitcoin and other decentralized systems preserve privacy. The Powers that Be don’t need to ring fence you in Russia because you’re driving a gas guzzler, though they would love to dish out that kind of punishment. I mean, who’s with me on that one? Privacy is something most of us still agree on. Other than our crying videos on TikTok, in general, the average person likes privacy. Moreover, Bitcoin doesn’t really have an issue with inflation because the coins created have a set supply. There’s no politicized bureaucracy that probably hates half of you for whatever reason.“Bitcoin is not susceptible to corruption within any government as it is not controlled by a central government,” says Dobrovitsky.That’s what real Bitcoin fans love about Bitcoin, but as it becomes more mainstream, do most people holding Bitcoin in their Gemini wallet even know the difference between centralized and decentralization? My guess is no. My guess is the BIS and other central banks are counting on that and can turn people off to Bitcoin. How many is anybody’s guess. But my hunch is we might find more clues to this question in 2022.<em>***The writer of this article owns Bitcoin and Algorand.***</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I write about global business trends, big business dramas and investing, primarily in emerging markets.

Dec 28 2021 07:18am,"Gold colored Bitcoin symbol sitting inside of 2021 on yellow financial graph background. <em>With reporting from Michael del Castillo, Javier Paz, Nina Bambysheva and Marie Schulte-Bockum</em>In a year crypto’s market cap hit $3 trillion, the SEC approved its first bitcoin ETF and NFT fever pushed digital doodles to million dollar values, crypto is finally going mainstream.   Here are six metrics that defined crypto in 2021 and what they mean for the coming year.The estimated portion of gold’s $11 trillion market cap reached by Bitcoin at the height of its bull run on November 10th, 2021. On that date, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,721, representing a 120% surge for the year and a nearly $3 trillion market cap.  Three years ago bitcoin’s total market cap amounted to approximately 2.8% of gold’s. Still, bitcoin was far from the best performing crypto asset in 2021. Ethereum, a multipurpose platform that can process any type of transaction is up 443% since last year, and it has even gotten lapped by many competitors as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). <em>For more in-depth news and analysis of the dynamic and emerging crypto markets, subscribe to our premium research publication, </em><a aria-label=Forbes CryptoAsset and Blockchain Advisor class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?sh=51cd6af3dec8 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?sh=51cd6af3dec8 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?sh=51cd6af3dec8><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?sh=51cd6af3dec8><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?sh=51cd6af3dec8>Forbes CryptoAsset and Blockchain Advisor</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong>That said, while bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ narrative has found a receptive audience, as its surge coincided with record levels of inflation, it still trades wildly which makes it largely untouchable for anyone seeking sleep-well-at-night safety in their asset purchases. With the Fed looking to accelerate its tapering schedule in response to November’s price increases of 6.8%, the highest in 40 years, bitcoin will need to find a new value proposition that does not rely on the crutch of easy money coming out of Washington.Bitcoin and Ethereum fared much better than gold in 2021The estimated yearly energy consumption of Bitcoin miners, 123.02 terawatt-hours (TW/h), a measure of electrical energy. According to the Cambridge University Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which maintains a model used to track electricity usage, this is approximately the same amount of energy used by Argentina, Colombia, Norway, Sweden, and Ukraine in a given year. As Bitcoin rose in price this year, hash rate (the amount of computing power on the network) dramatically increased to set numerous all-time highs in the spring. As you can see in the chart below, the hash rate underwent a substantial drop following China’s exile of its entire mining industry over the summer. However, the network has regained those losses and is poised for more growth. Additionally, top miners are planning on adding hundreds of thousands of new machines in 2022, so this is just the beginning. Bitcoin’s carbon footprint is bound to grow as key parties reject a switch to more energy friendly alternatives due to concerns about weaker security or centralization of the network, which are critical to Bitcoin’s value proposition.

Founded in 2017 and 2021 respectively, CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club monkeys are ‘pfp’ collections, meaning holders like to display their punk or ape as their profile picture or avatar. You may have seen one of the 10,000 available CryptoPunks or BAYC apes as a Twitter avatar, Gmail icon, Facebook profile picture, or even as a LinkedIn headshot. In the NFT world, the “floor price” for NFTs (non-fungible tokens) is exactly what it sounds like: the lowest price to buy that class of assets. Most sales for one of the oldest and most revered collections of NFTs, CryptoPunks, surpass this number as well. Floor prices, perhaps even more than the digital artist Beeple selling a work of art for a staggering $69 million, encapsulates what has been a white hot 2021 for the NFT market. Moving into 2021, NFTs are bound to become even more mainstream, as prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, FTX, Crypto.com, and Blockchain.com launch their own marketplaces. That said, overall success will also require finding ways to make them more accessible to everyday investors, who make up 80% of all NFT purchasers, that cannot afford six, seven, or eight-figure outlays.  The total amount of funding cryptocurrency companies have raised from venture capitalists in 2021, more than the 10 previous years <em>combined. </em> Additionally, almost all of the the 10 largest investment rounds this year, which brought in over $6.3 billion, were the industry’s largest <em>ever </em>at the time of close.

Leading the pack was Epic Games, which earlier in the year hauled in $1 billion to ensure its games weren’t displaced by open-source competitors built on top of blockchains. According to venture capital data site Crunchbase more than 700 metaverse-related deals closed this year in fields as diverse as online gaming and augmented reality (there was likely some overlap with blockchain as well). In April Forbes sold the first NFT magazine cover for $333,333. Called Masters of the Metaverse, the cover depicted Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who later raised $400 million to build out their cryptocurrency exchange, and invest in a number of metaverse-related projects. The metaverse is bound to be one of the hottest topics in 2022, as Google search interest for the term is up 1,000% in the last couple of months and prominent tokens tied to the vertical such as AXS, MANA, and SAND, see record growth. That said, real questions will need to be answered such as when users will see utility and if the metaverse really needs a blockchain. Keanu Reeves expressed the feelings of many cryptopians when Facebook announced its Meta rebrand, saying in an interview with The Verge, “Can we just not have metaverse be like invented by Facebook.Metaverse search interest soared at the end of 2021The surge in open interest (OI), i.e. the amount of unsettled contracts at the CME, so far during Q4 this year. Despite the continuation of 2020’s bull run through the early part of 2021,  OI turned negative in the spring as institutions pared back some of their bets. The launches of ether futures and then micro bitcoin futures did little to boost new OI growth. Nine months into 2021, crypto OI was down 14%. But then came Q4. The major catalyst was the U.S. SEC’s approval of bitcoin futures ETFs, which traded solely at the CME. The dollar value of CME crypto futures reached ~$4.7 billion daily in October 2021, a 783% year-on-year volume, and temporarily made the CME the largest crypto derivatives exchange in the world. Following the launch of the three bitcoin ETFs, the CME’s crypto OI was now up 12% from its record 2020, and the dollar value of these contracts had grown by 351% to $5 billion. With this momentum, the CME is riding high into 2022. However, it is expecting a much more crowded competitive landscape in 2021, and some of its ‘monopolistic’ positioning could be dented if the SEC approves a long-awaited spot ETF next year. The launch of bitcoin futures in October drove demand for contracts offered by the CME<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am director of research for digital assets at Forbes.

</fbs-ticker> suite of products — to allowing for organizational control of different emails and releasing its own VPN product.The company has been renamed to Proton, to adjust for its broader focus on privacy-enhancing tools outside of email. What follows are excerpts from my interview with Andy on his thoughts about encryption, bitcoin — and the enduring importance of privacy. The questions and responses have been excerpted from a larger interview, and written out in a way that is more reader-friendly and focused, though the substance is there: the content of the answers matches almost exactly those in the full interview save a few formatting edits and changing the order of one question. <strong>Proton is structured in an interesting way from ProtonMail to ProtonVPN —what do you see as the full privacy stack of tools which can maximize encryption and minimize surveillance? How do you see Proton interacting with other privacy tools such as bitcoin and Signal? </strong>As a business, we’re shifting from a single privacy product, ProtonMail to Proton as a privacy platform, privacy ecosystem — as a privacy infrastructure for the future. Obviously when you think about privacy online, email is an important part because it is an identity — many people say that it is the only identity that matters today, but it is still limited and that is why we introduced ProtonVPN to allow facility and access to ProtonMail services, that’s why we’re doing a calendar and drive. We’ll be expanding on that ecosystem of course. The way to really consider this is, in fact, all services that Google offers today are built and designed in a way to maximize the data they can collect in order to sell better advertising. You could take all of those products and services and rebuild them in a way that is centred around making privacy the default and being as private and as secure as possible. In fact, there’s nothing that Google offers that couldn’t be rebuilt in a better way, and that whole ecosystem could in fact be recreated in a privacy-first way. And what you do see is different companies, different startups starting to pick up different pieces of that. Obviously, we have the email, VPN, file storage and calendar piece that we’re working on. DuckDuckGo is doing that on search. Signal and Telegram are adjusting this when it comes to chat. I think it’s a very healthy and vibrant fact that we have an ecosystem today where there’s many companies in the space, and it becomes increasingly possible to replace more and more pieces of your online life with private versions of [products].Blockchain is another element there. We’ve been long-time supporters of bitcoin from the very beginning. [...] It’s a means of independence. For the space to survive, for privacy to thrive, you need to be able to be independent. You need to be not under the control of let’s say, big tech or even the banking system. This level of independence really needs to be there to be in order for you to really do what is best for users at all times. This is why we also support cryptocurrencies and we support it as a payment method. I personally would like to see more adoption of cryptocurrencies, because I think that’s something that leads us to a world where things are less centralized. Centralization is a very very big risk because it means a single company can essentially cut you off and kill you. Resilient systems must be decentralized. We are building a platform or an ecosystem, but we are working as much as possible to be part of a broader ecosystem because we know we can’t do it alone.(<a aria-label=Paypal once restricted ProtonMail’s account class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://protonmail.com/blog/paypal-freezes-protonmail-campaign-funds/ href=https://protonmail.com/blog/paypal-freezes-protonmail-campaign-funds/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://protonmail.com/blog/paypal-freezes-protonmail-campaign-funds/>Paypal once restricted ProtonMail’s account</a>, with one representative questioning if the service was even legal).<strong>You’ve spoken and </strong><a aria-label=written often class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://protonmail.com/blog/big-tech-congress/ href=https://protonmail.com/blog/big-tech-congress/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://protonmail.com/blog/big-tech-congress/><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://protonmail.com/blog/big-tech-congress/>written often</strong></a><strong> about the negative effects of big tech monopolies. What are your thoughts on the acquisitions in the space — something I’ve been seeing in the space for example with Zoom acquiring Keybase. </strong>There are acquisitions within the privacy space — the Zoom/Keybase acquisition was a very specific one — it was to try to repair the security and privacy reputation [of Zoom] that took quite a big hit last year. From the perspective of Proton, our business model doesn’t allow us to be acquired by Google and become part of big tech. It simply isn’t possible, it would undermine our value proposition and I think if you are building businesses in privacy that is something to keep in mind.Very so often, a lot of people start companies solely for the purpose of selling them, and the usual buyers in the past were big tech. That avenue isn’t possible for privacy companies — and I think that is a good thing, because if it were possible, then big tech would just own everything and you would have a competition issue. <strong>What about the pricing (for example app store fees) and talent effects of big tech monopolies?</strong>The things that Apple and Google are doing on the app store clearly are anti-competitive in many ways. You cannot have a fair competition if you are mandated by your competitor to pay them 30% of your revenue. There is no market, historical or future, where fair competition can exist under those circumstances. This should be very obvious [...], it’s very obvious to us. It took quite a long time for lawmakers to realize that this is an issue and they’re starting to realize it’s a problem now and that’s why we’re seeing action on both sides of the Atlantic to pursue that. [...]It’s also very bad for privacy, because if you look at the advertising business model, they don’t charge for their product. The way that they work is that you get the product for free and they’ll monetize you off of your data and using your most intimate and sensitive information to basically sell you ads. A service like Facebook, honestly, would never have the payback fee — but assume there was a more responsible version of Facebook that was going to subsist off of subscriptions instead of massive data abuse. That service would because of app store policies be put at a competitive disadvantage. They’d have to pay fees that the bad business models don’t have to pay. What the app store fees are essentially doing is strongly favouring ads-based business models which are bad for privacy — and through that way, consumers around the world are harmed as a result of this. [...]On talent, it’s an interesting question — big tech because of their size sucks up a lot of the talent in the tech sector. But I believe what we’ve been seeing in the last year or last two years has been the rise of employee activism in that employees care of course about making a paycheck [...] but there’s also more and more people [...] who also care about what they’re doing in their life. [...] If you care about those things, and there are bigger and bigger proportion of people these days, especially young people, then you ask yourself the question: do I want to spend my life working at the world’s biggest ad company, and abuse data to optimize ad returns? Or do I actually want to build the Internet of the future that defends democracy, defends human rights and ensures freedom for all?—-It has been an interesting year for Proton, which has seen it launch new products, and continue building as part of a privacy ecosystem — a place where parts of the Internet, including cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and the broader encryption ecosystem are gradually building towards.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I was one of the first writers in 2014 to write about the intersection of cryptocurrencies in remittance payments and drug policy with VentureBeat and TechCrunch.

Ethereum's two other major rivals, <strong>cardano</strong> and <strong>polkadot</strong>, are leading the major market higher this morning, up 9% and 6% respectively over the last 24 hours.<strong>Now read this: </strong><a aria-label=Why portfolio managers will need to look at altcoins in 2022 class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/eb2a3db5?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY3YyIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbVwvbWFya2V0c1wvMjAyMVwvMTJcLzI2XC93aHktcG9ydGZvbGlvLW1hbmFnZXJzLXdpbGwtbmVlZC10by1sb29rLWF0LWFsdGNvaW5zLWluLTIwMjJcLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=XXw4A8DZQEGdPxCYKNz95kRQsgeEZY6qx99Qyi28Vgg href=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/eb2a3db5?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY3YyIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbVwvbWFya2V0c1wvMjAyMVwvMTJcLzI2XC93aHktcG9ydGZvbGlvLW1hbmFnZXJzLXdpbGwtbmVlZC10by1sb29rLWF0LWFsdGNvaW5zLWluLTIwMjJcLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=XXw4A8DZQEGdPxCYKNz95kRQsgeEZY6qx99Qyi28Vgg target=_self title=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/eb2a3db5?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY3YyIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbVwvbWFya2V0c1wvMjAyMVwvMTJcLzI2XC93aHktcG9ydGZvbGlvLW1hbmFnZXJzLXdpbGwtbmVlZC10by1sb29rLWF0LWFsdGNvaW5zLWluLTIwMjJcLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=XXw4A8DZQEGdPxCYKNz95kRQsgeEZY6qx99Qyi28Vgg>Why portfolio managers will need to look at altcoins in 2022</a>Blockbuster's video rental business collapsed due to the rise of streaming services.<strong>DAO it:</strong> After the runaway success (<a aria-label=and ultimate failure class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/740edc70?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY3ZiIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tXC8yMDIxXC8xMVwvMThcL2NvbnN0aXR1dGlvbmRhby1jcnlwdG8taW52ZXN0b3JzLWxvc2UtYmlkLXRvLWJ1eS1jb25zdGl0dXRpb24tY29weS5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=UZDdHBB3Wl0Hub9MA1r73t23CyrgsmxoGYPqPnLA7EA href=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/740edc70?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY3ZiIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tXC8yMDIxXC8xMVwvMThcL2NvbnN0aXR1dGlvbmRhby1jcnlwdG8taW52ZXN0b3JzLWxvc2UtYmlkLXRvLWJ1eS1jb25zdGl0dXRpb24tY29weS5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=UZDdHBB3Wl0Hub9MA1r73t23CyrgsmxoGYPqPnLA7EA target=_self title=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/740edc70?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY3ZiIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tXC8yMDIxXC8xMVwvMThcL2NvbnN0aXR1dGlvbmRhby1jcnlwdG8taW52ZXN0b3JzLWxvc2UtYmlkLXRvLWJ1eS1jb25zdGl0dXRpb24tY29weS5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=UZDdHBB3Wl0Hub9MA1r73t23CyrgsmxoGYPqPnLA7EA>and ultimate failure</a>) of the ConstitutionDAO—a group that raised money to try to buy one of the original copies of the U.S. Constitution at auction—crypto enthusiasts are keen to see if other projects can be realized using decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).<strong>What's a DAO anyway?</strong> Using the same blockchain technology that allows the decentralization of cryptocurrencies, a group of developers came up with the idea for DAOs in 2016. While bitcoin or some other cryptocurrencies could be considered DAOs, they're generally created with an explicit purpose or shared goal in mind. A DAO's rules are recorded on a blockchain, with participants able to make and vote on proposals. The rule-based software eliminates the need for a leader or central authority and some have suggested companies or even governments could become DAOs to better serve the need of shareholders, governments or members.<strong>DeFi to DeFilm: </strong>The latest viral DAO idea comes from a group that says it wants to build a DAO to buy the Blockbuster name from its current owner, Dish, and turn it into the first DeFilm studio and streaming platform. The DeFilm name is an evolution of DeFi, which stands for decentralized finance and uses crypto technology to reimage traditional financial services.<strong>Freedom fighters: </strong>Our mission is to liberate Blockbuster and form a DAO to collectively govern the brand as we turn Blockbuster into the first-ever DeFilm streaming platform and a mainstay of both the web3 brands and products, but a powerhouse in the future of the film industry, the group <a aria-label=posted to Twitter class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/fcc21e7d?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MCIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvdHdpdHRlci5jb21cL0Jsb2NrYnVzdGVyREFPXC9zdGF0dXNcLzE0NzQ5NjAzNzMyOTE3NDkzNzg_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXRrJmNkbGNpZD01ZDY3ZTAxZjE5NTA2M2ZhNGY2NTM0MWEifQ&amp;jwtS=79yrweCGmcpE1qz0YE_yrRRdBGNvpy1-jFVC4mYSZaI href=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/fcc21e7d?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MCIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvdHdpdHRlci5jb21cL0Jsb2NrYnVzdGVyREFPXC9zdGF0dXNcLzE0NzQ5NjAzNzMyOTE3NDkzNzg_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXRrJmNkbGNpZD01ZDY3ZTAxZjE5NTA2M2ZhNGY2NTM0MWEifQ&amp;jwtS=79yrweCGmcpE1qz0YE_yrRRdBGNvpy1-jFVC4mYSZaI target=_self title=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/fcc21e7d?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MCIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvdHdpdHRlci5jb21cL0Jsb2NrYnVzdGVyREFPXC9zdGF0dXNcLzE0NzQ5NjAzNzMyOTE3NDkzNzg_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXRrJmNkbGNpZD01ZDY3ZTAxZjE5NTA2M2ZhNGY2NTM0MWEifQ&amp;jwtS=79yrweCGmcpE1qz0YE_yrRRdBGNvpy1-jFVC4mYSZaI>posted to Twitter</a>, calling for incredible people to join this project.<strong>Now read this:</strong> <a aria-label=From a meme to $47 million—ConstitutionDAO, crypto, and the future of crowdfunding class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/a1ecd0c0?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MSIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbVwvMjI4MjA1NjNcL2NvbnN0aXR1dGlvbi1tZW1lLTQ3LW1pbGxpb24tY3J5cHRvLWNyb3dkZnVuZGluZy1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNvbnN0aXR1dGlvbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=lUhUY-iM2SKJ9Jc0IqAP0NZGjrBhuOs-jBJXHlc4Bh8 href=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/a1ecd0c0?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MSIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbVwvMjI4MjA1NjNcL2NvbnN0aXR1dGlvbi1tZW1lLTQ3LW1pbGxpb24tY3J5cHRvLWNyb3dkZnVuZGluZy1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNvbnN0aXR1dGlvbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=lUhUY-iM2SKJ9Jc0IqAP0NZGjrBhuOs-jBJXHlc4Bh8 target=_self title=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/a1ecd0c0?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MSIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbVwvMjI4MjA1NjNcL2NvbnN0aXR1dGlvbi1tZW1lLTQ3LW1pbGxpb24tY3J5cHRvLWNyb3dkZnVuZGluZy1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNvbnN0aXR1dGlvbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGsmY2RsY2lkPTVkNjdlMDFmMTk1MDYzZmE0ZjY1MzQxYSJ9&amp;jwtS=lUhUY-iM2SKJ9Jc0IqAP0NZGjrBhuOs-jBJXHlc4Bh8>From a meme to $47 million—ConstitutionDAO, crypto, and the future of crowdfunding</a>👀 Watch out for these cryptocurrency and crypto-related events this week.🎅 Traders are still hoping Christmas cheer will deliver a late Santa rally.

Adams has called for schools to add cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to the curriculum and said he'll take his first three paychecks in bitcoin, setting NYC up for a showdown with Miami as the most crypto-friendly U.S. city.<strong>Now read this:</strong> <a aria-label=Crypto keeps burrowing into the mainstream class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/47a5b04f?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MyIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3Lndzai5jb21cL2FydGljbGVzXC9uZnRzLWFuZC1zbmwtY3J5cHRvLWtlZXBzLWJ1cnJvd2luZy1pbnRvLXRoZS1tYWluc3RyZWFtLTExNjQwNTY3NDIzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=-rMmIoNfANN3fohJJ53B2fHxyx_66Qk2HydUGYOf33U href=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/47a5b04f?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MyIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3Lndzai5jb21cL2FydGljbGVzXC9uZnRzLWFuZC1zbmwtY3J5cHRvLWtlZXBzLWJ1cnJvd2luZy1pbnRvLXRoZS1tYWluc3RyZWFtLTExNjQwNTY3NDIzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=-rMmIoNfANN3fohJJ53B2fHxyx_66Qk2HydUGYOf33U target=_self title=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112271235:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/47a5b04f?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2NDA2MDg2NjAsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYzliMzQ3Y2NkZDliMjg0ZTE5NGY4MyIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3Lndzai5jb21cL2FydGljbGVzXC9uZnRzLWFuZC1zbmwtY3J5cHRvLWtlZXBzLWJ1cnJvd2luZy1pbnRvLXRoZS1tYWluc3RyZWFtLTExNjQwNTY3NDIzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=-rMmIoNfANN3fohJJ53B2fHxyx_66Qk2HydUGYOf33U>Crypto keeps burrowing into the mainstream</a><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Mar 6 2022 06:45am ,"SAN FRANCISCO - FEBRUARY 25: People walk by a window sticker advertising Visa and MasterCard credit <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> cards. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</span>Spending your cryptocurrency was once a headache-inducing endeavour. Not only did few merchants accept bitcoin as a medium of exchange, but without access to the now ubiquitous fiat off-ramps, you had to source a buyer willing to exchange fiat for digital. That entailed a degree of risk since peer-to-peer marketplaces that protected users with an escrow system didn't exist.What a difference a couple of years makes. These days it’s easy to use bitcoin and ether to buy goods and services online, in the metaverse, and in the meatspace, with payment gateways handling conversion at the point of sale. The spender authorizes the transaction while the processor converts their crypto into fiat in real time, de-risking the transaction for merchants sceptical of accepting volatile virtual currencies. Everyone’s a winner.Of all the infrastructure put in place since the emergence of the digital asset sector, few have done as much to accelerate mainstream adoption as crypto-friendly debit cards. Payment giants Visa and Mastercard have rolled out support for cryptocurrencies on their vast networks, giving users access to their crypto portfolios and the ability to quickly and cheaply convert them into traditional currencies for spending purposes.This is not a globally acceptable solution as many countries take a hard line stance against cryptocurrencies, with financial laws in place that ban citizens from buying, selling or even holding them. A crypto-fiat card, convenient as it may be, won’t be of much use in <a aria-label=Algeria class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/algeria/ href=https://freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/algeria/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/algeria/>Algeria</a> or Bolivia. But in countries where Visa and Mastercard are accepted, your purchase power is assured.Explaining its shifting attitude towards the digital economy earlier this year, Mastercard <a aria-label=wrote class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/ href=https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/>wrote</a> that it “isn’t here to recommend you start using cryptocurrencies. But we are here to enable customers, merchants and businesses to move digital value, traditional or crypto, however they want. It should be your choice, it’s your money.”Mastercard’s growing crypto partner network now includes wallet application Wirex, bitcoin payment service provider BitPay, digital asset manager Bakkt, and FDIC-insured mobile banking application LVL. Last week, the company<a aria-label=announced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/ava-labs-among-startups-chosen-for-mastercards-crypto-accelerator-program/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/ava-labs-among-startups-chosen-for-mastercards-crypto-accelerator-program/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/ava-labs-among-startups-chosen-for-mastercards-crypto-accelerator-program/> announced</a> that it was also joining forces with five startups to solve global blockchain challenges” as part of its Start Path Crypto accelerator program.As well as LVL, the companies participating in the program include smart-contract builder Ava Labs, AI-centric mobile banking app Envel, peer-to-peer savings platform Kash, and crypto rewards platform NiftyKey. Three more leading cryptocurrency service providers in the Asia Pacific region, Amber, Bitkub and CoinJar, will <a aria-label=soon be launching class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2021/november/mastercard-partners-with-leading-digital-currency-companies-across-asia-pacific-to-launch-the-region-s-first-crypto-linked-payment-cards/ href=https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2021/november/mastercard-partners-with-leading-digital-currency-companies-across-asia-pacific-to-launch-the-region-s-first-crypto-linked-payment-cards/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2021/november/mastercard-partners-with-leading-digital-currency-companies-across-asia-pacific-to-launch-the-region-s-first-crypto-linked-payment-cards/>soon be launching</a> crypto-funded Mastercard payment cards.Visa has embraced digital assets with an equal fervour, having teamed up with over 60 crypto platforms including Circle, BlockFi, Coinbase, FTX and Anchorage. The firm even <a aria-label=launched class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.visa.co.uk/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.3149494.html href=https://www.visa.co.uk/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.3149494.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.visa.co.uk/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.3149494.html>launched</a> its own Global Crypto Advisory Practice last year, pitched at financial institutions keen to win or retain customers by expanding their services to include digital currencies, stablecoins, and NFTs.Much of Visa’s crypto business has been conducted in concert with payments startup <a aria-label=Simplex class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.simplex.com/ href=https://www.simplex.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.simplex.com/>Simplex</a>, which specializes in providing users with on and off-ramp capabilities via both credit and debit cards. Simplex was this year acquired by Canadian payments processor Nuvei in a deal worth $250 million, and Nuvei is in turn <a aria-label=rolling out branded Visa cards class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvei-visa-join-forces-launch-150000678.html href=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvei-visa-join-forces-launch-150000678.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvei-visa-join-forces-launch-150000678.html>rolling out branded Visa cards</a> to its partners throughout Europe. There clearly are many different entities responsible for giving crypto more purchase power.By enabling millions of consumers around the world to spend digital assets with a swipe of the card or smartphone, two non-crypto native firms have struck a surprising blow to the hegemony of traditional financial institutions when it comes to payments. The dominance of traditional players in the payment space has been waning for some time as innovative forms of digital payment have emerged. Square’s <a aria-label=Cash App class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://cash.app/ href=https://cash.app/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://cash.app/>Cash App</a> boasts over 40 million monthly active users and digital wallets like Venmo, Revolut, and Wirex have also built large international user bases.Many alternative payment platforms continue to allow users to fund their accounts through connecting their bank accounts. Crypto-friendly debit cards, for example, often display a fiat balance <em>and </em>crypto balance with account-holders able to shift funds accordingly and spend either fiat or crypto at the point of sale. In the future banks could be frozen out altogether. Stablecoins, a digital asset whose value is pegged 1:1 with the US dollar are now being supported on cards. Like other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins can be spent like cash anywhere Visa and Mastercard is accepted with cards such as the one <a aria-label=offered class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/mastercard-voyager-team-to-make-usdc-stablecoin-spendable-and-mainstream/ href=https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/mastercard-voyager-team-to-make-usdc-stablecoin-spendable-and-mainstream/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/mastercard-voyager-team-to-make-usdc-stablecoin-spendable-and-mainstream/>offered</a> by crypto platform Voyager Digital, which supports the USDC stablecoin. If many crypto users are only interacting with the legacy fiat system because of its supposed stability, they could turn their banks on fiat entirely by using assets like USDC and USDT as a kind of proxy fiat.There is another benefit of stabelcoins as cryptoassets like <a aria-label=bitcoin class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coinlore.com/coin/bitcoin href=https://www.coinlore.com/coin/bitcoin rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coinlore.com/coin/bitcoin>bitcoin</a> often come with a capital gain tax burden, when converted into cash and spent. Stablecoins are better suited to being a medium of exchange.The debit cards offered by major crypto-native platforms such as Coinbase and Crypto.com, all in partnership with Visa, allow users to spend their trading profits (including those made from selling NFTs) and earn perks such as cashback to inspire loyalty. <a aria-label=Crypto.com's class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:http://crypto.com href=http://crypto.com rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=http://crypto.com>Crypto.com's</a> rewards also include free Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime and unlimited airport lounge access, with support for around 90 digital assets.Visa’s various industry partnerships meant that over $1 billion was spent on their crypto-friendly cards in the first half of 2021 alone. While that is a drop in the ocean to a company whose payment volume<a aria-label=totalled $8.8 trillion class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://annualreport.visa.com/financials/default.aspx href=https://annualreport.visa.com/financials/default.aspx rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://annualreport.visa.com/financials/default.aspx> totalled $8.8 trillion</a> last year, the number is only going up.“One thing that continues to put people off entering the space is the perceived difficulty of spending cryptocurrencies,” notes Shahaf Bar-Geffen, the CEO of fintech platform <a aria-label=COTI class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://coti.io/ href=https://coti.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://coti.io/>COTI</a>, “Banks are slow to adopt which causes issues, so a<a aria-label=debit card class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-bank-accounts-and-debit-cards-have-arrived-4e6bd7231352 href=https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-bank-accounts-and-debit-cards-have-arrived-4e6bd7231352 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-bank-accounts-and-debit-cards-have-arrived-4e6bd7231352> debit card</a> that’s connected directly to your crypto wallet, and accepted almost anywhere, is probably one of the easiest solutions to a crucial adoption problem.”Unlike many crypto platforms, COTI is built especially for payments. Its flagship COTI Pay product can process all payment types natively, both online and off, including crypto and stablecoins, credit cards, and even a merchant’s native coin. That said, it too has partnered with Simplex (and by extension, Visa) for its debit cards.It’s fair to say that crypto-friendly debit cards can offer greater functionality than their fiat equivalents, which for the most part operate solely as payment cards. As well as cashback, they often come with referral bonuses, rebates on different services and even in some cases, lines of credit. The latter feature is offered by wallet maker Ledger’s new Crypto Life card, which allows holders to obtain credit by using cryptocurrency as collateral. While such a thing is common in the burgeoning decentralized finance space, it’s the first time such infrastructure has been available via a card.The aptly named Crypto Life card will be available to customers in the U.K., France and Germany in the first quarter of 2022, and for US customers in the second quarter, with Ledger Chief Experience Officer Ian Rogers <a aria-label=stating class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/wallet-maker-ledger-launches-crypto-linked-debit-card-for-us-and-eu-customers/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/wallet-maker-ledger-launches-crypto-linked-debit-card-for-us-and-eu-customers/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/wallet-maker-ledger-launches-crypto-linked-debit-card-for-us-and-eu-customers/>stating</a> that it represents “a step toward replacing traditional bank accounts.”The gap between traditional finance and crypto is closing, and this can only be a good thing for consumers looking to get more bang for their bitcoin. The crypto debit card landscape is already crowded with competitors, expect the perks to get juicier and the number of supported digital assets to increase in the coming year.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I cover fintech, crypto and digital assets, and sustainable finance and investments, and promote policies for a transparent, secure, and quality digital financial future for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;>"

A $6 million bitcoin price, which has already climbed from around $4,000 in March 2020 to highs of almost $70,000 last month, would give the nearly 19 million bitcoins in circulation a combined value of $126 trillion—an increase of around 12,000% from its current near-$1 trillion market capitalization and making it by far the world's most valuable commodity. Saylor also said he personally owns 17,732 bitcoin, worth around $832 million at current prices, and has never sold any—however, he doesn't own any other cryptocurrency besides bitcoin <a aria-label=despite many climbing at a far faster clip than bitcoin over the last year class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/12/20/cryptocodex-as-the-price-of-bitcoin-and-ethereum-slide-these-two-cryptocurrencies-are-making-surprise-gains/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/12/20/cryptocodex-as-the-price-of-bitcoin-and-ethereum-slide-these-two-cryptocurrencies-are-making-surprise-gains/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/12/20/cryptocodex-as-the-price-of-bitcoin-and-ethereum-slide-these-two-cryptocurrencies-are-making-surprise-gains/>despite many climbing at a far faster clip than bitcoin over the last year</a>. I don’t believe you should sell your bitcoin, Saylor told <em>The Information</em>.MicroStrategy, after beginning to acquire bitcoin in August 2020, has now bought just over 122,000 bitcoins now worth almost $6 billion and is increasingly being run as two separate businesses. Right now, the strategy is we run the software business as hard as we can, Saylor said.

Dec 23 2021 04:15am,"<abbr class=drop-cap color-accent font-accent>C</abbr>ryptocurrencies were born to be volatile, says <a aria-label=Jihan Wu class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/profile/wu-jihan/?sh=4956c0aa2f69 href=https://www.forbes.com/profile/wu-jihan/?sh=4956c0aa2f69 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/profile/wu-jihan/?sh=4956c0aa2f69>Jihan Wu</a>, but their growth over the long term will far outweigh their price fluctuations. “Even if 95% of today’s coins lose all their value and disappear, the remaining 5% will grow massively,” he says.Wu’s optimism is borne of his experience. He discovered bitcoin and recognized its early promise more than a decade ago, when he saw it being used to buy computer hardware and IT services in online forums like <a aria-label=Bitcointalk.org class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcointalk.org/ href=https://bitcointalk.org/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcointalk.org/>Bitcointalk.org</a>. But to break out of its niche market and gain wider acceptance, bitcoin would need far more infrastructure to support it. So, Wu began working on a solution that would play a vital role in bitcoin’s development.In 2013, Wu teamed up with Micree Ketuan Zhan to launch <a aria-label=Bitmain Technologies class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitmain.com/ href=https://www.bitmain.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitmain.com/>Bitmain Technologies</a>, a supplier of specialized hardware known as mining rigs which are designed for the single task of adding transactions to bitcoin’s blockchain. The people who own the hardware earn, or mine, new bitcoins by making their processing power available to the network.As bitcoin’s price rose over the years, Bitmain’s mining rigs became a runaway success, and it turned both Wu and Zhan into billionaires. By 2018, Bitmain had become the world’s largest supplier of cryptocurrency mining rigs with a market share of 75%, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan. And the Beijing-based company was preparing for a multibillion-dollar public listing in Hong Kong—until bitcoin crashed, losing 70% of its value by the end of that same year. Bitmain's booth attracts the attention of visitors to the 4th Digital China Summit at the Fuzhou Strait International Conference and Exhibition Center on April 25, 2021 in Fuzhou, Fujian Province of China.Bitmain’s IPO became a casualty of bitcoin’s volatility and placed a heavy strain on the company’s finances. And the two cofounders were quickly thrust into a scramble for survival that later evolved into a struggle for control of the company.Today, Wu looks back at bitcoin’s twists and turns as milestones on his entrepreneurial journey toward building one of the world’s largest crypto business empires. Bitmain has since returned to profitability, according to Wu, and continues to dominate the global market for mining rigs from its headquarters in Beijing in spite of China’s recent crackdown on crypto mining and trading. In response to the new restrictions, the company <a aria-label=ceased shipments class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitmain.com/news-detail/bitmain-develops-carbon-neutral-strategy-while-improving-plans-for-enhanced-chip-development-162 href=https://www.bitmain.com/news-detail/bitmain-develops-carbon-neutral-strategy-while-improving-plans-for-enhanced-chip-development-162 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitmain.com/news-detail/bitmain-develops-carbon-neutral-strategy-while-improving-plans-for-enhanced-chip-development-162>ceased shipments</a> to its clients in mainland China, although overseas customers are said to be unaffected. Bitmain is also building rigs that use less energy to address regulator’s concerns, but it did not elaborate on any further measures it intends to adopt. Wu stepped away from Bitmain at the beginning of the year to focus on his role as chairman of two spinoffs which are both based in Singapore—<a aria-label=Bitdeer Technologies class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitdeer.com/ href=https://www.bitdeer.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitdeer.com/>Bitdeer Technologies</a>, a cryptocurrency mining platform that’s already announced plans to list on the Nasdaq at a $4 billion valuation, and <a aria-label=Matrixport class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.matrixport.com/ href=https://www.matrixport.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.matrixport.com/>Matrixport</a>, a financial services firm valued at $1 billion in its latest funding round. Matrixport’s launch in February 2019 was another demonstration of Wu’s long-term optimism for the crypto industry. Bitcoin was still in a bear market when he and his fellow cofounder John Ge Yuesheng established their firm.“We believed that crypto and blockchain together would experience rapid growth in the future to tens of trillions of dollars,” Wu says. “And many of these new users will stay in the crypto market forever, so they’ll need advanced and sophisticated products to manage the wealth they accumulate in crypto assets.”<small>Data source: Bloomberg</small> Their decision to push ahead looks prescient now. Since Matrixport was launched, the overall market cap of cryptocurrencies shot up to an all-time high of $3 trillion in November, according to data from CoinGecko. And the global market size of crypto users has more than doubled to 221 million people in the first half of the year, according to a report from Crypto.com.Cryptocurrencies have been riding high this year on signs that digital assets are becoming more mainstream.

Wu’s track record of building multiple multi-billion dollar companies is nearly unparalleled, says Adam Goldberg, cofounder of Standard Crypto, a venture fund based in San Francisco. Goldberg, who was formerly with Lightspeed Venture Partners, became an investor in Bitmain around 2017, and later joined the board of Matrixport. “Jihan is a generational entrepreneur. He is uniquely agile, resilient, and always peeking around corners to preview the future of the crypto industry.” Matrixport’s name alludes to its aim of becoming a gateway or portal for investors to enter a new digital realm, much like in Wu’s favorite movie <em>The Matrix</em>. The firm’s strategy involves offering investment products like those found on Wall Street but tailored to crypto investors. Matrixport’s services include custody, trading, lending and structured products. Wu said they were the first to offer crypto dual currency products, which are investments that offer guaranteed yields with the payments settled in one of two possible cryptocurrencies depending on market prices at the time. The firm says it now has $10 billion in assets under management and custody and has more than $5 billion in average monthly trading volumes. Matrixport says it wants to double the number of users on its platform in 2022.Wu’s other venture, Bitdeer, is a mining platform that currently operates five pools in the U.S. and Norway with more than 100,000 mining units under its management.Bitdeer and Matrixport were both spun off from Bitmain as part of a settlement deal reached between Wu and Zhan after the two cofounders clashed. A nondisclosure agreement prevents Wu from speaking in detail about the terms of that deal, but he was able to discuss the circumstances that led to it with <em>Forbes Asia</em> for the first time. “That was a tough period for our business and for me. And of course, the pressures of running a complex manufacturing business built up and eventually led to a falling out between us two cofounders,” Wu recalls. Bitmain had rapidly gone from generating $2.5 billion in revenue in 2017, and a profit of $742 million in the first half of 2018, according to its prospectus filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange, to the point it was losing money and laying off swathes of staff.The company had ventured into a number of different areas during the boom time—AI, mining pool construction, a decentralized crypto exchange, venture capital, etc.—but many of those initiatives failed to turn a profit during the bear market of 2018, which came to be known as “crypto winter,” a deep selloff followed by a long period of flat trading. Buildings that hold bitcoin mining units at a facility that had been operated by Bitmain in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China.Bitmain’s two cofounders, who had previously worked together as co-CEOs, disagreed over its strategic direction and a power struggle ensued. The dispute became public at times until a deal was finally brokered at the end of last year that saw Wu step down as chairman and CEO of Bitmain, although he still retains a stake in the company. Zhan is now running Bitmain’s manufacturing operation and another mining pool called Antpool. “The settlement agreement marks the end of the hardship. Bitmain didn’t go bankrupt, instead it’s doing really well now,” Wu says. “Bitmain’s accumulated net profit is expected to reach between $2 billion and $4 billion. It’s a company that generates very high profits.”Wu’s path to crypto entrepreneurship began with his discovery of bitcoin when he was working as an investment analyst in Beijing. Having studied economics and psychology from Peking University, he instantly became engrossed by Satoshi Nakamoto’s idea for a decentralized digital currency. “The white paper he [Nakamoto] published in 2008 opened up a new world and offered an opportunity for new players like us to participate.” Wu said he immediately dropped his studies to become a certified accountant to instead focus on learning and then investing in bitcoin. After buying hundreds of coins himself in 2011, Wu invested in ASICMiner, a bitcoin mining company founded in 2012 by Jiang Xinyu, or <a aria-label=Friedcat class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=49840 href=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=49840 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=49840>Friedcat</a> as he was known in various online forums. The profits Wu gained from that deal was combined with capital from a group of other investors to start Bitmain in partnership with Zhan in 2013. Zhan was a chip designer who had been running his own business of making set-top boxes for televisions prior to teaming up with Wu. The two established Bitmain as one of the earliest manufacturers of the specialized chips used for mining cryptocurrencies known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. Wu’s initial aim was to be a VC investor behind Bitmain, but after committing his capital, he soon realized the heavy demands of running a tech startup required him to get involved in managing the company.Bitmain's ASIC mining units sit on a shelf inside a mining farm in Japan.In less than four years, Bitmain became the most influential company in the bitcoin economy. Bitmain’s vertical integration extended from designing the chips used in its mining rigs to assembling the hardware and selling them to customers around the world. At the same time, Bitmain was operating mining pools on contract to customers, as well as owning several of its own pools. Bitmain’s pools contributed about 37% of the aggregate processing power of the Bitcoin network by 2018. In spite of the regulatory uncertainty that characterizes cryptocurrencies in many of the world’s largest markets, Wu believes the industry will continue to develop unique innovations because it isn’t subjected to the constraints of the traditional financial system. “Innovations like DeFi [decentralized finance] are breathtaking” he says. “Technologies like crypto and blockchain have created a new world, allowing fintech entrepreneurs to make big achievements. Eventually, traditional financial institutions and regulators will embrace blockchain technology.”<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I'm a senior editor based in Hong Kong, covering Asia's business news.

The number of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges have increased across Istanbul as cryptocurrency investing continues to boom in Turkey.

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)</span>The news cycle is awash with supply chain problems and inflation. What had once been a niche academic concern seems to have reared itself into significant policy effects and narratives. Terms like the “Phillips Curve” and intricate cost curves on shipping have come to the fore as the world economy deals with aggressive monetary policy, unpredictable health policy, and fiscal stimulus paired with lockdowns. Is inflation “transitory” as a result of COVID-19? Or is it here to stay? What role does bitcoin have to play when it comes to inflation?The US-based media often only comments on inflation when it comes to an American political context. Seldom does the rest of the world get as much attention. One American inflation might be worth two or three hyperinflations elsewhere when it comes to the media cycle.And it isn’t just countries that are regularly cited as being profligate spenders or as hyperinflation examples such as Venezuela. Argentina, Lebanon, and Turkey are major economic powers that have been beset by life-altering inflation. This has changed the lives of many people: for example, in Argentina, long-known for its cultural love for fine cuts of beef, has seen residents report <a aria-label=they can no longer afford beef class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.thepigsite.com/news/2021/05/argentina-stops-meat-exports-for-30-days-due-to-inflation-fears href=https://www.thepigsite.com/news/2021/05/argentina-stops-meat-exports-for-30-days-due-to-inflation-fears rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.thepigsite.com/news/2021/05/argentina-stops-meat-exports-for-30-days-due-to-inflation-fears>they can no longer afford beef</a>.It’s important to recognize that we talk about inflation, even though it has global impacts, in the anglophone media cycle, the focus on inflation is often on the American context — where it hasn’t had nearly the effect as it has had around the world. Globally, the story of policy elites and central bankers getting the narrative wrong and causing economic suffering among the people is widespread. It is only now that the American narrative is starting to catch up for this generation’s version of that discussion. The United States has seen inflation rise recently and is a leader in terms of inflation growth between the third quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2021 per Pew Research. However, the world has seen <a aria-label=large average raises in 2008 and 2011 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG href=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG>large average raises in 2008 and 2011</a> in inflation rate: in that time period, the United States (and most developed nations) have seen <a aria-label=low inflation numbers class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/low-inflation-in-the-united-states-a-summary-of-recent-research-20151123.html href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/low-inflation-in-the-united-states-a-summary-of-recent-research-20151123.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/low-inflation-in-the-united-states-a-summary-of-recent-research-20151123.html>low inflation numbers</a>, the lowest among half a century from 2009 to 2014.In the meanwhile, Lebanon has approached famine, and there is lack of access to basics such as essential medicines due to the decimation of the Lebanese pound by inflation. Countries around the world are seeing highs in inflation, leading to political action and protests such as <a aria-label=Spanish protests class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2021/1218/Facing-pressure-to-act-on-inflation-governments-worldwide-respond href=https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2021/1218/Facing-pressure-to-act-on-inflation-governments-worldwide-respond rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2021/1218/Facing-pressure-to-act-on-inflation-governments-worldwide-respond>Spanish protests</a> for truckers against prohibitive fuel price increases — inflation is a global problem and as such, requires more of a global perspective — and has layers of context that go beyond an America-only focus. The greatest example of stagflation in the United States, a stagnating economy with high unemployment along with punishing inflation, surprised academics as well when it first emerged in the 1970s. The Phillips Curve, the relationship between employment wages and inflation, was first observed and fleshed out in 1958. In general terms, economists tend to see unemployment and inflation as a tradeoff: either low inflation and high unemployment or high inflation and low unemployment. Policy prescriptions and the “dual” mandate of the Federal Reserve and most central banks follows from this: ensure the economy is performing towards maximum employment while keeping inflation within a certain stable and low band. This analysis by the <a aria-label=Federal Reserve class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2020/05/01/is-the-phillips-curve-still-alive.pdf href=https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2020/05/01/is-the-phillips-curve-still-alive.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2020/05/01/is-the-phillips-curve-still-alive.pdf>Federal Reserve</a> talks about the different implications of the Phillips Curve when looked at different time horizons, including the trend that in the long term, high inflation seems to in turn “cause” high unemployment. Academics however disagree on whether the Phillips Curve is dormant with the recent curve down in inflation across the developed world, whether it is dead, or whether it is actually a functional relationship. This leads to a situation where depending on the time frame you look at and the country, you might get an entirely different response. This generation’s economists, raised in a low-inflation environment and the “need” for fiscal and monetary stimulus are gradually taking over the seats of those who were surprised (and had to reconfigure economics in its entirety) after a sustained period of high inflation and low employment. In practice, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks, through aggressive monetary stimulus, are acting as if the Phillips Curve is dead or at the very least strongly dormant — it remains to be seen if that’s the case. How much of the inflation being caused is because of supply chain issues that will pass away with the adjustment period to what has been incredible economic turmoil? Shipping prices for example <a aria-label=have nearly doubled class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/surging-shipping-costs-to-drive-consumer-price-inflation-unctad-says.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/surging-shipping-costs-to-drive-consumer-price-inflation-unctad-says.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/surging-shipping-costs-to-drive-consumer-price-inflation-unctad-says.html>have nearly doubled</a>, with ships stuck in ports and shortages of workers to unload a booming line of cargo. Yet, can we expect this to go down for exactly the “transitory” reasons often cited: that a surge of demand (especially holiday demand) from economies put back to life are driving prices and instability across the supply chain, but will soon stabilize into a “normalized” economy? Don’t count on it though: COVID-19 has shown an incredible ability to morph into new variants — even two years or so later, the default response from policy elites seems to be unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus to pair with broad shutdowns, whether culturally or legally mandated (as seen in Canada and Europe). Yet this level of analysis, which may already take us into the economic medium-term (2025 and beyond) needs to be also complemented by long-term considerations. Certain countries have seen their energy mix change radically — China, for example, became a net importer of aluminum partially after <a aria-label=energy mandates class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-metals-aluminium-ahome-idUSKBN2F51OB href=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-metals-aluminium-ahome-idUSKBN2F51OB rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-metals-aluminium-ahome-idUSKBN2F51OB>energy mandates</a> made it prohibitive to make aluminum in domestic borders — looking beyond temporary arbitrage, this is structural change to a key manufacturing component. There is also the idea of higher wages pushing towards higher levels of inflation, which is what the Phillips Curve is constructed around. All things equal, higher wage prices are correlated with higher inflation curves in the medium term. Most importantly, there is a global increase in money supply: in the United States, for example, M2 money supply (a measure of how much money is in circulation, with physical cash, cash equivalents, and liquid bank deposits accounted for, with the difference in M2 and M1 largely being small-denomination longer-term savings, and savings deposits) has accelerated dramatically due to the policy response to COVID-19. Over the long-term, a fairly robust association between the <a aria-label=growth of money supply and inflation holds class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/ href=https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/>growth of money supply and inflation holds</a>. It is this effect that bitcoin is most well-positioned to address and speaks to the longer-term time scale of the Phillips Curve: a world where policy responses that let inflation run hot eventually lead to a currency over-supply that naturally chases after fewer and fewer goods and an economy that is unresponsive to monetary stimulus — leading to stagflation — high unemployment, high inflation, and political unrest. Bitcoin is held up as an anti-inflation hedge. Yet, at a first glance, the research doesn’t seem to back that up. Bitcoin has recently, as a result of institutional investment, become rather <a aria-label=pro-cyclical class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-drops-below-46-000-144201583.html href=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-drops-below-46-000-144201583.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-drops-below-46-000-144201583.html>pro-cyclical</a> or aligned with broader market movements: if the market goes down, bitcoin tends to go down as well meaning that when news of inflation strikes, it’s not necessarily the case that bitcoin will perform like a pure hedge. After all, the markets will sink if there is news that there is inflation pending or happening in the United States, as it will probably weigh on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, and force a change in the policy interest rate or the posture of America’s central bank. If the policy rate goes up or if there is monetary tightening, then assets will go down in price — including bitcoin. Bitcoin’s role in hedging against inflation is more subtle than its immediate financial impact and needs to be separated according to different time scales like we decomposed the Phillips Curve. It is a philosophical, cultural and technological story rather than a financial one. Its principles of being an internationalized currency with no domestic polity and the idea of imposing strong technical constraints on controlling the monetary supply gives it clearer line of sight to the longer-term implications of Phillips Curve research: namely that monetary policy that leads to high inflation rates in the long-term ultimately end up creating the conditions for a terrible economy that will punish savers, low-income wage earners, and anybody who denominates their worth in fiat money. By calling attention to this, and focusing the attention of many, including retail-type investors, economic analysts and journalists on inflation, and keeping central banks accountable for the transparency they owe their peoples, bitcoin rallies people around understanding what goes into money supply and inflation, a wonkish conversation that technocrats may lean towards hiding through obscurity (as Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, mastered with “fed-speak”). It also sets the conditions to have a more permanent check on long-term inflationary and money supply growth factors — directly combating a principal source of what may be long-standing and established inflation.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I was one of the first writers in 2014 to write about the intersection of cryptocurrencies in remittance payments and drug policy with VentureBeat and TechCrunch.

Mar 5 2022 02:18pm ,"Getty Images Last Friday in my closing monologue on Market on Close, I outlined the deep bear case for bitcoin. It’s straightforward: rising interest rates should be King Crypto’s Achilles heel. Policy tightening from the Federal Reserve is exactly what crypto thought leaders have told us could never happen, and it’s happening. Coiners have been selling a story of central bank profligacy and ineptitude that is now being very precisely disproven as we speak. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is choosing to fight inflation at a more aggressive pace than just about anyone thought he would – or, in the case of bitcoiners, thought he could. As a result, the U.S. dollar is surging to the highest levels since the Covid crisis began. Telling the classic bitcoin story today amounts to telling something just short of a lie. As I said in my segment Friday, it looks to me like bitcoin is poised for a protracted decline. The logical flipside to this analysis is that if bitcoin is able to make a new record in a tightening monetary environment such as the one we’re in right now, then my assessment of bitcoin’s dependency on the Central Bank

</fbs-ticker> narrative is clearly wrong, and perhaps the asset has truly transcended into something more sustainable than a giant speculative bubble.For that lingering bull case, look to President Biden’s address on Tuesday, in which he justified the need for his Build Back Better plan by pointing out that stock prices dropped when Senator Manchin said he wasn’t on board with the White House agenda this past weekend. This is very dangerous logic that could refresh bitcoin’s narrative about a never-ending cycle of government spending that is more concerned with inflating asset prices than preserving economic stability.Using the most expensive stock market in history as an arbiter of what is good and true is like asking a drunk driver what the speed limit is. It’s a particularly backwards approach when we have ample evidence that the stock market over the past year has in many moments reacted negatively to events that are economically positive. Traders often use the phrase “bad is good” in describing the stock market’s reaction to positive economic news because of the implication that a strong economy means less stimulus. It’s not a meme – investors have been piling into the safety of Treasuries as the economy recovers because there is fear that the Fed’s tapering of support could crimp the economy.Unprecedented amounts of stimulus last year helped push stock prices to even higher valuations than the dot-com bubble and American wealth is more attached to risky investments like crypto than anything in recent history. It is asinine to think prices should only be allowed to move in one direction. Policymakers should be focused on disentangling asset prices from the economy, not crafting policy around what makes them go up the most. The more unsustainably expensive the market gets, the more its volatility will be generally unpredictable and detached from reason. It should not be the guidepost for what the economy needs.If this is the road we’re going down, bitcoiners will be the ones who got it right, and the ones who get it right are the ones who set the rules.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am the Lead Anchor at TD Ameritrade Network, and the host of Morning Trade Live and Market On Close.

Dorsey installed Parag Agrawal as the new chief executive of Twitter, previously the company's chief technology officer who has heen heavily involved in Twitter's decentralized technology projects.If I were not at Square or Twitter, I'd be working on bitcoin, Dorsey said at a Miami bitcoin conference in June. At the time, he said both companies have a role to play.

I can’t find it, Musk <a aria-label=tweeted class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473165759224463360 href=https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473165759224463360 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473165759224463360>tweeted</a>, with Dorsey replying: It’s somewhere between a and z—thought to be a reference to technology venture capital (VC) company Andreessen Horowitz that's recently invested billions in the development of web3.

The VCs and their [limited partners] do. It will never escape their incentives. It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label. Know what you’re getting into.Web3 hype has been boosted this year by the soaring price of some cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) designed to support its growth and the rebranding of Facebook to Meta.Just like NFTs, web3 and metaverse platforms are the next natural progression in how we interact, relate, and communicate with each other, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in <a aria-label=an interview class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/web3-metaverse-chat-with-mark-zuckerberg/ href=https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/web3-metaverse-chat-with-mark-zuckerberg/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/web3-metaverse-chat-with-mark-zuckerberg/>an interview</a> last month. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has surged higher, jumping shortly after Jack Dorsey's prediction that bitcoin <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> will replace the U.S. dollar, and boosting the ethereum price and other cryptocurrencies. </span>Bitcoin, created a little over a decade ago in response to the 2008 global financial crisis, has found a niche as digital gold, a scarce, decentralized, digital asset that some investors and even companies and countries have begun to hold as a store of value and hedge against inflation and risk.Last year, renowned investor Paul Tudor Jones opened investor flood gates when he named bitcoin as the fastest horse to beat the inflation he saw on the horizon as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and huge government money printing. Meanwhile, business intelligence software company MicroStrategy began adding bitcoin to its balance sheet, leading to Elon Musk's electric car company Tesla buying $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in January 2021. This year, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as its national currency alongside the U.S. dollar and began buying bitcoin. All of this has helped the bitcoin price soar from lows of around $4,000 per bitcoin in March 2020 to highs of $69,000 last month. The huge bitcoin price rally has though been outpaced by gains seen by other smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum and a handful of ethereum rivals, as well as so-called memecoins such as dogecoin and shiba inu.Last month, Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. presidential hopeful and secretary of state under president Barack Obama, <a aria-label=warned the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could undermine the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/21/undermining-the-dollar-hillary-clinton-issues-a-surprise-crypto-warning-as-the-bitcoin-price-suddenly-surges-back/?sh=3eab05794fd3 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/21/undermining-the-dollar-hillary-clinton-issues-a-surprise-crypto-warning-as-the-bitcoin-price-suddenly-surges-back/?sh=3eab05794fd3 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/11/21/undermining-the-dollar-hillary-clinton-issues-a-surprise-crypto-warning-as-the-bitcoin-price-suddenly-surges-back/?sh=3eab05794fd3>warned the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could undermine the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status</a>.However, others don't see bitcoin as ever replacing the dollar and other so-called fiat, government-backed currencies.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"2021 was the year, unarguably, that blockchain and cryptoassets moved from a fringe topic and emerging conversation to a mainstream idea and item that has moved to the mainstream financial markets conversation. That said, and even taking into account the rapid rise in market capitalization of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there is still substantial ambiguity surrounding the future of this sector. Even as regulatory and policy makers began to make substantial progress in both the understanding and treatment of cryptoassets, much ambiguity remains. Predicting the future is always a trick business, and is especially so when trying to forecast or predict a space that is moving as fast as blockchain and cryptoassets. GettyThat said, it is it the time of year for lists, predictions and forecasts, so let’s take a look at some of the things that might happen in 2022. <strong>NFTs will become boring.</strong> This might strike some readers as a bit of a reach, especially since there is so much that is misunderstood by the mainstream marketplace in terms of how non-fungible tokens (NFTs) operate and are valued. What is often missed in the current conversations around NFTs, and a direct result of the skyrocketing prices, is the true value and use case of NFTs. NFTs, at the truest form, represent digital proof of ownership that is secured by an underlying blockchain. Since increasing amounts of information and data – at both the individual and institutional level – are stored in a virtual format, it makes sense that securing these records will become a priority moving forward. Not as scintillating as watching prices for NFTs vacillate, but blockchain enabled ownership appears to be the future of NFTS for mainstream adoption. <strong>Stablecoins will be mainstream.</strong> Stablecoins, whether they are liked or not by all members of the crypto community, seem to be the most viable way in which non-expert and mass market adoption of crypto will commence. As per the report from the President’s Working Group, stablecoins utilization increased by 500% between October 2020 to October 2021, and it does not seem likely that this pace of adoption will decrease. The primary upside and attraction of stablecoins is the – unsurprisingly – stability that many of these cryptoassets offer, enabling crypto to be used as a transactional medium versus a speculative investment. As the calendar flips to 2022, and as geo-politics continues to influence and partially direct the cryptoasset conversation, the rise of stablecoins is a trend that cannot be ignored. Rather, and leading into the next point of conversation, is that stablecoins and other cryptoassets connected to external assets seem to represent the next iteration of mainstream crypto adoption. <strong>Crypto payments are here to stay</strong>. With the adoption of cryptoasset payments by major organizations such as PayPal 
 <fbs-ticker data-href=https://www.forbes.com/companies/paypal data-name=PYPL>
<a aria-label=PYPL class=ticker-link data-ga-track=Ticker:PYPL data-vars-event-label=ticker:PYPL href=https://www.forbes.com/companies/paypal rel=noopener noreferrer target=_blank>PYPL</a>

</fbs-ticker> during 2021, the trend toward cryptoassets being used for transactional purposes seems to be a permanent one. The technology underpinning the exiting aspects and applications in the marketplace – from decentralized finance (DeFi) to NFTs, has been proven to work time and again. The technology works, and the applications of said technology are just beginning to be acknowledged by the mainstream and non-expert marketplace. Stablecoins, if operated as advertised, offer an understandable and reasonably stable (no pun intended) way for individuals and institutions to get into the sector. Stablecoins might not be the favorite iteration of cryptocurrency by some members of the bitcoin community, but will serve a vital role moving forward. <strong>Bitcoin will hit 100k.</strong> This might seem like a relatively conservative estimate for the price of bitcoin in some circles, but it is worth noting that during 2021 the price of bitcoin did exhibit some of its historical volatility, ranging from lows around $30,000 to all-time-highs of nearly $70,000. Setting aside market volatility, and seeking to remain as objective as possible, the case for $100,000 bitcoin seems to have support points.Rising inflation, the continued monetary easing around the world and the proliferation of cryptoassets all point toward the following conclusion; cryptoassets are here to stay. What form or ultimate result that cryptoassets take remains uncertain at this point, but the integration of cryptoassets has already occurred. That said, and understanding the interest and appetite for growth oriented assets seems to point to an upward path for bitcoin and cryptoassets moving forward. If 2021 was the year that blockchain and cryptoassets became mainstream topic of conversation and analysis, the coming year seems well positioned to be the year that regulation and rules catch up to market realities. It is still too early and far too soon to predict just how the blockchain and cryptoasset sector will evolve, but the underlying trend is clear; these technologies have gone mainstream. No matter what price changes happen for specific tokens or coins, it is clear that the understanding and acceptance of cryptoassets is set to accelerate moving forward. Individuals, investors, and business owners would be well advised to keep an eye on this space as the calendar flips to 2022.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a professor at the City University of New York – Lehman College.

The top bitcoin holders control a greater share of the cryptocurrency than the most affluent American households control in dollars.<strong>Concentrated:</strong> Despite having been around for 14 years and the hype it has ratcheted up, it’s still the case that [bitcoin's] a very concentrated ecosystem, MIT Sloan School of Management finance professor Antoinette Schoar, who carried out the study along with Igor Makarov of the London School of Economics, told the <em>Journal</em>.<strong>Meanwhile...</strong> The amount of bitcoin held by miners is just 500 short of its all-time high, according to on-chain analytics company Glassnode. Miners are currently holding just under an all-time high of 1.778 million bitcoins, down from its peak 12 months ago. These coins are issued to miners as a reward for solving a block, but have never been spent on chain, Glassnode analysts said <a aria-label=via Twitter class=color-link

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, after proliferating during the last decade, have swollen to a massive $2 trillion market in recent years.The bitcoin price, having begun surging late last year from under $20,000 per bitcoin, reached a peak of almost $70,000 last month and helping the combined crypto market briefly touch $3 trillion. The price of ethereum and similar rivals have risen even faster than the bitcoin price as investors pile into the nascent market. Now, as bitcoin and crypto prices come under significant pressure in the face of a hawkish Federal Reserve, one academic has warned cryptocurrency lit a fire under central banks—even as bitcoin itself may not survive. <a aria-label=Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>Sign up now for the free <em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A daily newsletter for the crypto-curious.

</fbs-ticker>, now rebranded as Meta, announced it planned to launch a bitcoin-inspired private digital currency, then called libra. Governments and lawmakers balked at Facebook's plans to become a global currency issuer, however, legislating Facebook's crypto ambitions out of existence. This year, the Central American country of El Salvador has formally adopted bitcoin as its national currency alongside the U.S. dollar and has begun buying up huge volumes of bitcoin. Some other countries in the region are watching El Salvador's bitcoin experiment and may follow suit in order to escape dependence on the dollar. However, Prasad also warned newer, more sophisticated cryptocurrencies that use versions of bitcoin's blockchain technology may eventually replace bitcoin entirely. Bitcoin’s use of the blockchain technology is not very efficient, said Prasad, who is the author of The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution is Transforming Currencies and Finance. Bitcoin uses a validation mechanism for transactions that is environmentally destructive and doesn’t scale up very well, said Prasad, who does believe blockchain technology will be fundamentally transformative for the financial services industry.Bitcoin critics have previously pointed to bitcoin's huge energy demands as one major reason other cryptocurrencies could eventually supplant it. Bitcoin is currently by far the most valuable cryptocurrecy of the thousands in existence. Bitcoin is worth around double ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency and far more than all the others. Ethereum itself, launched a few years after bitcoin, is currently battling against rivals that claim to have improved on its technology and attracted huge investment in the last couple of years. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has fallen sharply this past month, dragging down the ethereum price and the price <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

I was personally buying when we dipped back close to $30,000, a few months ago. A lot of people have some dry powder on the sidelines just waiting to come back in at rock bottom prices.Earlier this year, Powell made headlines when he predicted the bitcoin price could hit $100,000 before the end of 2021.It’s hard to know where [the bitcoin price] goes, Powell said, but couching that he's still bullish on bitcoin in the long term. When you look at a long-term trendline of bitcoin and it’s just up consistently. I always tell people, 'If you think about buying bitcoin, think about it as a five-year plus investment.'Earlier this month, other bitcoin and crypto market watchers began calling out some of the more ambitious bitcoin price predictions. $100,000 by the end of the year is a difficult prediction to make. I think $100,000 could be in target in 2022 but this year, I’m not so sure, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in <a aria-label=an interview class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-06/bitwise-cio-s-crypto-predictions-for-2022-video href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-06/bitwise-cio-s-crypto-predictions-for-2022-video rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-06/bitwise-cio-s-crypto-predictions-for-2022-video>an interview</a>. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has been on a downward trend for the last month, dropping more than 20% in just <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> the last 30 days and adding a broader crypto rout that's hit ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, cardano, and XRP. </span>Others are taking a watch-and-see approach to the bitcoin price as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world move to taper their Covid-19 pandemic stimulus measures. The downward trajectory pertaining to bitcoin currently remains intact as market participants continue to price in fundamentals, Tammy Da Costa, analyst at DailyFX, wrote in emailed comments. For much of this year, rising inflation has supported bitcoin prices allowing it to climb to yet another all-time high just last month. However, with global policymakers now expressing a more hawkish tone, bitcoin prices have stabilized above $45,000 which continues to provide support for the imminent move.This week, the Federal Reserve said it's expecting to raise interest rates three times in 2022 and will accelerate the winding down of its huge bond-buying policy in the face of soaring inflation that's hit a 40-year high. Much like gold and other safe-haven assets, investors have used bitcoin against rising inflation, added Da Costa. With higher interest rates and a faster pace of tapering now expected to proceed, further rate hikes may pose as an additional catalyst for price action over the longer term. From a technical aspect, the fact that prices have retraced by over 20% since the November high confirms that bitcoin has entered into a bear market. Although price action is currently trading within a well-defined range, bulls may struggle to regain control over the systemic, prominent trend, at least for now.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

(Photo by MARVIN RECINOS / AFP) (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images)</span>A consistent thread about bitcoin has been that if it succeeds, it will inevitably invite government legislation and regulation to shut it down. This has been a backhanded critique of sorts advanced by investors like <a aria-label=Ray Dalio class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-good-probability-government-outlaws-bitcoin.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-good-probability-government-outlaws-bitcoin.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-good-probability-government-outlaws-bitcoin.html>Ray Dalio</a> who are “on bitcoin’s side”, but worry about its success attracting the attention of the state powers that be.This isn’t an altogether surprising or irrational fear. We live centuries after the establishment of the nation-state as all-powerful welfare state, military, and taxation hub. It’s clear that state powers are often only reined in by “political” constraints (rather than physical or technical ones). Could governments shut down bitcoin if they wanted to?This is probably a lot harder than one might think. Bitcoin is somewhat resilient to government crackdowns because of its origin, and the way the network is built. While states, if focused enough, could probably inflict some damage to bitcoin if it was a central state objective across the board, there are many factors for why a “government crackdown” on bitcoin is overrated for destroying the network. Since bitcoin is internationalized, it would require consent and coordination among almost every nation-state in order to effectively crack down on bitcoin. While the major world powers (such as the United States and China) have a bloc-like effect, and whereas there has been more coordination (often US-led) on issues such as climate change and corporate tax rates, when you look at issues as diverse as COVID-19 and the tit-for-tats of “strategic rivals” and Olympic boycotts — it is still difficult to see countries focusing on bitcoin in unison.Large-scale coordination would be required to shut down the network in any meaningful way: otherwise, people could transact and support the bitcoin network in other nations or even in space. A slow nation-by-nation ban can affect the network: at an extreme, an unlikely state-led ban in the United States might choke off bitcoin from American-led financial systems and markets with near-total global reach. Yet, so long as bitcoin was trans-actable across other states, a “global ban” could not be accomplished nor a “government crackdown”.One of the most unique points about bitcoin is that there is no central leader figure to pin down. Satoshi’s disappearance, and Hal Finney’s untimely death, have led to a situation where there isn’t a “company CEO” or some other central leader to go after. While there are pressure points nation-states can use to pursue their objectives (for example, physical concentration of miners, key technical contributors still constrained by borders), there isn’t a central one, but rather a set of diffused ones. We saw this when the Chinese state banned bitcoin mining in its territory: did that spell the end of bitcoin? No: miners simply shifted their equipment elsewhere, and within a few months, <a aria-label=hash rate was as high if not higher than what it was before class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/bitcoin-network-hashrate-hits-all-time-high-after-china-crypto-ban.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/bitcoin-network-hashrate-hits-all-time-high-after-china-crypto-ban.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/bitcoin-network-hashrate-hits-all-time-high-after-china-crypto-ban.html>hash rate was as high if not higher than what it was before</a>. States are not used to dealing with organizations like this: they are used to dealing with multinational corporations to a certain extent, but there are usually a set of central pressure points and leadership that a state can lean on to get that corporation to adhere to certain rules and regulations. That, due to bitcoin’s unique creation story, is very unlikely to happen with any attacks on the bitcoin network. In the United States, code is regarded as “protected” speech — software source code which powers bitcoin is <a aria-label=protected by the First Amendment class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/is-code-free-speech/ href=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/is-code-free-speech/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/is-code-free-speech/>protected by the First Amendment</a>. In order to attack the distribution of code that powers bitcoin, countries like the United States would have to fundamentally change themselves and subvert long-held covenants of limited powers and the rule of law. This is not impossible (bitcoin, over a decades and even centuries long time horizon is a bet that (some) technical constraints are better than purely political ones for maintaining rule of law) but would be very out of character, and probably politically untenable. The Internet may never have been encrypted at all — export controls were initially placed on encryption, and commercial uses were seen skeptically. However, states partially relented when the commercial possibility of the Internet became clear. Now encryption powers communications as well as online banking and e-commerce sales. This is not something states like: the Five Eyes and allied countries want to subvert end-to-end encryption and authoritarian states like the Chinese state either have backdoors or other mechanisms to promote social control. Yet it shows that, when faced with something that might threaten national security, the need for states to show GDP outcomes and to deliver wealth to their peoples might override their preferences in other areas. As more and more countries adapt bitcoin in some fashion, this pressure will become larger until perhaps one day, we might see a bitcoin-friendly bloc of nations emerge similar to the <a aria-label=Cairns Group for agriculture class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cairnsgroup.org/Pages/Introduction.aspx href=https://www.cairnsgroup.org/Pages/Introduction.aspx rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cairnsgroup.org/Pages/Introduction.aspx>Cairns Group for agriculture</a>. Some will find that their domestic power-generation is more efficiently parsed through open-source bitcoin rather than supporting the fractional reserves of other countries. The more states are turned over to supporting the bitcoin network, the harder it will be for other states to attack it. The way bitcoin is implemented makes it (more) prohibitive for any centralized collection of computers to disrupt the system. With more than 170,000 PH/s of hash rate securing the system (as of the date of writing) from a coordinated 51% attack (where an attacker could take over the system and propogate invalid spends in order to down the system for legitimate users, or to benefit monetarily from it), a projected security budget of around $45-60mn a day, and <a aria-label=enough stakeholders class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://gist.github.com/fernandonm/ef9721bacf7284e039caf39ba2a07258 href=https://gist.github.com/fernandonm/ef9721bacf7284e039caf39ba2a07258 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://gist.github.com/fernandonm/ef9721bacf7284e039caf39ba2a07258>enough stakeholders</a> (from investors, code contributors, analytics firms, miners and businesses — and now governments — that accept bitcoin) who have placed their financial livelihoods on monitoring the chain such that bitcoin could be secure beyond its fundamental dynamics — bitcoin is large enough to warrant significant resources for any attack, resources that wouldn’t be available for just any nation-state, and which would have to be continually deployed in a way that would make it hard to obscure who the attacker was. —-We live in a heady time where “magic Internet money” has suddenly become the concern of Clausewitz readers around the world. As bitcoin grows more prominent, the possibility that it attracts state powers to disrupt or fully coopt it grows — yet those who play some part in the network, either from investing, transacting or supporting its infrastructure, can rest assured that the system has some inherent properties that make it more resilient than you might expect to even the strongest of attacks.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I was one of the first writers in 2014 to write about the intersection of cryptocurrencies in remittance payments and drug policy with VentureBeat and TechCrunch.

And even if they don’t have a wallet or have any crypto experience, the funds will get transferred to this intermediary wallet on-chain that only they will have access to, or you the sender will have access to.”</span><span>For users, this is simple.</span>Coincast aims to make crypto simpleBut on the backend, Coincast does a lot of complicated math to enable this “intermediary wallet” because it does not take custody of the cryptocurrency in transit. Rather, Coincast actually deletes a part of the private key that secures cryptocurrency in non-custodial wallets and then literally brute-forces that part when someone receives the funds. (If you’re not a crypto person, non-custodial wallets are cryptocurrency wallets that you — and only you — control, or have custody over. They are secured by long and complicated “private keys:” essentially a password. Lose that password, and you literally could lose access to the cryptocurrency forever.)“The nice thing is that the user is completely ignorant to all this ... they’re just getting a withdrawal PIN and entering the PIN, and then it says ‘loading’ and then they have their money,” says Renshaw. “They don’t actually know that it’s part of a brute forcing process or anything like that.”Making crypto easy is important if the next billion people are going to start using digital cash, minting NFTs, and participating in web3 projects.Right now, it’s simply too hard and too high risk for most: crypto can get lost in transit, it can become inaccessible on your very own smartphone, or even lost in cold storage or a hardware wallet.While the regular world of finance has its own issues and complexities, these new challenges, along with all the forest of apps and terms and platforms in the emerging world of cryptocurrency, keeps potential users and adopters at bey.“Right now ... if you’re using something like Coinbase Wallet, typically you’re going to be using Bitcoin addresses or Ethereum addresses, they’re long strings of hexadecimal characters and things like that,” says Renshaw. “You might use QR codes, that’s an easy thing. But in our opinion, everyone has a phone number and so it just gets really easy to just send crypto via phone number.”Part of the impetus: Renshaw telling relatives about Bitcoin years ago.Despite the fact that it was cheap and available, most didn’t take his advice and buy any, simply because buying and storing crypto was hard. It’s gotten easier over the years, but it remains challenging for many.Using a custodial wallet, like the Coinbase website, is easier. (Note: Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase are different things.) Coinbase has custody of cryptocurrency that you store and manage on the company’s website, and that has some advantages for accessing, trading, and cashing out.But it does mean you’re not fully in charge of your own currency.And it also means that customers have to go through Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protections, which means extra hassle and challenge in getting starting. (I tried to give my kids a little bit of crypto. They gave up before I could send them any.)Crypto is already so hard — and irreversible — that even cryptocurrency companies regularly send funds mistakenly. Decentralized finance platform Compound <a aria-label=recently sent $90 million class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/defi-protocol-compound-mistakenly-gives-away-millions-to-users.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/defi-protocol-compound-mistakenly-gives-away-millions-to-users.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/defi-protocol-compound-mistakenly-gives-away-millions-to-users.html>recently sent $90 million</a> of its own tokens to the wrong people, prompting the CEO to beg for people to voluntarily return the funds.Anything that makes it easier, therefore, is probably a good thing.Including recovering from a disaster scenario: lost crypto. Despite the fact that Coincast is a non-custodial wallet, there is an option users can enable that will allow Coincast to recover lost funds.“We actually secure users’ wallets with a process we’ve created called Presign Protection, and this is something that’s patent pending as well for us,” Renshaw says. “If the user’s opted into this, they don’t have to, but if they have, we actually sign a transaction that essentially drains your wallet into our corporate cold storage. We don’t broadcast the transaction. We just sign it ahead of time so that it’s a valid transaction. We then encrypt it with high 256-bit encryption and store that on our servers. So theoretically, later on a year from now if you realize, ‘I forgot my PIN, I don’t have access to my wallet,’ we can then go through the courts or some process like that and verify ownership.”Hard-core crypto aficionados will never do that.But grandma might, and while it requires trust that Coincast won’t do nefarious things with your funds, it also provides peace of mind that the Ethereum that you forgot about in 2021 and is worth $250,000 in 2030 ... is actually recoverable.Renshaw doesn’t plan to stop with texting crypto. Next up is interfacing with DApps (decentralized apps) and web3 projects, plus NFTs.<em>Subscribe to </em><a aria-label=TechFirst class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://anchor.fm/techfirst/episodes/Can-Coincast-make-crypto-as-easy-as-texting-e1b3ldr/a-a70sb9i href=https://anchor.fm/techfirst/episodes/Can-Coincast-make-crypto-as-easy-as-texting-e1b3ldr/a-a70sb9i rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://anchor.fm/techfirst/episodes/Can-Coincast-make-crypto-as-easy-as-texting-e1b3ldr/a-a70sb9i><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://anchor.fm/techfirst/episodes/Can-Coincast-make-crypto-as-easy-as-texting-e1b3ldr/a-a70sb9i>TechFirst</em></a><em>, or get a </em><a aria-label=full transcript class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://johnkoetsier.com/crypto-easy/ href=https://johnkoetsier.com/crypto-easy/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://johnkoetsier.com/crypto-easy/><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://johnkoetsier.com/crypto-easy/>full transcript</em></a><em>.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I forecast and analyze trends affecting the mobile ecosystem.

Helping you understand the world of bitcoin and crypto, every weekday</strong>Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has adopted dogecoin as something of a pet project this year even after <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> he added billions of dollars worth of bitcoin to Tesla's balance sheet. </span>Bitcoin is an interesting example and the prime mover on this, Musk said in <a aria-label=a video class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1470378129575325700?s=20 href=https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1470378129575325700?s=20 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1470378129575325700?s=20>a video</a> shared to Twitter by<em> Time</em>. The transaction volume of bitcoin is low and cost per transaction is high. Bitcoin is maybe suitable as a store of value but fundamentally bitcoin isn't a good substitute for transactional currency. Even though it was created as a silly joke, dogecoin is better suited for transactions, Musk said, explaining, the total transaction flow that you can do with dogecoin, transactions per day, is substantially higher [than bitcoin] and it has much higher potential.Musk, who also told the magazine he doesn’t think dogecoin, bitcoin, ethereum or any other cryptocurrency will fully replace fiat currency, has now said <a aria-label=via Twitter class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470703708677840896 href=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470703708677840896 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470703708677840896>via Twitter</a> that Tesla will make some merch buyable with doge and see how it goes, following in the footsteps of fellow dogecoin supporter and technology investor Mark Cuban who added dogecoin support for NBA team Dallas Mavericks merchandise in March. The bitcoin price has soared over the last 12 months as traders and investors bet it will act as a hedge against the inflation created by huge government Covid-19 stimulus measures. In May 2020, famed macro investor Paul Tudor Jones made headlines when he revealed he thought bitcoin was the fastest horse to beat inflation.However, Musk has said he thinks dogecoin's inflationary nature could help it dominate the crypto payments space. Dogecoin is slightly inflationary but that inflationary number is a fixed number as opposed to a percentage, Musk told <em>Time</em> this week. So that means over time its percentage of inflation actually decreases. That's actually good because it encourages people to spend rather than hoard it as a store of value.Musk also said his experience in the payments industry means he understands how the money system works better than most.I could really wax on about the nature of money for hours because I played a significant role in creating PayPal, he said. My understanding of the money system at a fundamental level of how it actually works, the detailed mechanics of it, there are very few people that understand it better than me.The massive bitcoin price rally, taking bitcoin from under $20,000 per bitcoin this time last year to highs of almost $70,000 last month, has helped the broader crypto market surge to a combined value of around $3 trillion.However, Musk denied his tweets are a factor in bitcoin and crypto price swings even after his tweets have repeatedly boosted the dogecoin price over recent years and his post that Tesla would stop accepting bitcoin payments because of concerns over its environmental impact tanked the bitcoin price by 15%.Markets move themselves all the time based on nothing as far as I can tell, Musk said. So the statements that I make, are they materially different from random movements of the stock that might happen anyway? I don’t think so.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The dogecoin price has lost almost 80% of its value since it peaked in May this year but remains up <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> an eye-watering 5,000% since December 2020—leaving bitcoin, ethereum and most other cryptocurrencies in the dust. </span>Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has rocketed 500% over the last 12 months, far outpacing bitcoin's rally amid a surge of interest in ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Many ethereum rivals have also soared as investors bet they could win market share from ethereum. Dogecoin, helped on by support from the likes of Musk and other high-profile investors and influencers, has climbed a blistering 5,000% over the last year—even though the dogecoin price is now down almost 80% from its all-time high set in May ahead of Musk's much-hyped appearance on comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live. Since then Musk has called on dogecoin developers to upgrade the meme-based cryptocurrency with faster transaction times and lower fees in order to beat bitcoin hands down.The wider bitcoin and crypto market also remains highly volatile and has fallen sharply in recent weeks, wiping almost $1 trillion worth of value from the combined market.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

If you look at the ethereum price, ethereum still trades bullish [compared to bitcoin].The bitcoin price has been left in the dust by ethereum's huge price rally over the last year. The ethereum price is up around 650% since December last year, compared to bitcoin's near 200% rally. Meanwhile, many ethereum rivals have soared far higher as investors bet they could win users from ethereum's blockchain.The non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) crazes, both largely built on ethereum's blockchain, are thought to be the main driver of ethereum's surge higher this last year. Meanwhile, Novogratz expects both crypto and equity markets to have a monster fourth quarter as it feels like this is the last surge of 'we've got to get our money out to work.'However, crypto's not trading as bullish as equities because you see this tension, that the Fed's going to take the booze away from the punchbowl much sooner than we thought, Novogratz said.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices failed to rally sharply after the latest inflation data came out. Bitcoin prices experienced some modest gains earlier today, pushing higher after a key measure of inflation reached its highest in <a aria-label=almost 40 years class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm href=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm>almost 40 years</a>.

The digital currency went from roughly $48,900 shortly before the report was released at 8:30 a.m. EST to $50,038.20 within 10 minutes, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. Following this upward movement, the cryptocurrency fell back, dropping to less than $48,000 around 10 a.m. EST, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. At the time of this writing, the digital asset has suffered further losses, dropping to as little as $47,300.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]<strong>Inflation Hedge?</strong>Market analysts have repeatedly claimed that bitcoin is an inflation hedge, emphasizing the digital scarcity that is built into the cryptocurrency’s code. Under existing rules, no more than roughly 21 million units of bitcoin can ever be created. This provides a stark contrast to fiat currency, which central banks could theoretically print in limitless amounts. Over the last few years, these central banks have printed trillions of dollars’ worth of currency in an effort to provide stimulus and shore up shaky economic conditions. A measure of the U.S. money supply, called M2, <a aria-label=climbed more than 35% class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/articles/monetary-bathtub-overflowing-inflation-drain-transitory-11634847429 href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/monetary-bathtub-overflowing-inflation-drain-transitory-11634847429 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.wsj.com/articles/monetary-bathtub-overflowing-inflation-drain-transitory-11634847429>climbed more than 35%</a> between December 2019 and August 2021. It is impossible to know how much fiat currency central banks will print in the coming years, but the more they produce, the less purchasing power it will have, all other things being equal. Under such circumstances, it is easy to see why many crypto enthusiasts might flock to bitcoin, which has a hard cap on total supply, in order to preserve their wealth.However, market observers must keep in mind that bitcoin, and the broader crypto market, have been around for a rather short period of time in the grand scheme of things. The first units of bitcoin, the world’s most valuable digital currency by market value, first came into existence in January 2009. As a result, the digital asset has been available for purchase and sale for less than 13 years at the time of this writing. The stock market, in contrast, has been around for <a aria-label=hundreds of years class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/stock-exchange-history.asp href=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/stock-exchange-history.asp rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/stock-exchange-history.asp>hundreds of years</a>, and the bond market has also built up some <a aria-label=significant tenure class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/centuryofbonds.asp href=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/centuryofbonds.asp rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/centuryofbonds.asp>significant tenure</a>. Because of these considerations, market observers are working with rather limited price history when they seek to use market data to either support or refute the claim that bitcoin is an inflation hedge. As time goes on, investors will have more data they can use, but for now, the jury is out. <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

And the success of that business turned Bankman-Fried into the richest person in crypto at the age of 29 with a $26.5 billion fortune. And then he left.In September, Bankman-Fried jetted off to the Bahamas for good. His legions of social media followers were surprised by the unfamiliar sight of him donning a suit as FTX’s management team welcomed the country’s prime minister to their new headquarters. Why the Bahamas?“It’s really important that we have long-term regulatory guidance and clarity,” he said from the company’s office in the Caribbean archipelago. “Hong Kong has not yet drafted the actual bill...there’s uncertainty about exactly how that is going to turn out.”Hong Kong has developed into a hotbed for blockchain and crypto-related businesses. Many of the global elites from the crypto industry got their start in Hong Kong, including exchanges Crypto.com, BitMEX, Bitfinex, OSL and others. The world’s largest stablecoin, Tether, was launched from Hong Kong. And the city notched up an astounding $60 billion worth of incoming cryptocurrencies between July 2020 and June 2021, according to blockchain data firm Chainalysis.<a aria-label=Register now for our most popular crypto webinar of the year class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg href=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg>Register now for our most popular crypto webinar of the year </em></a><a aria-label=“Crypto Outlook 2022: What You Need To Know” class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg href=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg>“Crypto Outlook 2022: What You Need To Know</em>”</strong></a>But regulatory uncertainty in Hong Kong combined with strict quarantine requirements have become catalysts for some crypto companies to shift their operations to other markets where regulators are moving more swiftly to roll out rules that support the nascent industry. Singapore is the nearest such location<strong> </strong>and it managed to attract a veritable who’s who of the crypto billionaire ranks.

Although the financial regulator has turned down two applicants so far, three other candidates, Australia-based exchange Independent Reserve, the brokerage arm of DBS Bank and Singapore’s fintech company Fomo Pay, announced over the past three months that they had secured licenses. Coinhako also said in November that it had received in-principle approval from MAS, making it the latest to begin operating as a regulated crypto exchange in the country. So far, around 70 crypto-related service providers have been granted temporary exemptions that allow them to operate without a license for six months. <small>Forbes Asia</small>Crypto.com, the world’s third-largest spot exchange by 24-hour trading volume, according to CoinGecko, shifted its headquarters this year from Hong Kong to Singapore. <a aria-label=Eqonex Group class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://group.eqonex.com/ href=https://group.eqonex.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://group.eqonex.com/>Eqonex Group</a>, a Nasdaq-listed digital asset financial services firm, established its crypto derivatives exchange last year in Singapore rather than Hong Kong, where it operates much of its other businesses. The firm, formerly known as Diginex, cited Hong Kong’s regulatory regime which bans crypto derivatives and limits trading services to professional investors.“These were the two things that we really didn’t feel were the right way to go, and in fact were contrary to the way that we had designed our products,” said Richard Byworth, CEO of Eqonex Group. Hong Kong introduced an opt-in licensing regime in 2019 for platforms that allow investors to buy and sell security tokens, which are traditional stocks and bonds in a digital form. At the time, most cryptocurrencies fell outside the scope of the framework. Furthermore, licensed exchanges are only allowed to serve professional investors with a portfolio of at least HK$8 million ($1 million) in liquid assets. They are also banned from offering traders access to crypto futures and derivatives.So far, the only firm to be granted a license under Hong Kong’s voluntary regime is crypto trading platform <a aria-label=OSL class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://osl.com/en/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlOmLBhCHARIsAGiJg7mj58rlCpGjAZPbMhcwiZAem8vgTXpGegkRICXhUjm8VA4GGuoqUnsaAmp_EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds href=https://osl.com/en/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlOmLBhCHARIsAGiJg7mj58rlCpGjAZPbMhcwiZAem8vgTXpGegkRICXhUjm8VA4GGuoqUnsaAmp_EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://osl.com/en/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlOmLBhCHARIsAGiJg7mj58rlCpGjAZPbMhcwiZAem8vgTXpGegkRICXhUjm8VA4GGuoqUnsaAmp_EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds>OSL</a>. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in November that it has applications from several other firms under consideration. Wayne Trench, CEO of Hong Kong-based digital asset trading platform OSL.Now, the city’s regulators are discussing the possibility of a compulsory licensing regime for exchanges that offer virtual asset trading, including bitcoin and others that were previously excluded. The proposal, however, still suggests limiting exchanges operating in Hong Kong to only offering services to high-net-worth individuals. The restrictions on crypto derivatives are also likely to apply on licensees under the new regime. “Frankly, it’s not an easy set of rules to comply with. But what the Hong Kong regulations have done is deliver, in my mind, the highest level of investor protection in digital assets anywhere in the world,” said Wayne Trench, CEO of OSL. But others contend the policy will result in retail investors taking even greater risks if their only option is to resort to using unregulated exchanges to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. “As much as you want to ban it, people will always find a way to buy crypto, and they will do it somewhere else,” said Henri Arslanian, crypto leader of PwC based in Hong Kong. “It’s just the reality of it, which puts the public more at risk ironically.”Nearly one-third of Hong Kong’s residents are estimated to have invested in, transferred, or exchanged cryptocurrencies for goods and services, according to a <a aria-label=newly published survey class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/regional/na/us/Solutions/documents/visa-crypto-consumer-perceptions-white-paper.pdf href=https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/regional/na/us/Solutions/documents/visa-crypto-consumer-perceptions-white-paper.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/regional/na/us/Solutions/documents/visa-crypto-consumer-perceptions-white-paper.pdf>newly published survey</a> by payments giant Visa. Among developed markets, Hong Kong was ranked only behind the U.S. in terms of its residents engagement with the digital assets, the survey shows.The SFC said last month that they are currently reviewing the rules that block retail investors from using crypto trading platforms as part of its efforts in maintaining a practical approach toward providing a “well-defined” regulatory environment.Byworth of Eqonex said Hong Kong still has other policies in its favor that make it easier for the city’s businesses to recruit and retain international talent. “Even if Hong Kong goes down on a road of restrictive regulations around crypto and loses a lot of people to Singapore, the city can take quite a lot of market share back at any moment when it decides to change course and reverse into a more flexible regulatory regime,” he said.Visitors to Hong Kong Fintech Week walk past a booth displaying the symbols for bitcoin and ether on November 4, 2021. It’s not just the regulatory framework that matters, but also the pandemic travel restrictions that have an impact on Hong Kong’s appeal as a place to do business. The city’s “zero infection” strategy has become a major obstacle for many of the businesses based there. Residents returning to Hong Kong face a mandatory hotel quarantine period of up to three weeks.The<a aria-label=Asia Securities Industry &amp; Financial Markets Association class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.asifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/asifma-letter-call-for-clarity-and-engagement-regarding-hong-kongs-covid-19-response.pdf href=https://www.asifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/asifma-letter-call-for-clarity-and-engagement-regarding-hong-kongs-covid-19-response.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.asifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/asifma-letter-call-for-clarity-and-engagement-regarding-hong-kongs-covid-19-response.pdf> Asia Securities Industry &amp; Financial Markets Association</a>, a lobby group representing some of the world’s biggest banks, said Hong Kong’s status as a financial center was at risk because of its “highly restrictive” quarantine policy. The group said in October that 48% of the companies<strong> </strong>polled in a recent survey were contemplating moving staff or functions away from Hong Kong due to the uncertainty over when the restrictions would be lifted. Meanwhile, Singapore has already opened its border to vaccinated travelers from at least 18 countries. Aside from starting to ease travel restrictions, the city-state’s proactive stance on regulation makes it more attractive as other jurisdictions move in the opposite direction. Singapore is gaining headway as some nearby countries, such as China and South Korea, clamp down on their domestic crypto industries. China recently banned all cryptocurrency transactions and mining, and South Korea shut down nearly 40 exchanges deemed unqualified in September.Coinbase’s debut in Japan in August shed a positive light on the country, which has been at the forefront of regulating crypto assets since 2017 following the $460 million bitcoin hack on local exchange Mt. Gox. But crypto-related crimes are still a problem for Japan, where trading platform Liquid also became the victim of a cyberattack just months ago. To be sure, Singapore can’t rest on its laurels just yet. The government still has to decide whether the trading of crypto derivatives will be permitted. The digital instruments range from those that already exist in traditional market like futures and options, to the more innovative ones like “perpetual swaps,” a type of futures contract without an expiry date.<small>Forbes Asia</small>The Monetary Authority of Singapore said last year that it will not regulate crypto derivatives unless they are offered on approved trading platforms, and the authority warned retail investors of their risks.The reality is that only a handful of countries have even begun to discuss crypto derivatives. “There’s no one-size-fits-all perfect crypto regulatory regime out there,” said Arslanian of PwC. “All that the crypto ecosystem wants is clarity and the ability to operate a business.”The Bahamas is a standout in this regard because it moved quickly in late 2020 to lay out a comprehensive framework across both spot and derivatives trading which gave it a first-mover advantage.According to Bankman-Fried, the restrictions on services to a local market are less important than restrictions that hinder or even block a business from offering its services to the rest of the world. “Because for most companies, this isn’t just about maximizing how much business can be done directly toward one place’s population, it’s more about where is a good home for a business generally,” he said.Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto derivatives exchange FTX.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am the reporter and multimedia producer for Forbes Asia, based in Hong Kong.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> investors pile into cryptocurrencies. </span>We expect the U.S. to embrace cryptocurrencies in 2022, with proper regulation and related bullish price implications, Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone wrote in his latest research note, adding, the unlimited supply of fiat currency should sustain rising prices, notably in bitcoin and ethereum, which have limited supply.The price of bitcoin, ethereum and most other major cryptocurrencies have risen sharply over the last year, in part due to the huge monetary stimulus measures undertaken by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world that have boosted the price of stock markets and assets across the board. However, soaring inflation and a strong U.S. jobs market could mean the Fed moves to curtail its stimulus program in 2022—something McGlone thinks could mean the price of both bitcoin and ethereum continue to rise even as stock markets fall. Renewed impetus from the Federal Reserve to take away the punch bowl, and declining bond yields may point to a macroeconomic environment in 2022 that favors top cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum, wrote McGlone. Crypto assets showing divergent strength versus equities near the end of 2021 may portend continued digital-asset outperformance in 2022.Stock markets have seesawed through December due to fears over a new Covid-19 variant and the Fed potentially accelerating its planned stimulus tapering in the face of surging inflation. A primary force to reverse expectations for Federal Reserve tightening in 2022 is a drop in the stock market, which may be a bit of a win-win for bitcoin, wrote McGlone, adding, bitcoin appears to be on a trajectory for $100,000, and is well on its way to becoming a digital store-of-value, similar to gold.We see it as more of a question of time, notably due to the eonomic basics of increasing demand versus decreasing supply, wrote McGlone.Some 90% of all the 21 million bitcoins have now been created—or mined—and the likes of MicroStrategy

The key question is how overextended prices may need to get for a pullback, and how deep into support the number two crypto may dip until it finds responsive buyers, adding $4,000 may act as the key pivot for 2022.Mcglone's bitcoin and ethereum price prediction came ahead of some of the biggest cryptocurrency industry executives appearing before U.S. lawmakers, warning that if regulations are not updated to permit the sector to flourish, companies would relocate overseas.Without tailored legislative solutions that are openly debated with public participation, the United States risks unnecessarily onerous and chilling laws and regulations, said Coinbase chief financial officer Alesia Haas.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

The world’s most prominent digital currency was valued close to $49,800 early this morning, before briefly climbing above $50,350 hours later, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. However, it subsequently dropped below $50,000, and it has been trading south of that price since then, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. This afternoon, the cryptocurrency fell to as little as $47,537.66, its lowest since Monday. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Several analysts offered their perspective on what these latest price movements mean. Marc Bernegger, a board member of <a aria-label=Crypto Finance Group class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cryptofinance.ch/ href=https://www.cryptofinance.ch/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cryptofinance.ch/>Crypto Finance Group</a>, spoke to the difficulty that bitcoin has had staying above $50,000 lately. “$50,000 is definitely an important psychological price level for bitcoin but as we see right now there is no strong support from market participants at this level.” Armando Aguilar, vice president of Digital Assets Strategy for <a aria-label=Fundstrat Global Advisors class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://fundstrat.com/ href=https://fundstrat.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://fundstrat.com/>Fundstrat Global Advisors</a>, also weighed in. Bitcoin “has been struggling to stay above $50k recently,” he emphasized, a development that could potentially “create additional market overreaction and bring additional selloffs.”In addition to speaking to this possibility of further declines, Aguilar also provided some bullish technical analysis. “The hourly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) seems to be losing steam in the bearish zone, pointing to a potential price upward momentum,” he said.“Buy signals occur when the MACD moves above zero, and potential sell signals when it crosses below zero.” Should bitcoin prices push higher, Aguilar outlined several resistance levels it could encounter. “The next upside resistance level is near $50,500 area, followed by $52,000 and $53,750.” Galina Likhitskaya, VP of Operation &amp; Product for blockchain firm <a aria-label=HashEx class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashex.org/ href=https://hashex.org/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://hashex.org/>HashEx</a>, commented on the situation, pointing out some key market factors that investors should know. “The price of Bitcoin has traded in the negative for the better part of Thursday, a move that is in sharp contrast to the positive fundamentals the Bitcoin market is currently recording,” she said.“Taking a look beyond the price, we would discover that the institutional investors that consider Bitcoin as their safe-haven assets are still buying, as in the case of MicroStrategy who just scooped additional 1,434 units of the cryptocurrency.” Likhitskaya was referring to the latest bitcoin purchase made by software firm MicroStrategy, which currently owns more than 120,000 units of the cryptocurrency, according to <a aria-label=CoinDesk class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/microstrategy-says-it-bought-1434-bitcoins-since-nov-29/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/microstrategy-says-it-bought-1434-bitcoins-since-nov-29/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/microstrategy-says-it-bought-1434-bitcoins-since-nov-29/>CoinDesk</a>.“Additionally, we can attribute the recent selloffs to the new buyers taking profits as the majority (about 97%) of the BTC in current circulation remains unsold per data from Glassnode,” she noted. “This is an indication that the ongoing price crash is superficial and does not in any way showcase weakness on the part of the premier cryptocurrency.”Dylan LeClair, head of market research for <a aria-label=Bitcoin Magazine class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/>Bitcoin Magazine</a>, offered a similar take. “Bitcoin looks to be in a consolidation period for the time being, with excessive leverage having been wiped out of the market last weekend and many funds looking to be conservative with their positioning heading into year’s end,” he stated. “The current price of $48,000 is much more of an organic price driven by spot demand than when price was in the high 50s or 60s,” said LeClair.“Bullish catalysts over the short term look minimal, but over the medium/long term the reality remains the same – i.e., central banks are conducting the biggest monetary experiment the world has ever seen, and Bitcoin is an alternate safe haven to protect your wealth against it.”<em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Cheap Money No. 2A picture is worth a thousand words. And the cash in your wallet is worth less than you think.That’s the message that hedge fund manager turned guerrilla artist Nelson Saiers is trying to get across with his latest installation at Wall Street’s Charging Bull sculpture.Saiers is best known for the giant inflatable rat that he emblazoned with bitcoin’s programming code and erected outside the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington DC three years ago.“Warren Buffett called bitcoin ‘rat poison squared’,” <a aria-label=the artist told CoinDesk at the time class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/09/theres-a-giant-bitcoin-rat-on-wall-street-and-its-staring-down-the-fed/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/09/theres-a-giant-bitcoin-rat-on-wall-street-and-its-staring-down-the-fed/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/09/theres-a-giant-bitcoin-rat-on-wall-street-and-its-staring-down-the-fed/>the artist told CoinDesk at the time</a>. “But if the Fed’s a rat, then maybe rat poison is a good thing?”Now the so-called Warhol of Wall Street is turning his attention back to New York’s financial district. ‘Cheap Money No. 2’ consists of a vintage gumball machine with an “Out of Order!” sign crudely taped to the front. The gumball containers are filled with $2 notes that are on sale for $0.25 – a not-so-subtle swipe at the Fed’s penchant for cheap money, or ultra-loose monetary policies that <a aria-label=keep the economy on life support by eroding the value of everyone’s savings class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/11/20/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-weapon-society-has-against-inflation-and-wealth-inequality/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/11/20/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-weapon-society-has-against-inflation-and-wealth-inequality/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/11/20/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-weapon-society-has-against-inflation-and-wealth-inequality/>keep the economy on life support by eroding the value of everyone’s savings</a>.If, like me, you’re skeptical of modern art then you might, initially, feel underwhelmed by the work’s simplicity.But any deflation must be set against the abject failure of the mainstream media to educate consumers about the toxic effect of cheap money on their financial health. Official inflation rates have now reached 6.2% in America, 4.2% in the UK and 4.1% in the EU. Unofficial rates that include investments like property are much higher. The underlying causes may be open to debate, <a aria-label=but it’s a pretty safe bet that the Fed’s obsession with money printing hasn’t helped matters class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/economists-eye-surging-money-supply-inflation-fears-mount-2021-06-17/ href=https://www.reuters.com/business/economists-eye-surging-money-supply-inflation-fears-mount-2021-06-17/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.reuters.com/business/economists-eye-surging-money-supply-inflation-fears-mount-2021-06-17/>but it’s a pretty safe bet that the Fed’s obsession with money printing hasn’t helped matters</a>.Worryingly, there’s also strong evidence that the Fed is actively trying to suppress the general public’s understanding of the issue. Why else, for example, would it have reduced the frequency with which it publishes M1 and M2 money supply data this year, ending more than four decades of transparency?The respected economist Steve Hanke – no fan of bitcoin, but also no lapdog of the Fed – alluded to this in his interview with Kitco in April (<a aria-label=the full video class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-04-06/Is-the-Fed-hiding-something-Why-weekly-money-supply-data-just-got-discontinued-Steve-Hanke.html href=https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-04-06/Is-the-Fed-hiding-something-Why-weekly-money-supply-data-just-got-discontinued-Steve-Hanke.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-04-06/Is-the-Fed-hiding-something-Why-weekly-money-supply-data-just-got-discontinued-Steve-Hanke.html>the full video</a> is well worth watching if you have 20 minutes to spare).[Fed] chairman [Jerome] Powell has very explicitly claimed that money doesn't matter in recent testimony,” Hanke noted. “He's basically said that money and the measurement of money doesn't really matter because it's unrelated to inflation.“In principle, they don't think [this data] is important … Their preference would probably be to not report any monetary statistics.”Small wonder when you look at what Powell and co. have done to the money supply: <a aria-label=37% of all the US dollars circulating in the economy today have appeared out of thin air since February 2020 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL href=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL>37% of all the US dollars circulating in the economy today have appeared out of thin air since February 2020</a>, when the Fed cranked up its money printers in response to covid-19. Unless your bank balance has also ballooned by 37% since then, it’s <em>you</em> that’s getting the short end of that stick.Look again at Saiers’ installation, and its simplicity starts to feel like a virtue. Where journalists, politicians and central bankers have failed to acknowledge the problem, he’s illustrating it as unambiguously and intuitively as possible.There’s more going on with the piece, of course. ‘No. 2’ was preceded by ‘No. 1’, which had $10 notes – rather than $2 notes – stuffed into the gumball containers. The denominations are a nod to the early economic policy debates between America’s founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton – so says the artwork’s press release, anyway.For me personally, though, it’s the visual impact of the ‘Out of Order!’ sign combined with the logical ouroboros of the machine's pricing that resonates loudest. To appreciate this you need only contemplate what would actually happen if you purchased a gumball container.On first impressions, you'd be delighted to acquire a $2 bill for a quarter. Yet, for the transaction to occur, it’s inescapable that the market value of this $2 is actually the $0.25 being handed over. What, then, to do with the $2? Certainly not buy $2 worth of goods, because it's not worth that much any more. Perhaps you might exchange it for $16, then? Fine. And again. And again – as often as you like. But no matter what sum you end up with, the cash will only ever buy you $0.25 worth of goods; nothing has changed except your willful debasement of the currency you’re using. Are you listening, Chairman Powell?Saiers walked away from a highly lucrative career in finance in 2014 – having been managing director of Deutsche Bank AG and chief investment officer of Saiers Capital – in order to pursue his passion for mathematical art.“What you daydream about typically tells you what you’re most passionate about, or you love the most,” he says in the press release for ‘Cheap Money No. 2’.“I never didn’t want to run a hedge fund. It’s a great job. I was just more passionate about being an artist.”<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am an aviation journalist turned crypto reporter whose work has appeared in The Guardian, The Economist, The New York Times, Flightglobal, African Business, Al Arabiya &amp;amp; New Eastern Europe.

They are creating a marketplace for people to buy, sell and trade NFTs of established brands, sports teams, movie characters, cartoons and other much-loved, old-line media content. Think digital collectibles. Max, 24, and Zach, 28, recently partnered with ViacomCBS and raised a massive $50 million round led by hedge fund billionaire Stevie Cohen, which valued the marketplace at $333 billion.<br/><small>PARADIGM</small>Caruso is an investment partner at Paradigm, the crypto-focused firm founded in 2018. Caruso has helped make investments into companies such as Axie Infinity, AI Arena and several more that are unannounced. Previously, she was an engineer at Google, where she worked on a machine learning research team studying user behavior. In parallel, she worked at Bessemer Venture Partners part-time as an investor focused on frontier tech: crypto, machine learning and quantum computing.<br/><small>TRIBE CAPITAL</small>Madfes is a partner at Tribe Capital, a $1.5 billion venture firm where he leads crypto initiatives. He’s led investments in Akash Networks, Eternal Return, Lit Protocol, Mnemonic, Titan, Visor Finance and WeMeta, among others, while helping the firm develop a strategy that includes long-term hold positions in liquid coins and tokens, and direct involvement with DAOs and decentralized communities. Madfes previously invested in crypto projects on behalf of a European family office, building a $100 million-plus portfolio.<br/><small>BLOCKWORKS</small>Fueled by the thesis that crypto would become a legitimate asset class, Michael Ippolito and Jason Yanowitz launched Blockworks, a news site for investors in digital assets that they call the Bloomberg for crypto. Since launching in 2018, they've expanded to run one of the largest crypto podcast networks in the world, as well as global conferences and a daily newsletter. They've bootstrapped the entire business and are expecting $10 million in revenue this year.<br/><small>pplpleasr</small>Emily Yang has dedicated her life to NFTs for good. Earlier this year she sold a DeFi animation for $525,000, and with the sale created the Stand With Asians Community Fund to support the AAPI causes. She's since donated over $700,000 to the fund and founded PleasrDAO, an NFT collective for charitable causes like purchasing Edward Snowden's NFT for $5.5 million and donating the proceeds to the Freedom of the Press.<br/><small>The Giving Block</small>Alex Wilson and Pat Duffy started The Giving Block in 2018 to create the new industry of Crypto Philanthropy. Their company, The Giving Block, has built the most comprehensive crypto fundraising solution and has become the leading Crypto Philanthropy product. It's used by over 700 nonprofits that have collectively raised over $100 million in crypto donations.<br/><small>Alameda Research</small>In August 2021 billionaire Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried promoted the traders to co-CEOs so he could focus on his FTX cryptocurrency exchange. By charging basis points on $5 billion volume a day the quantitative trading firm makes about $3-4 million daily. Through investing that income into blockchain platforms like Uniswap and Compound that connect lenders and borrowers with little overhead, Alamada generates an additional 7% to 50% annualized depending on the asset. Both natives of Boston, Ellison wrote her MIT professor-dad an economics paper analyzing stuffed animals' prices when she was eight years old, before getting a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Stanford and a job at Jane Street, where she met Bankman-Fried. Trabucco is a former competitive Scrabble player who studied computer science at MIT, where he also met the Alameda co-founder.<br/><small>OpenSea</small>The software engineer worked at Palantir and two early-stage startups before cofounding OpenSea in early 2018. OpenSea is the largest marketplace for consumers to buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In July, a month when the company processed $330 million in NFT transactions, it raised $100 million in funding at a $1.5 billion valuation. Over the past three months, OpenSea has processed roughly $3 billion in monthly volume.<br/><small>Slingshot</small>Founded in September 2020 Slingshot provides a single user-friendly portal to access defi trading platforms like Uniswap and others. Instead of charging fees on the $2 billion volume, they're experimenting with Robinhood's model that charges market makers to route orders. Unlike Robinhood, the company that is now closing an investment valuing it at $100 million, lets users audit trades on a public blockchain. After graduating from the University of Minnesota with a degree in computer science he founded Toshint Capital, a crypto hedge managing $30 million, and helped build the Astro Wallet bought by Coinbase in December 2019.<br/><small>dYdX</small>In 2017, after stints as a coder at Coinbase and Uber, Juliano started dYdX, a crypto derivatives trading platform that caters to professional traders outside the U.S. It averages roughly $2 billion in daily trading volume (Coinbase does about $5 billion). The 19-person startup brought in $75 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2021. It expects to reach $125 million in revenue for the full year and $80 million in net profit.<br/><small>Edge &amp; Node</small>After raising $22.5 million to help The Graph build an open source tool that lets ethereum developers understand how their products are being used, she co-founded Edge &amp; Node to help monetize the project. Edge &amp; Node was originally funded with an 8% stake of the GRT token, which is now worth about $648 million. Kline has also led Edge &amp; Node’s investments into projects adjacent to The Graph, totaling $3.1 million in 2021. Born to a stay-at-home mom and a dad who works on the railroad she was recruited out of college by Bank of America. Frustrated by the clunkiness of traditional finance, she joined ethereum VPN Orchid, in 2018, and helped build it to its current value of $342 million. <br/><small>Iron Fish</small>Originally founded to create a privacy protecting cryptocurrency like zcash, Iron Fish expanded to include privacy protecting technology that can be digitally wrapped around any cryptocurrency. The platform now has 750 fully functioning nodes compared to bitcoin's 10,000, and is preparing for a public launch later this year. As a child in Volgograd, Russia, Nadolinski was constantly reminded of WWII levelling of her town while playing in a playground made of tanks. She blames the relative dearth of companies from Russia relative to the high level of academic culture, and technical output, on a lack of property rights and privacy.<br/><small>TRM Labs</small>TRM Labs provides forensic analysis for the IRS and dozens of others. By charging for licenses that let customers identify where an asset came from, who owns it and score the risk of that owner, the firm has grown 700% since last year and is on track to generate several million dollars revenue this year. Born in New Delhi, India, he graduated from the University of Michigan with degrees in business and computer science. In April 2018 he founded TRM Labs as a game to drive cryptocurrency adoption, pivoting during an industry-wide drop in prices to help analyze blockchain data.<br/><small>Audius</small>Audius lets musicians create their own business models, using cryptography to ensure a their cut of the proceeds doesn't change without their consent. While the platform is not yet monetized 100,000 musicians have uploaded songs to the platform and last month 6 million listeners logged in. Further growth is expected following video-sharing app TikTok's August announcement it would let Audius musicians share their music directly on the site. Growing up in LA Rumberg used to sneak into EDM clubs to listen to his favorite performers, and was tired of seeing closed platforms like SoundCloud booting the acts for failing to comply with the rapidly changing terms.<br/><small>21Shares</small>Snyder co-founded 21Shares in 2018 to build sophisticated crypto investing technology her mom could use. Now valued at $700 million, the firm charges about a 2% management fee for 15 ETPs in 4 countries. With over $2.5 billion AUM it is on track for $60 million revenue this year. In October she and 21Shares board member Cathie Wood jointly filed with the SEC for what would be the first Bitcoin ETF. A native New Yorker, she earned a bachelors in earth systems from Stanford, working on Emmy winning Mission Blue, about a woman oceanographer, before discovering bitcoin.<br/><small>Fidelity Digital Assets</small>Hired by Fidelity in January 2021 to build a one-stop shop for institutional crypto adoption, he now manages billions of dollars' worth of crypto assets for 10 liquidity partners including Arizex and 150 other institutional clients. Through Fidelity venture branch Avon he invested in institutional crypto-trading platform Talos and crypto forensics firm Soldus Labs. Born in New York he earned a double major from Indiana University in finance and technology management, going on to help Bank of America make 25 investments in crypto and more. In November 2017 he helped early enterprise blockchain startup Symbiont raise $45 million. <br/><small>TaxBit</small>In 2018 Justin and his brother Austin launched TaxBit, giving enterprises real-time insight into taxes on crypto and equities. With clients including the IRS, the profitable firm raised $230 million from Tiger Global and others at a $1.33 billion valuation, but has yet to spend any of the capital it raised. Born in Seattle, Washington, at the age of 22 he became one of the youngest attorneys ever to get a law degree from the University of Chicago. While working a federal clerkship he discovered crypto, and in 2016 turned down a $75,000 bonus to found TaxBit.<em>List Editors</em><em>Consumer Tech: Steven Bertoni, Nina Wolpow and Will Yakowicz </em><em>Venture Capital: Alex Konrad and Rebecca Szkutak </em><em>Media: Abigail Freeman, Kristin Stoller and Haniyah Philogene </em><em>Art &amp; Style: Alexandra Sternlicht and Josh Burrell </em><em>Social Impact: Alexandra Wilson and Igor Bosilkovski </em><em>Finance: Maria Abreu, Michael del Castillo and Jeff Kauflin </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I report on cryptocurrencies and other applications of blockchain technology.

Dec 8 2021 09:07am ,"Business Trends Graphs and charts 3d imageBy now everyone’s heard of Bitcoin. It introduced the world to blockchain or distributed ledger technology and as a crypto asset, it is the center of the universe.  But bitcoin is hardly alone. In fact, an entire galaxy of crypto assets has been created to support a wide range of use cases and applications focused on verticals such as identity management, data storage, gaming, banking, lending, social media and streaming. Because Bitcoin started the industry, virtually every other crypto asset is called an <strong>alt-coin</strong>. Alt-coins can be categorized in a few different ways.<strong><em>Protocol Tokens</em></strong>Protocol tokens, also referred to as Level-1 or base layer tokens, are native to a blockchain and are necessary for the operation of a given platform. Bitcoin for example, is a protocol token, not only because it is what users send and receive over the network, but because it is also how miners (payment processors) get compensated for supplying their computer power.<a aria-label=Register now for our most popular crypto webinar of the year class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg href=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg>Register now for our most popular crypto webinar of the year </em></a><a aria-label=“Crypto Outlook 2022: What You Need To Know” class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg href=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://forbes.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216385581800/WN_Kw1KseCtQ5CBrfIFmBBbbg>“Crypto Outlook 2022: What You Need To Know</em>”</strong></a>Another protocol token<strong>, Ethereum </strong>is by far the most prominent and popular alt-coin. It has the second-largest market capitalization of $513 billion, behind only bitcoin ($1.04 trillion). It was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, who was looking to build a blockchain platform that could run and execute any type of software program or application. Bitcoin is relatively rigid in its composition, which is by design, as more functionality offered by a blockchain can also create additional security vulnerabilities.Ethereum operates in a similar manner to bitcoin, where miners expend substantial amounts of computer power to add transactions to the network. That said, there are many other prominent blockchains with their own protocol tokens, with some of the largest being <strong>Solana,</strong> <strong>Algorand, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, EOS and Polkadot.</strong><strong><em>Application Tokens</em></strong>If the base layer of a blockchain is the operating system, then decentralized applications (dapps) are the programs that run on top of them. Many of these applications have their own tokens (known as <strong>dapp tokens</strong>) that are also freely traded on many exchanges. Dapp tokens first came to prominence in 2017 and 2018 during the initial coin offering (ICO) craze, when many founders raised millions—sometimes billions of dollars——through token sales to fund product development. It is worth noting that the vast majority of these ICO projects failed and the value of their assets went to zero, which was a reflection of the novelty, hyperbole and excitement of the space.Nonetheless, today there are still dozens of dapp tokens in existence with market capitalizations in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars that underpin applications with real utility and actual business operations that make money, headlined by <strong>decentralized finance (DeFi) </strong>tokens. Some of the most prominent include <strong>Compound, AAVE, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve, PancakeSwap and Maker.</strong> DeFi is an umbrella term used to capture traditional financial applications (such as banking or lending) that are replicated on a blockchain through dapps and <strong>smart contracts, </strong>which are automatically executable pieces of code that activate when certain conditions are met. Think of smart contracts as if/then statements built into blockchains. For instance, you could place an order on a decentralized exchange to buy bitcoin if the price hits a certain point. Today, there is more than $270 billion locked up into blockchain applications and DeFi tokens.Finally, it is important to highlight the latest development in crypto, <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs). </strong>A core component of money, or crypto, is for every asset to be valued the same by every investor. They must be fungible. NFTs are the exact opposite of this. While they operate on top of blockchains just like any protocol or dapp token, they have a set of unique properties or characteristics that make them unique. If bitcoin is the first iteration of scarce digital value, then NFTs are the natural successors.<a aria-label=Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset &amp; Blockchain Advisor and discover hot new NFT and crypto blockbusters poised for 1,000% gains' class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=billybambrough&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=billybambrough&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=billybambrough&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=billybambrough&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex>Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset &amp; Blockchain Advisor and discover hot new NFT and crypto blockbusters poised for 1,000% gains'</em></a><strong>Staking And Passive Income</strong>For many investors, exposure to spot market prices has been risky and/or lucrative enough for their first forays into crypto. However, as the industry matures we are starting to see ways that investors can earn passive income on their holdings. This strategy can help top up gains or hedge against price risk.The top two strategies are staking and yield farming. I’ll break each one down individually.<strong><em>Staking</em></strong>Staking is the act of posting certain crypto assets as collateral to participate in the operation of a blockchain. As compensation for locking up holdings, users receive regular rewards in a manner similar to interest payments. Staking is useful for blockchains that operate a <em>proof-of-stake (POS)</em> consensus mechanism. This is a different approach than <em>proof-of-work (POW), </em>which is the computationally intensive and expensive mechanism employed by bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash, and many other tangents of the original blockchain. Although POW has proven itself to be highly secure and effective in most cases, there are growing concerns about its energy usage and associated carbon footprint. In addition, POW blockchains have scalability and throughput issues (Bitcoin can only process a handful of transactions per second), while POS platforms can handle hundreds of thousands per second.Prominent stake-able protocols include Solana, Algorand, Cardano, Polkadot and Tezos.Additionally, while Ethereum remains a POW blockchain, it is possible to stake its native asset ether. This is because Ethereum is currently undergoing a multi-year transition from a POW to a POS consensus mechanism so that it can support the high demand for its computational resources.Please note that POS consensus mechanisms are not homogenous and each blockchain network may use a different way of calculating staking rewards, taking into account various factors such as:<strong><em>Yield Farming</em></strong>Aside from purchasing DeFi tokens, it is also possible to earn them through a process known as <strong>yield farming</strong><em>. </em>Yield farming can be thought of as DeFi 2.0. Before, when you would provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange or lending protocol, you’d simply earn a fee or earn some interest. However, last summer Compound<a aria-label=kickstarted a new trend that rewarded users with governance tokens class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/compound-extends-defi-ethos-to-itself-launches-governance-token href=https://www.coindesk.com/compound-extends-defi-ethos-to-itself-launches-governance-token rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/compound-extends-defi-ethos-to-itself-launches-governance-token> kickstarted a new trend that rewarded users with governance tokens</a>, COMP in this case, as an incentive program. Consistent with the decentralized ethos of the space, governance tokens are mechanisms for each protocol’s respective founders to cede control of the platform and turn it over to the users. In turn, token holders can use their ownership shares for additional rewards or vote on governance decisions that vary between protocols.In fact, so many governance tokens and yield farming opportunities were created that a group of DeFi portfolio managers were built to help shift user funds between opportunities so that they could maximize rewards and reduce transaction fees. Think Betterment or Wealthfront for crypto. One of the most prominent of these is <strong>yearn.finance</strong>, whose governance token YFI is valued at $28,000.<strong>COIN, Crypto Stocks And Other Crypto Securities</strong>When <strong>Coinbase (COIN)</strong> went public in April with the largest direct listing in U.S. history, many investors falsely believed that it was their first opportunity to gain crypto exposure through brokerage accounts. However, there are many publicly traded securities that have offered exposure to the crypto space for some time. I cannot mention them all here, but there are two primary categories to keep in mind.<strong><em>Exchange-Traded Products</em></strong>An ETP can be thought of as a packaging layer around an asset or group of assets such as bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which trades on an exchange like a security. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) like State Street’s SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF, are the most common form of exchange-traded product. Common exchanges where crypto ETPs can be found include OTCQX by OTC Markets, Nasdaq Nordic, CME Group (for crypto futures and options), Deutsche Börse’s Xetra, Swiss SIX Exchange and Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange. Funds traded on these foreign exchanges can often be accessed by most discount brokers, including Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or TD Ameritrade (though exact offerings differ by provider).  The biggest ETP provider is Grayscale, whose bitcoin trust (GBTC) is by far the industry’s largest fund available to investors by AUM (assets under management)—US$36.6 billion as of this writing. That said, while GBTC traded for a large premium to its net asset value for much of its existence, the onslaught of competition has caused its shares to sink to a double-digit discount for much of 2022.  Grayscale offers similarly structured products tracking other assets such as ether, litecoin, <strong>ethereum classic, </strong>solana and even some diversified indicies. But the crypto ETP market is far more than Grayscale. For instance, Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange has a robust roster of crypto ETPs exceeding 40 tickers, with the largest by trading volume being <strong>WisdomTree Bitcoin</strong> (BTCW.SW) and <strong>21Shares Ethereum ETP</strong> (AETH.SW). Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange launched North America’s first crypto ETFs in the first quarter of 2021: <strong>Purpose Bitcoin ETF</strong> (BTCC, AUM $1.4 billion)—which got off to a very strong start raising nearly US$1 billion in its first month—<strong>Evolve Bitcoin ETF</strong> (EBIT, AUM US$198 million) and <strong>CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF </strong>(BTCX, NAV $484.5 million).Additionally, October saw the launch of the U.S.’s first bitcoin ETFs. However, they do not reflect the spot price of bitcoin, but futures contracts that trade on platforms such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The first to launch in October was the <strong>ProShares Bitcoin ETF </strong>(BITO, AUM $1.25b billion. However, other offerings include the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF, AUM $98 million) and the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF, AUM $14.6 million). <strong> </strong><strong><em>Bitcoin Proxy Stocks</em></strong>It is also worth mentioning some of the stocks seen as a proxy for bitcoin. Business analytics firm <strong>MicroStrategy</strong> is seen as a leader in the space given its status as the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world (121,000 bitcoins). However, there are also many publicly traded bitcoin mining firms (companies that run complex computers used to add transactions to the bitcoin network) that have seen dramatic levels of interest during the recent bitcoin price run. Some of the more prominent ones in the U.S. include <strong>Marathon Digital Holdings</strong> and <strong>Riot Blockchain</strong>.<strong>How To Buy And Hold Crypto</strong>Aside from making investment decisions, many of you will have questions about the specific mechanics of crypto investing. This is somewhat novel to the industry because there are few options to buy crypto assets from traditional brokerage or wealth management accounts. Fortunately, it has never been easier to buy and sell crypto. In the early days of bitcoin, purchasers had to wire money around the world to unregulated exchanges without any guarantees of receiving their bitcoin or a refund. Today we have a wide variety of providers that have gone to great lengths to make their products easy to use.For instance, in the U.S. alone there is a wide variety of secure and regulated exchanges that offer simple onboarding procedures for new clients. Some of the biggest and most widely used include Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini. They each have easy to use websites and mobile applications.Additionally, as the space has grown many non-crypto native platforms and financial applications such as Square, Robinhood, Revolut and PayPal have enabled crypto trading. The added benefit of these platforms is that you do not need to do any additional onboarding if you are already a client of theirs.Once you’ve bought crypto, you need to keep it safe. Virtually all the regulated platforms recommended for first-time buyers will provide software wallets (similar to mobile banking applications) that are reasonably secure. You can trust that they have been built by experienced software developers and security professionals. The security of these applications can be further enhanced by taking a few basic steps:For institutions, there are also a growing suite of OTC desks, prime brokers and service providers such as Fidelity that can support the individual trading, security and reporting needs for those purchasers.Finally, here are some important questions that you should ask yourself as you get ready to purchase crypto:<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am director of research for digital assets at Forbes.

It's going to be ugly.The bitcoin and crypto market has rocketed over the last year, soaring amid a wider equity and asset price rally. Bitcoin has gone from a combined value of just $400 billion this time 12 months ago to around $1 trillion today.[The crypto market] is somewhere over $2 trillion. When the dot com bubble burst, those dot com stocks were worth like half a billion dollars. Inflation-adjusted that's like $1 trillion in today's dollars. Most of those stocks became worthless, said Payne.Many smaller cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and its biggest rivals Binance's BNB, solana and cardano, have made even greater percentage gains than bitcoin, climbing at a blistering pace as investors pile into the market—in part thanks to the massive financial stimulus programs launched by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to offset the economic damage done by Covid-19 lockdowns. There's too much money out there that can funnel into this market. It's just becoming a bigger and bigger casino, said Payne. At the end of the day, we're not using it for that much more commercial use. It's just more people speculating and I think it's very analogous to when the tech bubble burst or you go back to the housing bubble ... where everybody's involved.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has soared over the last year, though the likes of ethereum, Binance's BNB, <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Analysts weigh in on whether bitcoin is headed for a Santa Claus rally. 3d illustrationBitcoin prices have had an interesting several days, plunging over the weekend and then bouncing back above the $50,000 level. Taking these recent movements into account, and considering that 2021 is coming to a close, several analysts have weighed in on whether the world’s most prominent digital currency will experience a so-called <a aria-label=Santa Claus rally class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/santaclauseffect.asp href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/santaclauseffect.asp rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/santaclauseffect.asp>Santa Claus rally</a>, climbing during the last few weeks of this year and the start of the next one.

[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]John Iadeluca, founder &amp; CEO of multi-strategy fund <a aria-label=Banz Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.banz.capital/ href=https://www.banz.capital/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.banz.capital/>Banz Capital</a>, responded to Stockton’s observation. “In reference to historical data, yes, the MACD signal would reduce the chances that Bitcoin will experience a Christmas-time Rally.” “However, I believe it’s important for any analysts to know that while evaluating the odds of any year-end rally in Bitcoin price, that identifying the ‘events’ used to calculate any said odds is crucial towards any evaluation or projection of Bitcoin's price.” Ben Armstrong, founder of<a aria-label=BitBoy Crypto class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitboycrypto.com/ href=https://bitboycrypto.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitboycrypto.com/> BitBoy Crypto</a>, also weighed in. “The weekly MACD signals mirroring the lead up to the May crash is a challenge for Bitcoin this late in the year,” he stated. “At most I can see an upswing to $90k but that is only in a very bullish scenario.” “Traders need to be very careful now that we may be facing an extended bull run,” said Armstrong. “Regardless, Bitcoin hitting $100k is inevitable.” Scott Melker, a crypto investor and analyst who is the host of <a aria-label=The Wolf Of All Streets Podcast class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.thewolfofallstreets.io/podcast/ href=https://www.thewolfofallstreets.io/podcast/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.thewolfofallstreets.io/podcast/>The Wolf Of All Streets Podcast</a>, offered some perspective on the matter, focusing on the significance of the recent sell-off and technical indicators besides the MACD. “While the Bitcoin correction appears to largely be a result of a single large spot seller triggering a liquidation cascade in the leverage market, it cannot be dismissed as meaningless,” he said. “Bitcoin is now trading between two critical levels - 53K and 42K, although one could argue that $39,600 is the more significant support, because a break would signal a lower low and a break in macro bullish market structure,” he added. “Unless prices can convincingly break 53K and flip it to support, one can expect for Bitcoin to continue to range through Christmas and beyond,” said Melker. “RSI has not yet reached oversold on the daily chart, which could indicate that more shorter term downside is possible,” he noted. “There’s nothing overtly bearish on the chart, but the likelihood of an immediate rally has been diminished.”Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager <a aria-label=Valkyrie Investments class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://valkyrieinvest.com/ href=https://valkyrieinvest.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://valkyrieinvest.com/>Valkyrie Investments</a>, also weighed in on bitcoin’s short-term outlook. “After spot selling led to cascading liquidations on offshore derivative platforms over the weekend, the overall Bitcoin marketplace finds itself in a healthier state with drastically less open interest,” he stated. “The price of bitcoin breached the 200-day moving average, but rebounded strongly to over 20 percent from the low,” said Rooney. “A rally to a new all-time high isn’t likely before the end of the year, however it wouldn’t be surprising to see Bitcoin return to it's previous range between $53,000 and $60,000.” Sylvia Jablonski, cofounder and chief investment officer for ETF sponsor <a aria-label=Defiance ETFs class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.defianceetfs.com/ href=https://www.defianceetfs.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.defianceetfs.com/>Defiance ETFs</a>, took a different approach, speaking to the broader developments affecting the global asset markets. “Today’s rebound (10K off of last weekend’s 42k lows), tells me that Santa Claus may indeed be coming to town,” she said. “Bitcoin and crypto seem to have reacted to the same three headwind forces impacting equity markets. Omicron, Inflation and the taper led to uncertainty in risk assets across the board, and crypto was not able to escape it,” emphasized Jablonski. “I continue to invest in equities because I believe that the economic recovery is stable to strong, 4.2% unemployment tells me that it does make sense to have less fiscal and monetary stimulus, and so tapering may be appropriate, and Omicron so far is sounding manageable, or less of a threat than detected.” “I continue to invest in Crypto for those same reasons, but also because I believe that the crypto ecosystem is continuing to grow, international adoption continues, funds investing in crypto are on the rise which leads to demand and AUM, and it has become understood and accepted among the general population.”<em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Digital cryptocurrencies have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. (Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images)</span>A crypto flash-crash on Saturday attributed to Omicron uncertainty, fears of further Fed tapering, and a $500 million bitcoin sale that triggered cascading liquidations caused bitcoin to reach a low of $42,330, while ether dipped to $3,575 before both currencies partially recovered – they are presently trading at $51,500 and $4,358, respectively. There were some warning signals. For instance, in a <a aria-label=piece class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2021/12/02/omicron-risk-unlocks-profit-for-retail-traders-shorting-bitcoin href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2021/12/02/omicron-risk-unlocks-profit-for-retail-traders-shorting-bitcoin target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2021/12/02/omicron-risk-unlocks-profit-for-retail-traders-shorting-bitcoin>piece</a> published two days before the drop in prices, a Forbes analysis of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) weekly detailed how wealthy retail traders took out a heavy short position collectively worth $500 million at the same time Omicron was capturing headlines. The notional sum of this bet was not sufficiently large to move tens of billions of dollar’s worth of bitcoin daily trading volume, but it was an indicator of the overall negative sentiment going into the weekend and its notorious thin liquidity. That said, these traders did not exactly profit from the weekend’s fall in prices.The latest CFTC Commitments of Traders (COT) report released on Sunday confirms that the retail traders in the big-short story ultimately lacked bearish conviction - the abnormally large retail short positions closed by Tuesday November 30. Retail traders placed their short while bitcoin was in the $56,000 to $60,500 range and closed it somewhere within the $53,000 to $59,000 range, meaning that they could have earned a small profit. This bet’s short timeframe is in line with a slightly longer one seen in October when this same group initiated a large buy (long) bitcoin position. These traders appear to follow an agnostic long/short trading approach, lasting one to two weeks. This contrasts for example with asset managers who these days are long-only. Total bitcoin futures open interest held by retail traders at the CME Exchange, in number of <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> contracts</span><strong>Winners and Losers Sometimes Revealed</strong>So if retail traders didn’t exactly profit from the major volatility, who may have done so? The answer appears to be commercial traders, which are expert financial intermediaries who help third parties offset trading risk and in this instance could have scored opportunistically. In something of a rare instance of counterparty transparency, last week’s data showed the likely trading counterparty of retail traders for the big sell (short) positions, something that is hard to know because it is an electronic, anonymous market. All futures trading at the CME exchange requires that buy orders at a given price be matched to seller orders. For the said retail drop in short contracts, another entity had to more or less simultaneously close long contracts and/or boost their short position. The latest Forbes analysis showed how commercial traders cut back long bitcoin futures (see reduction in spread open interest contracts) and boosted shorts by an equivalent number of contracts that short retail traders reduced. The biggest winners this past week in the futures market were, nonetheless, hedge funds. But they could not have realized a profit until the futures market opened on Sunday at 6PM Eastern time, but by then bitcoin had bounced back to $47,000 from its $42,330 low.CME Bitcoin Futures open interest contracts held by various trader groups, in number of contracts.<strong>Outlook</strong>Bitcoin is not out of the woods yet and is subject to selloffs in the broader market, but sentiment improved as it became known that the El Salvadorian government bought the dip in bitcoin price. From a technical perspective, the recent $42,330 low was higher than the most recent low of $39,600 on Sep 21 and this bodes well for bitcoin bulls who are likely to stage a gradual challenge to the $55,000 and $60,000 levels before year end. It is appropriate to note that it is precisely in times like these – when an attractive asset undergoes temporary volatility but remains on an upward trend – that shrewd long term investors can buy attractive securities on the cheap.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices rose above $50,000 after their recent sell-off. After experiencing a rough weekend where bitcoin prices suffered a notable sell-off, the digital currency has bounced back, surpassing $50,000 late this afternoon. Now that the prominent cryptocurrency has risen above this level, technical analysts and market observers are watching and waiting to see whether it will establish support there. The digital asset climbed above $50,000 around 4:45 p.m. EST, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. After breaking through this price level, bitcoin rose to $50,580, before falling back to roughly $49,970 slightly before 5 p.m. EST, additional CoinDesk figures reveal.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]The cryptocurrency once again rose above $50,000, reaching as much as $50,965.03 close to 6 p.m. EST. Following these price movements, several analysts weighed in on the implications of these latest developments.“Reclaiming $50,000 is great for Bitcoin’s prospects of resuming bullish price action,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a aria-label=BitBull Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ href=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/>BitBull Capital</a>. “However, it needs to maintain this as a support and move towards $53k, $55k, $58k and finally $60k to truly invalidate any bearish momentum this year.” David Keller, chief market strategist at <a aria-label=StockCharts.com class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://stockcharts.com/ href=https://stockcharts.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://stockcharts.com/>StockCharts.com</a>, also weighed in. “At this point, remaining above $50K is key to the bullish thesis with 58-60K a likely resistance range given the late November highs and the 50-day moving average,” he stated. However, should bitcoin fall below that level, Keller shed some light on key support and resistance the digital currency could encounter. “Bitcoin has tended to find support and resistance and big round numbers like $30K in July/July and $40K in September,” he stated. “Given the strength of the deterioration over the last four weeks, prices could certainly continue lower to these key levels.” “I would add that over the weekend Bitcoin bounced off the 200-day moving average, which may be another important level of support as the market processes the recent selloff.” Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for <a aria-label=Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://gerberkawasaki.com/ href=https://gerberkawasaki.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://gerberkawasaki.com/>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management</a>, also spoke to the situation. “It’s clear that the Bitcoin market was shocked a bit with the massive liquidations over the weekend and broke the $50,000 support,” he stated. “It’s since bounced off the lows,” at which point it started fighting to reach $50,000 once again, said Sifling. “It looks like Bitcoin has spiked over $50,000 in the last hour or two,” he said this evening. “We will need to see it consolidate and build a new base over $50,000 before we can confirm that it’s officially broken above that resistance.” He emphasized that “If we consolidate and build a new base above $50,000, the next resistance” is at $53,000. “If the selling continues, we’ll be watching the $40,000 support from back in October and the $30,000 major support level that was built in June and July,” Sifling added. <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

There is consideration of the morality of bitcoin as well as the soundness of investment. Seldom is there the ability to make a direct comparison between their support of what fills their wallets otherwise and their position, however — except for in the case of Charlie Munger and investors like him.The 97-year old Berkshire Hathaway partner has long been a skeptic of cryptocurrencies. Claiming that China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining and transaction exchanges was good because it reined in the “excesses of capitalism”, he extolled his admiration for a exchanges ban and then a mining ban that was a half-hearted attempt to shut down a global, open-source network. He has been on record as saying that he hates “the Bitcoin success”, a “currency that’s useful for kidnappers and extortionists and so forth”. This dovetails with <a aria-label=his remarks on the Chinese system class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/business/munger-china-economy/index.html href=https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/business/munger-china-economy/index.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/business/munger-china-economy/index.html>his remarks on the Chinese system</a> performing better for the Chinese in using “tougher methods than we could use under our Constitution” — assumably an euphemism for the state-sponsored massacre of working-class protesters around Tiananmen Square, the mass surveillance and detainment of ethnic minorities (including, but not limited, to Tibetans and Uyghurs), and the complete consolidation of Chinese Communist Party privilege and power in protecting against both sexual harassment claims and <a aria-label=familial corruption class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite>familial corruption</a> from non-Party elite — not to mention the <a aria-label=kidnapping of nationals from around the world for the extortion of Party goals class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/canada/trudeau-china-huawei-meng-wanzhou.html href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/canada/trudeau-china-huawei-meng-wanzhou.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/canada/trudeau-china-huawei-meng-wanzhou.html>kidnapping of nationals from around the world for the extortion of Party goals</a>. These are not just words. This comes with significant levels of investment in <a aria-label=Chinese companies class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/08/charlie-munger-plays-berkshires-hand-in-china-bet-and-seeks-more-opportunities.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/08/charlie-munger-plays-berkshires-hand-in-china-bet-and-seeks-more-opportunities.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/08/charlie-munger-plays-berkshires-hand-in-china-bet-and-seeks-more-opportunities.html>Chinese companies</a> and always pushing Berkshire to “do more in China” according to his long-time partner Warren Buffett. Yet, Munger mistakes the current Chinese system as beneficial for all Chinese peoples rather than just investors like him, and speaks with two voices here. On the one hand, he “prefers” democracy and the American system at least for the American people. Yet on the other, he extolls and prefers that the United States conducts itself in the same anti-democratic fashion as is typical of the Chinese Communist Party: congratulating the “muzzling” of <a aria-label=Alibaba’s Jack Ma class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/charlie-munger-communists-did-the-right-thing-in-muzzling-jack-ma/ar-AALCRZU href=https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/charlie-munger-communists-did-the-right-thing-in-muzzling-jack-ma/ar-AALCRZU rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/charlie-munger-communists-did-the-right-thing-in-muzzling-jack-ma/ar-AALCRZU>Alibaba’s Jack Ma</a> — at least “in the financial sector”. One would not be amiss to wonder how true his words about supporting democracy ring and his strand of thought in ringfencing the way the Chinese state deals with financial matters while setting aside the consolidated source of that power. Given that bitcoin is a system of participatory democracy (with an interplay between code contributors, miners, and other stakeholders) with a strong binding set of covenants based on principle (ex: the hard constraint of 21 million bitcoin), it may be clearer why Munger might think of it as “rat poison” now. On this front, both the Chinese Communist Party and Munger are aligned. What could be more threatening to a system that wants complete control over the past, present and future than a truly internationalized hedge against financial surveillance standards, anti-censorship of funds, and the truth-sayers it can empower? The answer: a system like bitcoin that prides itself on first principles for eliminating arbitrary and powerful intermediaries that may no longer be needed.What does “transparency for the powerful, privacy for the weak” mean for a ruling elite that uses anti-corruption campaigns to settle scores, where the slightest tendril of truth uncovers murders, elite children fraternizing with drunk prostitutes, and immense family stakes in state-owned companies? And what does that mean for those who have blinded themselves to these facts, and who hold their money and financial trust in the hands of that same consolidated elite, a ruling caste that maintains its power through factors like family history rather than explicit, fair consent across a broad public — democracy, in other words? Munger’s money talks louder than his words, in any case, on the conditions of the “excesses of capitalism” that he decries. It’s bubbling asset prices that make it hard for “value investors” like him that matter: left unsaid (but certainly invested) are the conditions of the “excesses of state-driven capitalism” that keep his investments in China safe and which are typical of the heavy-handed approach the Chinese state uses for economics: the detainment of labor and <a aria-label=feminist activists class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.yahoo.com/now/not-just-peng-china-cracking-010104605.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAASETUXbyDZ9H9_NLm1FVP6Qs9XJKjELYTF1X2DV8JYb5B3Yy9voBn-23fYXje-RTjXeDOqobCMSwSLxQnaHcgXXIXHmnbrMkPTITOCuwjxZOvlZ22o3s13suZZgjLBP14NPATgDnhkUM73vw2wzGy5FW3ZXSKof2ohogGu7kiTD href=https://www.yahoo.com/now/not-just-peng-china-cracking-010104605.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAASETUXbyDZ9H9_NLm1FVP6Qs9XJKjELYTF1X2DV8JYb5B3Yy9voBn-23fYXje-RTjXeDOqobCMSwSLxQnaHcgXXIXHmnbrMkPTITOCuwjxZOvlZ22o3s13suZZgjLBP14NPATgDnhkUM73vw2wzGy5FW3ZXSKof2ohogGu7kiTD rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.yahoo.com/now/not-just-peng-china-cracking-010104605.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAASETUXbyDZ9H9_NLm1FVP6Qs9XJKjELYTF1X2DV8JYb5B3Yy9voBn-23fYXje-RTjXeDOqobCMSwSLxQnaHcgXXIXHmnbrMkPTITOCuwjxZOvlZ22o3s13suZZgjLBP14NPATgDnhkUM73vw2wzGy5FW3ZXSKof2ohogGu7kiTD>feminist activists</a> including a wave of young women concerned about #MeToo in China (我也是), <a aria-label=income inequality class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/19/6928.full.pdf href=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/19/6928.full.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/19/6928.full.pdf>income inequality</a> that has exceeded astronomically high levels in the United States thanks to the Party’s rigid enforcement of location-based economic castes, social anomie and <a aria-label=the decay of the social fabric class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0268580918812281 href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0268580918812281 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0268580918812281>the decay of the social fabric</a> in China — and complete oversight from the Party, which means, among other things, imprisoning dissenting voices and ethnicities. Leaving that aside however (and it is quite something to leave any of it aside), Munger uses the curious and utilitarian example of China’s one-child rule as an example of state control that has led to great success. Yet, right as China is now looking to enter another phase of economic development, <a aria-label=it is also getting older class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://chinapower.csis.org/aging-problem/ href=https://chinapower.csis.org/aging-problem/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://chinapower.csis.org/aging-problem/>it is also getting older</a> than any country in modern history largely due to 36 years of the one-child policy. With the fertility rate below replacement rate and so far a lukewarm approach to the culture and policy required for global immigration (which has helped slow the United States from demographic decline), we may be seeing the consequences of this freedom-stifling policy in real time — not only as morally questionable, but as bad policy. What Munger and investors like him seem to fail to understand is that bitcoin is not only about approaching freedom and financial access from a first principles standpoint, using human discretion over technology governed by consent from humans across the system — it is also a practical refutation of the idea that mass-scale control with long-tail consequences over unpredictable data is “sound”. China’s techno-nationalist rise is premised on a state-biased flavour of technology — using large and exhaustive data sets stored safely in domestic borders, some a result of extensive state and firm surveillance, and a careful count of computational resources under centralized control to leapfrog countries in the West it considers too comfortable to do anything much about this state of affairs. Bitcoin, an open-source technology where anybody can participate, and an internationalized one at that, is a direct affront to the level of financial surveillance and individual-level controls the digital yuan (in the form of individual-level interest rates, for example) might offer — and is also a philosophical hedge against exactly this model, promoting with it encryption, individual consent, and a system that doesn’t favor any Party elite in economics or otherwise. Bitcoin, in its blending of many voices and perspectives across a broad spectrum, is more akin to the <a aria-label=bottoms-up of Bach class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/08/after-the-cultural-revolution-what-western-classical-music-means-in-china href=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/08/after-the-cultural-revolution-what-western-classical-music-means-in-china rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/08/after-the-cultural-revolution-what-western-classical-music-means-in-china>bottoms-up of Bach</a>, a set of solitudes brought together into harmonious concert by game theory, rather than the trumpting, blaring and triumphal tone typical of Beethoven. In its subtle nature, it allows for Wall Street to invest in decentralization as Wall Street has invested in Chinese Marxism. By eroding the level of control states can have to execute this level of control over the financial health of their peoples, bitcoin is a technological and philosophical refutation of the model of governance and shaky, repression-biased, and anti-democratic methodology the Chinese Communist Party favors — and which Munger seems more comfortable with than the democratizing technology of bitcoin. “Rat poison” indeed.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I was one of the first writers in 2014 to write about the intersection of cryptocurrencies in remittance payments and drug policy with VentureBeat and TechCrunch.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"<em>(Part One)</em> Commissioner Dawn Stump of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lays out what exactly it means that Bitcoin is a commodity - and what she has publicly described as the ‘fallacy’ of the question as to whether other blockchain tokens are a commodity or a security. According to Stump, “there has often been a grossly inaccurate oversimplification offered which suggests these are either securities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or commodities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.” Stump has been on a campaign to set the record straight by issuing “concurring statements” whenever an enforcement action against digital assets is announced by the CFTC. Stump does not dispute the wrongdoing that occurred, but rather seeks to help the public better understand the true regulatory perimeter of the agency around digital assets. Stump publicly released <a aria-label=10 concise points class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement082321 href=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement082321 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement082321>10 concise points</a> in an attempt to correct what she views as misperceptions and guide policymakers toward what really matters when it comes to digital asset regulation. “The prevalence of this misunderstanding about U.S. regulatory delineations has grown to a point that I believe requires correction,” said Stump. In addition, Stump has been issuing <a aria-label=concurring statements class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement031921 href=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement031921 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement031921>concurring statements</a> to ensure the public does not end up with a false sense of security as to the extent of the regulatory perimeter for the fast-growing digital asset marketplace. Commissioner Dawn DeBerry Stump of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) As Congress considers legislation aimed at providing regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry, Stump is not alone in her concerns either. Former Chair of the CFTC (and Harvard) Timothy Massad stated in a hearing titled “Demystifying Crypto: Digital Assets and the Role of Government” that, “the CFTC only regulates derivatives contracts - the CFTC can’t regulate the cash market of bitcoin any more than it can regulate the sale of cows because it regulates cattle futures...Even one of the Republican Commissioners said this is going to mislead the public into thinking that we regulate these exchanges and we don’t.”<strong>Concurring Statements Stump Made In 2021 On Digital Assets </strong>In March 0f 2021, the <a aria-label=CFTC ordered Coinbase Inc. to pay $6.5 million class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21 href=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21>CFTC ordered Coinbase Inc. to pay $6.5 million</a> for false, misleading, or inaccurate reporting and wash trading.

It does not.” In October of 2021, the CFTC ordered <a aria-label=Tether and Bitfinex to pay fines totaling $42.5 million class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21 href=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21>Tether and Bitfinex to pay fines totaling $42.5 million</a>. Yet again, Stump’s <a aria-label=concurring statement class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement101521 href=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement101521 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement101521>concurring statement</a> points out, “However, because this is the first time the CFTC has applied the CEA’s broad definition of “commodity” to a stablecoin, I wish to reiterate my concern that enforcement actions such as this involving digital assets may cause confusion about the CFTC’s role in this area.” Jonathan Marcus, Partner at Reed Smith LLP and former General Counsel at the CFTC said, “The CFTC has the authority in the spot markets to go after fraud and manipulation and has done that in a number of instances”. Marcus also said, “the CFTC generally has no authority to issue rules to regulate the spot market. The ability to set up front rules to govern a marketplace can protect against fraud and manipulation.” Marcus noted that this means the current (crypto assets) market is not fully regulated up front and lacks things such as registration and disclosure requirements. Olta Andoni, Adjunct Professor of Law at Chicago Kent College of Law and former Chief Legal Officer of Nifty’s, stated I definitely agree with Commissioner Stump- this type of confusion among the public exists and clarifying the extent to which the CFTC can be involved in the digital asset marketplace is crucial.Bitcoin cryptocurrency coin and the green line of a graph are pictured in Kyiv on 29 July, 2021. <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> (Photo by STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</span>The question with respect to digital assets such as Bitcoin - after better understanding the role of the CFTC as laid out by Stump - is then to determine as to whether there needs to be any additional regulations for the marketplace.

Peckshield reckons the losses to be $100 million in various cryptocurrencies on the ethereum blockchain and $96 million on Binance smart chain.<strong>How was it done:</strong> The hacker has been systematically using decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch to swap the stolen assets for the ethereum's ether and using a secondary address to deposit the ether into privacy mixer Tornado Cash, making the hacked funds harder to track, <a aria-label=Coindesk class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112061225:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/13b37b27?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2Mzg3OTM2MTQsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYWUwMTcwMWJkMDU2MGQzZTI4ZjM1MSIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbVwvYnVzaW5lc3NcLzIwMjFcLzEyXC8wNVwvY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlLWJpdG1hcnQtaGFja2VkLXdpdGgtbG9zc2VzLWVzdGltYXRlZC1hdC0xOTYtbWlsbGlvblwvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=_TRBbLqpFbszN0KnTabhaR96oUIZNheQU7jLDoTsFQM href=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112061225:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/13b37b27?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2Mzg3OTM2MTQsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYWUwMTcwMWJkMDU2MGQzZTI4ZjM1MSIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbVwvYnVzaW5lc3NcLzIwMjFcLzEyXC8wNVwvY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlLWJpdG1hcnQtaGFja2VkLXdpdGgtbG9zc2VzLWVzdGltYXRlZC1hdC0xOTYtbWlsbGlvblwvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=_TRBbLqpFbszN0KnTabhaR96oUIZNheQU7jLDoTsFQM target=_self title=https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112061225:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/13b37b27?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2Mzg3OTM2MTQsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYWUwMTcwMWJkMDU2MGQzZTI4ZjM1MSIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbVwvYnVzaW5lc3NcLzIwMjFcLzEyXC8wNVwvY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlLWJpdG1hcnQtaGFja2VkLXdpdGgtbG9zc2VzLWVzdGltYXRlZC1hdC0xOTYtbWlsbGlvblwvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=_TRBbLqpFbszN0KnTabhaR96oUIZNheQU7jLDoTsFQM><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://e.email.forbes.com/c2/869:60bf7bc1fe2c195e91692a1d:rm202112061225:5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a:1/13b37b27?jwtH=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9&amp;jwtP=eyJpYXQiOjE2Mzg3OTM2MTQsImNkIjoiLmVtYWlsLmZvcmJlcy5jb20iLCJjZSI6ODY0MDAsInRrIjoiZm9yYmVzLWxpdmUiLCJtdGxJRCI6IjYxYWUwMTcwMWJkMDU2MGQzZTI4ZjM1MSIsImxpbmtVcmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbVwvYnVzaW5lc3NcLzIwMjFcLzEyXC8wNVwvY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlLWJpdG1hcnQtaGFja2VkLXdpdGgtbG9zc2VzLWVzdGltYXRlZC1hdC0xOTYtbWlsbGlvblwvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10ayZjZGxjaWQ9NWQ2N2UwMWYxOTUwNjNmYTRmNjUzNDFhIn0&amp;jwtS=_TRBbLqpFbszN0KnTabhaR96oUIZNheQU7jLDoTsFQM>Coindesk</em></a> explained.<strong>Why it matters:</strong> The $200 million worth of cryptocurrencies lost makes this one of the biggest centralized exchange hacks to date.

Dec 6 2021 07:45am ,"Terraform Lab’s Luna cryptocurrency is now one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, rocketing past popular dog-based meme tokens Shiba Inu and dogecoin despite a market-wide selloff that erased hundreds of billions in value over two days and saw prices of major cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and cardano, drop double-digit percentages. Terra's luna became a top ten cryptocurrency by market cap. Terra’s luna was trading at $61.05 a token Monday morning, down nearly 20% from a record high of $77.73 on Sunday but still up 22% over the past seven days, according to <a aria-label=CoinGecko class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coingecko.com/en href=https://www.coingecko.com/en rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coingecko.com/en>CoinGecko</a>.Luna’s gains mean the token’s market capitalization jumped to around $23.6 billion, overtaking dogecoin to become the tenth most valuable cryptocurrency.Luna’s soaring value comes amid a widespread selloff that wiped more than $300 billion from the cryptocurrency market in two days.Luna was one of just two top-20 tokens not pegged to other assets to defy the rout—Polygon’s matic, now the 16th-most valuable cryptocurrency, also gained 7.8% over the last week—with the majority of major tokens down double-digit percentages.The price of bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency and nearly 40% of the crypto market, fell 16.8% over the last seven days, with ether (down 7.5%), Binance’s BNB (9.9%), solana (10.5%), cardano (19.5%), XRP (21%) and polkadot (28.6%) also plummeting.Cryptocurrencies are a notoriously volatile set of assets and even those at the very top of the market like bitcoin and ether are not immune to wild and rapid fluctuations. Bitcoin, for example, is trading at around $47,600, down from a record high of just over $69,000 a few weeks ago. A good chunk of that was lost in the last week and some top-ten cryptocurrencies—polkadot and solana—shed more than 10% in value over the last 24 hours.

Helping you understand the world of bitcoin and crypto, every weekday</strong>The bitcoin and crypto market has crashed this week, losing over $300 billion from its total value <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> as the price of ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, cardano, Ripple's XRP, and dogecoin plummeted. </span>The bitcoin, ethereum and broader crypto price crash has been put down to fears over the spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19 and expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve could accelerate its plans to ease its loose monetary policy in the face of soaring inflation and a robust jobs market. Digital assets got pushed around by the broader risk-off conditions related to Omicron and expectations of a more aggressive Fed but didn’t properly sell-off until Friday, on contagion from equities, Martha Reyes, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant, said in emailed comments.This week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hit its highest level since January as investors balked at the perceived increased risk, though Reyes expects the uncertainty to be short-lived. It is rare for the VIX to have such big spikes and usually the market goes on to have positive returns over one to six month periods, as the panic and forced selling from OmniFed subsides—as we saw last January, Reyes added.Others have spotted similarities with the March 2020 pandemic market crash and this week's equity and crypto sell-off—with the market quickly bouncing from panicked lows.The current situation resembles closely what happened in March 2020 as we’re seeing equities plunge 5% off recent highs and the negativity is spreading to other markets as well including the digital asset markets, Anto Paroian, chief operations officer, at crypto hedge fund Ark36, said via email, pointing to as well to wild bitcoin price swings over the summer and how well the market rebounded afterward.However, Paroian warned the bitcoin and crypto market could be headed for more pain in the coming weeks and months as volatility spooks traders. One of the key bitcoin bull market indicators—the 20-week simple moving average—has now been decisively breached so the outlook is currently bearish in the short to medium term. What’s potentially worrying in the short term is that the market still seems oversaturated with leverage which creates conditions where the corrections we’ve just seen are likely to repeat.The crypto market is still largely led by bitcoin's price movements, with bitcoin's fortunes dictating the wider market. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by value, with a market capitalization of around $1 trillion. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has a combined value of some $500 billion and between them make up well over half of the $2.2 trillion crypto market. However, bitcoin's dominance, a measure of bitcoin's value compared to the wider market has dropped over the last year as smaller coins make outsized gains thanks to the non-fungible token (NFT) craze and surging interest in decentralized finance (DeFi)—using crypto technology to recreate traditional financial services without the need for banks.Ethereum, the biggest NFT and DeFi platform—along with its major rivals Binance's BNB, solana and cardano—have all added triple-digit percentages in recent months, and some bullish investors expect them to continue to climb. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has lost around 20% over the last month, plunging bitcoin into a technical bear <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

In times of volatility, in which there are lower entry points to top up portfolios, they typically continue to drip-feed money into the digital assets market.Green expects solana, the ethereum rival that's soared almost 10,000% since this time last year, to outperform both bitcoin and ethereum in 2022. [Solana is] likely [to] outperform both bitcoin and ethereum again next year, added Green, pointing to solana's cost-effectiveness and momentum driven by a booming DeFi space as retail investors seek alternative funding opportunities and institutional investors continue to pile in.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices have had a turbulent 48 hours. Bitcoin prices have suffered some intense volatility lately, falling to their lowest since September. The digital currency reached $42,019.86 yesterday, <a aria-label=CoinDesk figures class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk figures</a> show. At this point, the cryptocurrency was down close to 40% from the all-time high of nearly $69,000 it reached last month, additional CoinDesk data reveals.When explaining this sharp decline, several analysts pointed to spot selling. The downward price movement that resulted fueled a long squeeze, creating further losses, CoinDesk <a aria-label=reported class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/04/bitcoin-drops-9k-in-an-hour/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/04/bitcoin-drops-9k-in-an-hour/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/04/bitcoin-drops-9k-in-an-hour/>reported</a>. Since that time, the digital asset has bounced back, repeatedly moving toward $50,000 both yesterday and today. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Following these latest price movements, several technical analysts weighed in on the key levels of support and resistance that market observers should watch going forward. <strong>Crucial Resistance Levels</strong>Ben McMillan, CIO at <a aria-label=IDX Digital Assets class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://idxdigitalassets.com/ href=https://idxdigitalassets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://idxdigitalassets.com/>IDX Digital Assets</a>, commented on the matter, stating that $50k will be a key psychological level that bitcoin bulls will be eyeing to see if bitcoin can bounce back into $50k territory quickly and hold.” “After that, $53k has been the key level that saw some resistance back in September as well as during the rally in October,” he stated. Armando Aguilar, vice president of Digital Assets Strategy for <a aria-label=Fundstrat Global Advisors class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://fundstrat.com/ href=https://fundstrat.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://fundstrat.com/>Fundstrat Global Advisors</a>, also pointed out the key levels bitcoin could hit if it keeps rising. “Tradingview.com indicators show us that [the] resistance area is at $52k - $53k, if resistance breaks those levels we see the next resistance level coming around $57k-$58k.” Aguilar also spoke to recent improvement in the <a aria-label=Relative Strength Index class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp>Relative Strength Index</a>, a momentum indicator that analysts use to get a better sense of whether an asset is either oversold or overbought. “RSI saw a higher low despite the market downturn,” he stated. “This is important because it provided a good sign for the speed of recovery.” <strong>Important Support Levels</strong>Experts also shed some light on where bitcoin could go if traders push it lower. “As predicted, after breaking below the daily Ichimoku cloud, Bitcoin's price touched on two out of three key psychological levels traced by Fibonacci on Saturday before correcting some of the losses,” said Kiana Danial, CEO of <a aria-label=Invest Diva class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investdiva.com/ href=https://www.investdiva.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investdiva.com/>Invest Diva</a>. The indicator she mentioned, the <a aria-label=Ichimoku cloud class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp>Ichimoku cloud</a>, takes several averages and incorporates them into a single chart, which then displays an asset’s trend, momentum, support and resistance. “On Sunday, the BTC/USD pair opened below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $49,500,” she stated. “This indicates the bearish momentum has not completely stopped yet.” “The key support levels following the Fibonacci retracement strategy are now at $44,800 and $40,700, with the neckline of the potential long-term double top chart pattern laying on $31K.”McMillan also commented on important price levels the world’s most prominent digital currency could encounter if it pushed lower. “On the downside, $47-$48k is the support level that bulls would want to see hold. If bitcoin breaks back below that threshold, then it could re-test $40k-$42k quickly,” he stated.Aguilar also offered some input on the matter, noting that “Traders should keep a close eye on resistance levels of $52k - $53k as it may lead to market over reaction and retest levels in the mid $40ks.” Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner of <a aria-label=Fairlead Strategies, LLC class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/ href=https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/>Fairlead Strategies, LLC</a>, provided additional perspective on bitcoin’s recent price movements and outlook, suggesting that traders use a “wait and see” approach in a <a aria-label=tweet class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/StocktonKatie/status/1467141118739496968 href=https://twitter.com/StocktonKatie/status/1467141118739496968 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/StocktonKatie/status/1467141118739496968>tweet</a> she posted yesterday. “An overnight downdraft has #bitcoin below widely watched $53K support - rarely a good idea to sell into this kind of move, rather wait to see if the breakdown is confirmed (we will know by Monday),” she wrote. <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices fell below $53,000 several times today. Bitcoin prices suffered significant declines today, falling to their lowest in nearly two months and repeatedly dropping below $53,000, a level that has been identified as providing key support. The world’s most valuable digital currency by market value reached as little as $51,808.54 this afternoon, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. At this point, it was trading at its lowest level since October 6, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. Following this decline, the cryptocurrency bounced back, rising above $54,000, before continually falling below $53,000 this evening.At the time of this writing, the digital asset was trading close to $53,000. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Several analysts spoke to this particular level, emphasizing its importance. “The support near $53K is important to us too, but so far it is still intact,” said Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner of <a aria-label=Fairlead Strategies, LLC class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/ href=https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.fairleadstrategies.com/>Fairlead Strategies, LLC</a>. “Today’s weakness may have been sparked by the negative momentum behind high-growth stocks, which seemed to affect sentiment regarding bitcoin in Q2.” William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform <a aria-label=Token Metrics class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://tokenmetrics.com/ href=https://tokenmetrics.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://tokenmetrics.com/>Token Metrics</a>, also weighed in on this level, in addition to offering a short-term outlook. “53k was the prior high from back in September,” he stated. “So, that former ceiling might act as a floor near term. 53k will probably act as support for part of the weekend,” added Noble. “Once equities reopen on Monday, selling in bitcoin could pick up again,” he said. “If stocks go down all risky assets including crypto could have another leg down.” Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for <a aria-label=Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://gerberkawasaki.com/ href=https://gerberkawasaki.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://gerberkawasaki.com/>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management</a>, also weighed in. “The assessment of the other analyst sounds accurate, we’d expect Bitcoin to have support around the $50,000-$53,000 level,” he stated. “People are psychologically attracted to placing buy/sell orders at round numbers like $50,000. That same level was a prior resistance point, which is now being tested as new support,” Sifling noted. “We also see support at the $45,000 and $40,000 levels if we fail to hold $50,000-$53,000,” he said. Kiana Danial, CEO of <a aria-label=Invest Diva class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investdiva.com/ href=https://www.investdiva.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investdiva.com/>Invest Diva</a>, also commented, speaking to what could happen if bitcoin works its way through existing support. “BTC/USD has formed a double top bearish reversal chart pattern on the daily chart pattern,” she stated. “Friday’s dip was a test below both the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the lower band of the daily Ichimoku cloud; both being key psychological levels,” said Danial.“The future Ichimoku cloud appears bearish. Confirmation of a break below this level (at around $53K) could indicate further bearish momentum [that] could push the Bitcoin price lower towards the 50% and 61% Fibonacci retracement levels at around $49K and $44K respectively,” she stated. “Keep in mind that such volatilities are normal for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,” said Danial, before offering a bullish outlook. “Once the pullback is completed, there’s a high possibility of Bitcoin bouncing back up and reaching new highs in the new year.” Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency investment manager <a aria-label=LedgerPrime class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.ledgerprime.com/ href=https://www.ledgerprime.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.ledgerprime.com/>LedgerPrime</a>, also offered a bullish take, contending that this latest pullback was a net positive for bitcoin’s future price action. “This dip certainly tracked the fall in equity prices that we’ve seen as a result of Covid fears and concerns about inflation,” he stated. “However, while crypto and equity markets do tend to fluctuate in tandem, they are different markets and crypto in particular is in a strong bull cycle.”“Moreover, the on-chain metrics for Bitcoin – the king crypto to track in a bull run – are still strong: there are more coins getting taken off exchanges than flowing onto them,” said Tang.“This means that once this flushing out finishes, we should see a supply shock in which the price of Bitcoin explodes upwards,” he predicted. “If anything, this dip did more to wash out those cowboy leverage traders and in turn set up healthier conditions for continued price rises in the near future.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Much of those gains came from huge price increases in smaller cryptocurrencies, with ethereum and its rivals Binance's BNB, solana, cardano all far outpacing bitcoin over the last 12 months. The Fed is now beginning to taper its loose economic policy following a sharp rise in inflation and an almost fully-recovered labor market.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices could benefit from slower tapering, several analysts emphasized. Today, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released disappointing <a aria-label=figures class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm href=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm>figures</a> for November jobs growth, a development that could potentially affect the tapering decisions made by Federal Reserve policy makers. The BLS reported that U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 210,000 in November, a figure that fell far short of the 573,000-job increase <a aria-label=predicted class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/jobs-report-november-2021.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/jobs-report-november-2021.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/jobs-report-november-2021.html>predicted</a> by a Dow Jones survey. If these government officials opt to reduce stimulus more slowly because of lackluster economic data, could these actions provide tailwinds for bitcoin prices? [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]They could, according to Ben McMillan, CIO at <a aria-label=IDX Digital Assets class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://idxdigitalassets.com/ href=https://idxdigitalassets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://idxdigitalassets.com/>IDX Digital Assets</a>, who emphasized the key importance of central bank policy. “Especially as bitcoin is coming off a recent rally on the back of broader enthusiasm around adoption (namely the launch of Bitcoin futures ETFs), all eyes are now on the Fed and specifically how aggressive the taper of asset purchases might be,” he said. “Also, bitcoin is increasingly competing for asset flows into Ethereum, DeFi and Metaverse related investments so a less aggressive taper of the stimulus would likely provide a welcome tailwind for the price of bitcoin.” Peter C. Earle, who is an economist at <a aria-label=the American Institute for Economic Research class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.aier.org/ href=https://www.aier.org/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.aier.org/>the American Institute for Economic Research</a> and also writes for <a aria-label=Bitcoin Magazine class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/>Bitcoin Magazine</a>, also weighed in on the situation. “Tapering is the gateway to normalizing interest rates,” he noted. “The Fed can’t begin raising rates (a contractionary policy move), whether to gain policy headspace or to fight inflation, until it ends the purchase of securities in the open market (an expansionary policy measure).”“If the Fed were to decide to postpone the taper in order to provide continued support to a weakening recovery, it would be a great boon for crypto assets,” Earle stated. “In many ways Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become complements to gold, silver, and other traditional inflation hedges rather than a substitute medium of exchange.” “The continuation of quantitative easing would likely exacerbate the already considerable inflationary draft, driving more investors and institutions into the crypto space,” he said.Dylan LeClair, head of market research for <a aria-label=Bitcoin Magazine class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/>Bitcoin Magazine</a>, also offered perspective on the matter. “Markets responded positively across the board following the jobs report this morning, but the rally was very short lived,” he noted. “Equities and Bitcoin quickly resumed their selloffs, and the VIX (S&amp;P 500 Volatility Index) has reached its highest level since January.”“Liquidity across asset classes is being withdrawn as investors brace for a potential Fed taper,” said LeClair. “During liquidity events, correlations across asset classes trend to 1.0, and the recent market movements are what the beginning of a deleveraging event tend to look like.” He also spoke to how global economic conditions could prove beneficial for the world’s most valuable digital currency by market value.“It’s important to remember that with real rates severely negative, every asset on the planet is functionally part of the global ‘everything bubble’ and every investor is looking to protect and grow their purchasing power against central bank monetary debasement as well as the counter-party risk associated with deflationary deleveraging that comes with a financial system engorged with debt,” LeClair noted. “In that sense, Bitcoin is the best asset to own in both outcomes. This is due to absolute scarcity coupled with property rights built into the protocol to eliminate the threat of counter-party risk,” he stated. <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 4 2022 02:10pm ,"Omicron Variant at warning sign in city - new variant of Covid 19The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) report issued Monday night by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for the week ending Nov 23 revealed a three-fold increase in the number of short bitcoin futures contracts held by retail investors compared to the previous week. These holdings, called open interest, represent capital held at the CME as collateral for long and short trades. Shattering the average number of short bitcoin futures held by retail traders (about 798 contracts through last week), the COT report showed a 200% jump in short bitcoin contracts from 887to 2,663. The monetary equivalent of this net short increase is $511 million, and it should be noted it did not come from trading in micro bitcoins (MBT) futures, which is still nascent and 20 times smaller than the BTC futures market. This dramatic shift follows a temporary but equally sharp bullish (long bitcoin) move on the second half of October. Together, these moves suggest that perhaps wealthy retail investors, those able to purchase the typical $300,000 CME bitcoin futures contract, may be starting to place short-term speculative bets in tandem to profit from short-term movements in the volatile cryptocurrency market. In recent weeks and months, the market for providing crypto trading insights has grown from trading platforms like LMAX Digital and Coinbase to also a few US banks with crypto research <a aria-label=teams class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/07/29/bank-of-america-listed-among-heavyweights-invested-in-300-million-blockchain-funding-round/?sh=15bb12e79b7a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/07/29/bank-of-america-listed-among-heavyweights-invested-in-300-million-blockchain-funding-round/?sh=15bb12e79b7a target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/07/29/bank-of-america-listed-among-heavyweights-invested-in-300-million-blockchain-funding-round/?sh=15bb12e79b7a>teams</a>.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commitments of Traders (COT) report; Bitcoin price line. </span>One surprising development seen in the CME bitcoin futures market is the fluidity by which market participants take on and ease off trading risk. While retail traders are uncharacteristically short bitcoin presently, a small (eight to ten) group of asset managers active in CME futures have taken massive, long bitcoin futures positions in November, totaling more than 5,000 bitcoin futures contracts equivalent to $1.5 billion. Thus, the long bitcoin futures holdings of commercial and retail traders seen in October amidst the ProShares BITO bitcoin ETF launch, ushered asset manager demand which they, in turn, received from institutional clients wanting a long bitcoin position in their funds. Long (buy) and short (sell) bitcoin futures held by asset manager firms, according to the Commodity <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commitments of Traders (COT) report</span>Commercial traders, which are firms and/or professionals with deep industry and market knowledge generally hired to mitigate business risk through use of futures contracts, cut back sharply their long bitcoin futures holdings to pre-BITO levels but boosted sharply their ‘spread’ contracts – which is the practice of holding long and short positions in the same contract to provide liquidity to those who need it. Separately and over recent weeks, this group of traders has built a large short position equivalent to $113 million worth of MBT futures contracts which makes them the largest short liquidity providers. Said differently, this group of traders went from facilitating liquidity for the large surge from bitcoin ETF in October to now getting back to a smaller exposure and selectively providing liquidity in new areas like MBTs. Meanwhile retail traders shrewdly adopted the previously discussed short bitcoin futures position, betting on the price of bitcoin possibly falling below the $57,600 level bitcoin seen last week – bitcoin did fall to a low of 53,200 on Nov 28 and that could have provided some of these retail traders a profitable exit of their short trades – which become profitable as the price of an asset decreases in value.   Long (buy) and short (sell) bitcoin futures held by trader group, according to the Commodity Futures <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Trading Commission (CFTC) Commitments of Traders (COT) report</span>The big picture remains bright for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large as institutional demand continues to grow, with large asset managers like Vanguard and BlackRock allowing funds they manage to pour approximately $3 billion each into crypto stocks as of Nov 2021 and rival Fidelity nearly doubling to 200 their institutional clients – hedge funds, family offices, registered investment advisors, pensions and corporate treasuries – that use the firm’s bitcoin execution and custody services. While bitcoin price has dropped 18% below its $69,000 Nov 10 high, this has been due to robust macro headwinds like rising inflation and the Omicron variant impact on the global economy, and not due to weak bitcoin demand. In fact, the sharp drop in crude oil prices - Brent crude oil price down 20%+ since Nov 10 – shows that Omicron uncertainty is providing an organic break to inflationary forces. It will be weeks if not months until the world regains confidence that it can defeat the Omicron variant, and in the meanwhile it’s sensible to expect lower expectations for global economic growth, lower inflation, and a modest appreciation of risky assets like cryptocurrencies. For these reasons, shrewd investors will continue to look to crude oil price action as a proxy for the expected energy demand globally but also as a guide for bitcoin appreciation potential over the short term.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I write about digital assets trends and am a leading creator of the Forbes Digital Assets tools and functionality our viewers require.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin has made several attempts on the $60,000 over the last week. Bitcoin prices have repeatedly approached $60,000 over the last week, climbing above $59,000 both yesterday and today. The world’s most valuable digital currency by market value has made these attempts on the $60,000 level after reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 on November 10 and subsequently falling more than 20% from this zenith, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. The cryptocurrency repeatedly tested the $53,000 level between November 26 and November 28, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. Then, it rose in value, reaching $58,890.73 on November 29, $59,223.38 on November 30 and $59,096.88 today.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] In light of these recent events, several technical analysts weighed in on whether the cryptocurrency has been establishing support near the $60,000 price level. “Bitcoin’s resistance build-up around the $60,000 psychological level is obvious as the premier coin has traded above $59,000 enroute that point about 4 times in the trailing 7-days,” said Greg Waisman, co-founder and COO of the global payment network <a aria-label=Mercuryo class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://mercuryo.io/ href=https://mercuryo.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://mercuryo.io/>Mercuryo</a>.“While this point is a strong resistance to breach, the consolidated action of both retail and institutional investors in catching the expected growth of the digital currency as the year runs to an end is sure to help break the suppression in a bid to make that price level new support,” he stated. “If Bitcoin rides on the path of history, long-term investors have nothing to fear with respect to the seemingly difficult resistance bottleneck that is obvious now,” Waisman added. “Once the $60k point is breached, more retail and institutional investors are likely to FOMO in, helping the impending growth narrative.”Ben McMillan, CIO at <a aria-label=IDX Digital Assets class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://idxdigitalassets.com/ href=https://idxdigitalassets.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://idxdigitalassets.com/>IDX Digital Assets</a>, also weighed in on the matter.“Yes, the $60k level is emerging as an important threshold as that’s where we’ve been seeing profit-taking recently as well as an accumulation of sell-offers on the order books.” Aside from speaking to the key resistance existing near $60,000, McMillan commented on the various factors that could contribute to bitcoin prices breaking through that level. “Our sentiment models are neutral and, on the macro side, the recent strength of the USD is also likely providing a bit of a dampener on upside expectations for bitcoin,” he stated. “Market expectations around the Fed's pace of the taper will be important in pushing bitcoin past the $60k level.” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a aria-label=BitBull Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ href=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/>BitBull Capital</a>, also provided some input on the situation. “Key price milestones like $50,000 and $60,000 are major support and resistance levels,” he noted. “Moreover, $60,000 is an area with high market interest due to all-time-highs being made in that range.” “For Bitcoin to remain bullish in this cycle it needs to cross $60,000 and stay above it,” DiPasquale emphasized. “In the event that happens, we are likely to see a major altcoin rally materialize.”<em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Dec 1 2021 12:24pm ,"Securities and Exchange Commission, Chairman Gary Gensler (Bill Clark/Pool via AP)On November 12, 2021 the SEC <a aria-label=rejected class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2021/34-93559.pdf href=https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2021/34-93559.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2021/34-93559.pdf>rejected</a> a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by Van Eck Associates Corporation (“VanEck”) that would have directly tracked bitcoin’s spot price movements.On March 1, 2021, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, a proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the VanEck Bitcoin Trust under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on March 19, 2021. If approved, it would have become the first spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S.However, the proposed rule change was rejected by the SEC earlier this month, an unsurprising outcome even in light of the regulator greenlighting three futures-based ETFs, including one from Van Eck. In the rejection, the SEC said Cboe had not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular, the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” and “to protect investors and the public interest.” This justification has been repeatedly used by the regulator in past rejections, but in light of futures ETFs being allowed to trade, it now seemed contradictory to many.An ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the performance of a particular asset or group of assets. ETFs allow investors to efficiently diversify their portfolios without directly owning the assets. This feature is especially relevant to cryptocurrency, where many more conservative investors worry about the risks and challenges that come with buying and holding assets such as bitcoin themselves. The first rule filing proposing to list an exchange-traded product tracking bitcoin in the U.S. was submitted by the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, operated by brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, on June 30, 2016. This proposal was rejected by the Commission. The SEC’s reason for rejecting the Winklevoss ETF and more subsequent applications has been rooted in the Commission's concerns over fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market. The SEC states on their website that the Commision “strives to promote a market environment that is worthy of the public’s trust and characterized by transparency and integrity” and its mission “is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.” But should the SEC be restrictive of a free market and is their way of regulating really protecting consumers? In an interview at a CryptoConnect Event in Miami two weeks ago, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce described a different role of the SEC, saying  “[f]rom my perspective, the SEC’s role is a disclosure role. To help people get the information they need to make decisions for themselves.”There are many other spot ETF applications still in front of the SEC, and they risk receiving the same fate unless the SEC’s concerns are mollified or some other legal argument can prevail.There are some key differences between how futures and spot-based ETFs operate that are worth keeping in mind. First, while the bitcoin futures products needed final approval from the SEC, a lot of the leg work was done by one of its sister agencies, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has a different remit than the SEC. Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo told me, “The SEC oversees people's retirements, and pensions, investments that go into retail investors’ savings. This is different from the CFTC’s focus on orderly and well-functioning markets, as the marketplaces overseen by the CFTC are primarily institutional, with not a lot of retail participation.” As a result, when it came to the launch of bitcoin futures, it was a matter of the exchanges certifying to the CFTC that in their judgment, bitcoin futures, as opposed to the underlying market, were not readily susceptible to manipulation. There was no requirement that there be a certification that the underlying spot markets were free of fraud and manipulation.”This doesn’t mean the CFTC has not scrutinized the cryptocurrency space, or stepped in when necessary. For instance, in September 2021, the CFTC announced 14 complaints against various crypto trading platforms. But the exchanges themselves have much more authority to approve new products than SEC-regulated counterparts. Still, when the SEC finally approved the first futures-based bitcoin ETFs in early October 2021, including ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF, it likely did so relying on the CFTC’s satisfaction that the methodologies used by the CME were satisfactory to minimize the ability to readily manipulate the futures markets. It is also worth noting that Gary Gensler was formerly Chairman of the CFTC.Spot applicants are now stepping up the pressure on the SEC. On October 19, 2021, before the VanEck rejection, Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, <a aria-label=filed class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/19/2316640/0/en/NYSE-Arca-Files-Form-19b-4-to-Convert-Grayscale-Bitcoin-Trust-into-an-ETF.html href=https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/19/2316640/0/en/NYSE-Arca-Files-Form-19b-4-to-Convert-Grayscale-Bitcoin-Trust-into-an-ETF.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/19/2316640/0/en/NYSE-Arca-Files-Form-19b-4-to-Convert-Grayscale-Bitcoin-Trust-into-an-ETF.html>filed </a>with the SEC to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a bitcoin spot ETF. Yesterday attorneys at Davis Polk also sent a <a aria-label=letter class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-9410842-262990.pdf href=https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-9410842-262990.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-9410842-262990.pdf>letter </a>to the SEC arguing that approval of Bitcoin futures-based ETFs, but not Bitcoin spot-based ETFs like GBTC is “arbitrary and capricious” and therefore in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA requires the SEC to treat like situations alike absent a reasonable basis for different treatment. This means the SEC must treat similarly situated investment products similarly. This is a new argument in the context of Bitcoin ETFs that wasn’t possible until the SEC approved the latest futures-based ETF but then rejected yet another spot-based ETF (VanEck).But here is where things get confusing. The CME relies on reference rates provided by regulated spot exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken to price the futures contracts on which the futures ETFs are based. It is a very sophisticated process that adds to the reliability and resiliency of the data. During my discussion with Giancarlo, he explained, “These futures exchanges don't just take the closing price from spot trading platforms. In fact, they don't take the closing price at all. They take price data at different six minute intervals during the trading day, somewhere around 10 different times per day and then they create an aggregate reference price which really minimizes the possibility that Bitcoin futures are readily susceptible to manipulation. As a result, the CFTC felt comfortable with the exchanges’ self-certifications.”That said, the spot market on the other hand is more decentralized and includes the same regulated exchanges but also may include less regulated exchanges in the pricing methodology. It has seen major liquidation events. This may be where the SEC sees the distinction between the two products. Additionally, some of the SEC’s concerns on price manipulation may stem from reports that Bitfinex used the “stablecoin” Tether to allegedly drive up the price of cryptocurrency in 2017 and 2018. A study conducted by John M. Griffin from the University of Texas at Austin - Department of Finance and Amin Shams from Ohio State University, Fisher College of Business reviewed the period between March 2017 and March 2018, when the price of bitcoin soared and its total market value rose to $326 billion. They claim about half of that increase was due to the influence of a manipulation scheme. Gary Gensler has said that some stablecoins, which may invest in corporate bonds and other assets, look similar to money-market mutual funds and should fall under SEC purview. The Treasury Department and other agencies recently specified that the SEC has significant authority over stablecoins like Tether.In February, Tether settled with the New York Attorney General over allegations that it lied about the reserves backing the coin. The CFTC earlier this month ordered Tether to pay $41 million over similar claims. The SEC is reportedly also investigating various other stablecoin projects.There may also be political reasons at play. In July of this year, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a long time skeptic of cryptocurrency, asked the SEC to take a closer look at cryptocurrency exchanges. In a July 7, 2021 <a aria-label=letter class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Draft%20SEC%20Crypto%20Exchange%20Letter%2007.7.2021%20clean.pdf href=https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Draft%20SEC%20Crypto%20Exchange%20Letter%2007.7.2021%20clean.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Draft%20SEC%20Crypto%20Exchange%20Letter%2007.7.2021%20clean.pdf>letter</a>, Warren asked SEC Chairman <a aria-label=Gary Gensler class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://thehill.com/people/gary-gensler href=https://thehill.com/people/gary-gensler rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://thehill.com/people/gary-gensler>Gary Gensler</a> to explain if cryptocurrency exchanges operate in a safe and efficient manner, and what regulatory action might be necessary to protect investors.“While demand for cryptocurrencies and the use of cryptocurrency exchanges have skyrocketed, the lack of common-sense regulations has left ordinary investors at the mercy of manipulators and fraudsters...These regulatory gaps endanger consumers and investors and undermine the safety of our financial markets. The SEC must use its full authority to address these risks, and Congress must also step up to close these regulatory gaps and ensure that every investor has access to a safe cryptocurrency marketplace.”Another reason for frustration is the fact that many international spot cryptocurrency ETFs, including many digital assets beyond bitcoin, have been operating without incident for months or years. Earlier this year, Canadian regulators approved ETFs that hold bitcoin directly. The first one launched in February from Purpose Investments on the Toronto Stock Exchange, trading under the ticker symbol BTCC.B, which currently has 1.714B assets under management.Gurbacs noted to me, “The vast majority of established jurisdictions in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other nations approved physical Bitcoin ETFs and tens of millions of Americans own cryptocurrencies on trading platforms.” Dave Abner, Global Head of Business Development at Gemini expressed similar frustration, “ As evidenced by similar funds in other jurisdictions, the model provides investors with a wrapped solution for bitcoin that works like other traditional investment products and provides returns that are completely in sync with the underlying assets. Physical ETFs have already proven to do a great job at removing performance issues with other types of products like CEFs and Futures based funds.”However, there are differences between the US and other countries that may explain the US’s delay. For instance the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), in approving or disapproving an ETF, the burden is on the OSC to explain why it would not be in the public interest to approve a product like a bitcoin ETF, not on the applicant. Whereas in the US, the burden is on the issuer to prove why the regulator should approve or disapprove the application.Despite these ongoing challenges many are still optimistic that a spot bitcoin ETF approval will come mid to late 2022. Projects are continuing to have discussions with the SEC about best practices to prevent any market manipulation or fraud. Craig Salm, Head of Legal at Grayscale, shared similar sentiment and explained, “During our engagements, the SEC has asked questions pertaining to Grayscale becoming a spot bitcoin ETF. The Commission is asking things like how does the index methodology work? What types of exchanges are included in there? What discretion does the index provider have? How has Grayscale’s pricing worked over the last couple of years? And these are all questions that they can only ask us because we have an actual operating investment vehicle. From those conversations, I have seen them in real time becoming more familiarized and comfortable with the spot-based products.”A Bitcoin ETF approval will open the door for more conservative investors, and this will have a positive impact on the industry as a whole and the price of bitcoin.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I currently provide&amp;nbsp;legal consulting to cryptocurrency and fintech companies.

Dec 1 2021 09:00am ,"Brian Armstrong, founder of Coinbase, photographed for Forbes by Jamel Toppin in January 2020.There was a time when Amazon Web Services (AWS) was just an afterthought for the Seattle-based company, overshadowed by Amazon’s gargantuan e-commerce business. Fast forward to today, and the Amazon subsidiary, which launched almost 20 years ago, is now the $1.8 trillion company’s main profit engine. In 2020, AWS delivered $13.5 billion in annual operating profits, good for 63% of the parent company’s total, on a revenue base of $45.3 billion.U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase is hoping to follow in these footsteps with its own infrastructure product, Coinbase Cloud. “We want to be the AWS of crypto,” said Coinbase chief product officer Surojit Chatterjee in an exclusive interview with <em>Forbes</em>. “We are building this whole Coinbase Cloud suite of products that you can think of as crypto computing services, to help developers build their applications faster.”Coinbase executives will be the first to tell you that it needs to get here sooner rather than later. For all of the accolades received by Coinbase for not only being the first major crypto firm to go public, but also for doing so via the largest direct listing in history, its revenue base is overly reliant on transaction fees (+90%). When the company went public, the figure was around 97%. This level of revenue concentration in a single line-item is typically reserved for major technology platforms such as Facebook or Google, which almost solely rely on advertising to drive profits.But for the crypto giant, or any other exchange, such dependence can be a major vulnerability because trading volumes are highly correlated with market volatility. When the crypto market hit a lull in the third quarter this year, Coinbase’s trading volume and revenue fell 29% and 39% respectively. The company still turned in a profit of $406 million, but that was an almost  75% drop from its second quarter result of $1.6 billion.It has also impacted investors, many of which bought shares in Coinbase with the expectation that the stock would offer more diversified exposure to crypto than just buying bitcoin. The reality has proved different, as Coinbase’s price has closely tracked bitcoin since it went public in April.Coinbase and Bitcoin have been in lockstep this yearTo mitigate this liability, smooth out revenues, and protect itself from fee compressions that have impacted traditional brokers such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, Coinbase is looking to supplement trading revenues with subscription services that will be more immune to market swings. For instance, it offers an institutional custody service, staking opportunities, a learning portal that rewards users with crypto, e-commerce checkout program, and issues Visa debit cards to customers. It is also trialing a subscription service that will provide a monthly trading allowance for a set fee.As a result of this evolution and product development, subscription and services revenue grew 41% sequentially to $145 million in Q3, accounting for 11.7% of total revenue. But according to Coinbase executives, they are just getting started. This is where Bison Trails comes in.Lost amidst all of the market euphoria earlier this year was Coinbase’s January acquisition of the Brooklyn, NY-based market infrastructure provider for an undisclosed sum (the company would not share any financials on the terms of the deal when asked recently). After the deal was consummated, Bison Trails co-founders Joe Lallouz and Aaron Henshaw became the new heads of Coinbase Cloud.For Chatterjee, bringing on Bison Trails was a key part of Coinbase’s transition to supporting a more mature financial ecosystem. “Crypto is not just just buying and selling tokens, it's building this whole financial system on top of blockchain. We think we can play a big part in leading our customers to the utility phase of crypto from this first phase, which is more investment or speculation driven...our goal is to be the primary financial account of the crypto economy for our customers.” Today the platform supports crypto custodians, funds, decentralized applications, and token holders. Some of its key clients include prominent venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), New York-based fintech firm Current, and Turner Sports.In a forthcoming press release, Trevor Marshall, CTO of Current, says “the secure, reliable infrastructure and network expertise Bison Trails (Coinbase Cloud) provides has been invaluable to making it possible for Current to be an early, active participant in Polkadot, Karura and Acala and build hybrid financial products that have the potential to improve the financial outcomes of even more people.”Still, achieving long-term growth will require significant backend engineering and technical support. After all, becoming the AWS of crypto demands much more than just cloud storage. There must be enhancements such as stable and low-latency connectivity to networks and blockchains as well as various crypto computing services. All of this is to help developers build applications faster within the ever-growing Coinbase ecosystem to serve its client base. It also requires extensive protocol knowledge. “In order to run 30 blockchains, you need highly resilient, reliable, secure infrastructure. These things are powering this new financial platform,” says Henshaw. “But you also need deep protocol expertise. One of the things we pride ourselves on and I think that our customers really like is that we're experts in the protocols we support.”Although the company does not specifically break out Coinbase Cloud revenues or employee counts in its financial statements, it did provide the following metrics to demonstrate market traction.That said, as asset prices have skyrocketed this year and use cases continue to grow from decentralized finance applications and NFTs to now the metaverse, competition is fierce. Billions of dollars in grants, venture funds, and incentive programs have been issued to entice developers to work directly on certain blockchains such as Celo, Avalanche, Algorand, Cardano, and Solana. Additionally, specialized companies, such as Alchemy, have garnered billion dollar valuations by providing the same type of backend infrastructure that is being developed by Bison Trails for Coinbase—to help developers directly build on top of blockchains. In fact, in late October Alchemy raised a $250 million Series C round of funding at a $3.5 billion valuation. In issued comments surrounding the funding round, a16z General Partner Ali Yahya <a aria-label=drew direct parallels between Alchemy’s offering and AWS class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/aws-for-blockchain-alchemy-boost-valuation-to-3-5b-with-250m-raise/ href=https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/aws-for-blockchain-alchemy-boost-valuation-to-3-5b-with-250m-raise/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/aws-for-blockchain-alchemy-boost-valuation-to-3-5b-with-250m-raise/>drew direct parallels between Alchemy’s offering and AWS</a> (a16z was also an early investor in Coinbase). Although Alchemy is tight-lipped about its metrics, it has staked out a leadership position in supporting dapps. For instance, some of its major clients include the world’s largest NFT marketplace OpenSea and the massively popular multiplayer online game Axie Infinity. In fact, it currently supports virtually the entire NFT industry and claims to have 70% of the top apps as customers (regardless of crypto use case). It also claims to handle $45 billion in transactions on an annualized basis. That said, Coinbase is not overly concerned about Alchemy’s head start or market share, because it has something that virtually no other crypto firm has today, a verified user base of 73 million customers looking to go deeper into crypto. The community saw the power of this in-house customer base first-hand last month when the company released a wait-list for its forthcoming NFT project. Over 1 million people signed up on the first day. Henshaw expects that this direct access to clients, plus Coinbase’s reputation for simple and intuitive platforms and user experiences, if not customer service, will be a key advantage moving forward.Calling it a 1+1 = 3 scenario, he compares the full suite of Coinbase’s offerings to “Just read/write infrastructure, which is what Alchemy does...All of the other products and services that Coinbase uniquely can bring to developers such as trading, fiat on-ramps, we offer a single place for people to build the full end to end experience that really doesn't exist today.” <p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am director of research for digital assets at Forbes.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Multiple journalists declared that bitcoin had entered a bear market after a recent decline.Recently, bitcoin suffered a sell-off, which resulted in the digital currency’s price declining more than 20% from the all-time high it set earlier this month. Following this drop, technology reporter Ryan Browne <a aria-label=published a CNBC article class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/crypto-bitcoin-btc-enters-bear-market-on-new-covid-variant.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/crypto-bitcoin-btc-enters-bear-market-on-new-covid-variant.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/crypto-bitcoin-btc-enters-bear-market-on-new-covid-variant.html>published a CNBC article</a> stating that the cryptocurrency had entered a bear market. “Bear markets are typically defined by a decline of 20% or more from recent highs,” his article stated. Browne wasn’t alone, as Kate Rooney, another technology reporter at CNBC, <a aria-label=declared class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMGMumIsoyo href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMGMumIsoyo rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMGMumIsoyo>declared</a> the same day that bitcoin’s 20% drop from its all-time high had “officially” put the cryptocurrency in “bear market territory.” [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] It would seem that these journalists were relying on a more <a aria-label=traditional definition class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp>traditional definition</a> of a bear market, meaning a decline of at least 20% from a recent high. However, this definition doesn’t work for bitcoin, according to several market experts who offered input for this article.“Traditional definitions of bull and bear markets are inconsistent with crypto price action,” said Amber Ghaddar, cofounder of decentralized capital marketplace <a aria-label=AllianceBlock class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.allianceblock.io/#team href=https://www.allianceblock.io/#team rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.allianceblock.io/#team>AllianceBlock</a>. “In crypto markets, 20% plus dips occur frequently and are often part of a correction followed by a broader build-up. Throughout 2016 and 2017 we had six corrections of 30%+,” she noted. Sylvia Jablonski, cofounder and chief investment officer for ETF sponsor <a aria-label=Defiance ETFs class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.defianceetfs.com/ href=https://www.defianceetfs.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.defianceetfs.com/>Defiance ETFs</a>, offered a similar take. “Bitcoin fell 20% off of its all-time high, which in the equities world, correlates to a bear market. This, however, doesn’t really apply to bitcoin,” she stated.“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (all 14,000 plus of them!) are volatile asset classes that are very reactive to things like covid, green concerns, regulation, taxes, mining, high inflation, no inflation, 10 year, technology, adoption, etc.,” said Jablonski. Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider <a aria-label=Trade The Chain class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.tradethechain.com/ href=https://www.tradethechain.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.tradethechain.com/>Trade The Chain</a>, also commented on the situation. “Saying Bitcoin is in a bear market the second it decreases 20 percent is incorrect,” he stated.“Bitcoin is inherently volatile due to its finite supply (available supply is much lower than total supply), lack of centralized authority, and its 24/7 international trading hours. These are new concepts that are not replicated across the traditional finance sector,” he noted. The market observer also spoke to the mindset of investors. “Bitcoin daily sentiment is now back to levels we saw before the Omicron news broke, according to our own data and price is already back near $59,000 again.” “If it was a Bitcoin bear market, I’d say it was the shortest one in history.” The chart below depicts the change in the sentiment of market observers, tracked on a daily and hourly basis: Sentiment data measured on an hourly and daily basis <strong>Defining A Bitcoin Bear Market</strong>When it came to determining what, exactly, constitutes a bear market in bitcoin, market analysts were unable to provide a consensus. “There is no rule of thumb, as this asset class is too young and historical data is too sparse,” said Ghaddar. “Looking at Bitcoin, we can expect to enter a bear market when the price change is greater than 20% and prices do not return within three months to the previous high.”Mancini also offered his take on the matter. “Bitcoin’s volatility creates difficulty in applying traditional ways of measuring the long term trend,” he emphasized. “Bitcoin is an asset that has, multiple times, fallen more than 70 percent from an all time high and has, each time, eventually risen to beat all time highs.” Jesse Proudman, cofounder and CEO of crypto robo-advisor <a aria-label=Makara class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://makara.com/ href=https://makara.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://makara.com/>Makara</a>, summed the situation up nicely: “A crypto bear market is like the offsides rule in soccer - it’s hard to define, but you know it when you see it,” he stated. “We don’t believe we are in a bear market right now, and our outlook remains bullish through at least the end of the year.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

</fbs-ticker> down. It would slow crypto down, if we have to start raising rates much faster than we thought.After slashing interest rates and launching huge stimulus programs at the beginning of the pandemic, central bankers around the world are under increasing pressure to act in the face of surging inflation. In recent weeks, the Fed has trimmed its bond purchases, with minutes from its last monetary policy meeting revealing officials are considering further scaling back its quantitative easing measures.Novogratz also warned people are getting pretty bearish on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies after the huge rallies over the last year, with the price of bitcoin up almost 200%, the ethereum price up 600% and the likes of ethereum rivals solana, Binance's BNB and cardano up many thousands of percent. Meanwhile, other bitcoin and crypto market watchers have echoed Novogratz's concerns. [Last week we had] further evidence that bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset than an inflation hedge coming in the form of a sharp spike when the news broke that Biden had decided to renominate Jerome Powell—gold, in contrast, dropped, Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at digital prime broker Genesis, said in emailed comments. This links bitcoin to the outlook for real interest rates which, should they remain low or even negative for the short-term, would support further growth in risk assets. The risk is that real interest rates could rise to a level that starts to choke off growth and liquidity while hitting asset valuations in the broader market while providing a more attractive alternative.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has rocketed almost 200% since this time last year but has been left in the dust <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

The news of a new Covid variant coming out of South Africa led to a broad-based sell-off across asset classes, Martha Reyes, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant, said in emailed comments. If lockdowns do ensue, which is not our base case scenario, that will lead to further helicopter money, which ultimately benefits digital assets.The crypto sell-off this week, which saw the bitcoin price fall in line with traditional markets, surprised some in the crypto industry who are used to crypto prices moving independently of stocks and traditional assets. The cryptocurrency market, for the most part, doesn’t correlate with the traditional markets, Tally Greenberg, head of business development at blockchain company Allnodes, said in emailed comments. However, there come times when even cryptocurrency follows world events. The news of a new Covid-19 variant has shaken the world with yet another uncertainty about our global road to recovery, which caused a major dip for large and small cryptocurrencies and plummeting stocks and bonds across all nations.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Meanwhile, ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, dropped towards the closely-watched $4,000 per ether level. The broad bitcoin and crypto sell-off—also hitting Binance's BNB, solana, cardano, Ripple's XRP and dogecoin—has wiped around $200 billion from the combined crypto market capitalization since Monday. <a aria-label=Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>Sign up now for the free <em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A daily newsletter for the crypto-curious.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> post-Thanksgiving discount shopping event Black Friday kicks off around the world. Ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, cardano, XRP and dogecoin also plummeted. </span>With increased equity market volatility, crypto investors should be on guard, Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, said in emailed comments. He warned the bitcoin price is vulnerable to broad market movements partly due to recent institutional investment that can have a knock-on effect on smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, cardano, Ripple's XRP and dogecoinBecause of the institutional love affair, bitcoin is substantially vulnerable to moments of exit from risky assets when it sells off everything, regardless of the outlook. And its severe sell-off risks dragging the entire cryptocurrency market down with it.However, Kuptsikevich also thinks bitcoin has begun acting as something of a so-called safe-haven asset, with retail investors buying bitcoin in times of increased uncertainty. From a different perspective, retail investors have developed a reflex to buy crypto on coronavirus fears, with the WHO discussing new virus variants and restrictions on air travel, he added. Other bitcoin and crypto investors are confident the latest crash is only a temporary blip, exacerbated by Black Friday and the Thanksgiving Day holiday.The crypto market has been hit by a temporary sell-off that mirrors that of the global stock market amid concerns about a new Covid-19 variant that’s been discovered in southern Africa, crypto investor and deVere Group chief executive Nigel Green said in emailed comments. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price fell to under $55,000 per bitcoin, dragging down the price of ethereum, Binance's <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> BNB, solana, cardano, XRP and dogecoin. </span>Triggered by a mini-wave of uncertainty, the parallel moves of the crypto market and the stock markets highlight that digital assets are now mainstream. The headlines have prompted a knee-jerk reaction, made more pronounced because much of the market was celebrating Thanksgiving and not participating.Before the latest sell-off, bitcoin had seen a wave of interest from investors looking to shield themselves from run-away inflation that has spiked around the world in recent months. This [bitcoin price crash] will be short-lived, with crypto markets likely to rebound in the near-term as investors once again focus on the heightening global inflation fears, added Green. Meanwhile, it was noted the bitcoin price drop came amid a fall in the bitcoin hash rate—a measure of the computing power directed at the bitcoin network. Both the hash rate chart and price chart have fallen in tandem this morning in a way that would suggest it is not a coincidence, Jason Deane, an analyst with bitcoin and crypto research outfit Quantum Economics, said via Twitter DM after <a aria-label=spotting class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/JasonADeane/status/1464149806926991362 href=https://twitter.com/JasonADeane/status/1464149806926991362 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/JasonADeane/status/1464149806926991362>spotting</a> the hash rate drop. While there are other factors in play, my initial view is that this is a market overreaction to something that seems to be an issue, but isn't in real terms—such is the strength of a decentralized system. However, in the short term, traders can expect a bumpy ride as the market makes its own assessment.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

The danger is high that it will become a tulip inflation, added Scholz, referring to the famous speculative tulip bubble that began in 17th century Amsterdam.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Analysts weigh in on a crucial support level for bitcoin. Since reaching a fresh, all-time high of nearly $69,000 earlier this month, bitcoin prices have experienced multiple sell-offs, repeatedly pushing lower. The world’s most prominent digital currency reached its latest zenith on November 10, before approaching $62,000 two days later, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> reveals. After that retracement, bitcoin mounted a recovery, climbing above $66,300 on November 15, additional CoinDesk figures show. Following this upward movement, the digital asset fell back once again, dropping below $56,000 on November 18, before rising above $60,000 on November 21. Since that time, bitcoin prices have repeatedly approached $55,000, reaching a <a aria-label=six-week low class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2021/11/23/bitcoin-prices-fall-to-their-lowest-in-almost-6-weeks/?sh=113b7cc02aa5 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2021/11/23/bitcoin-prices-fall-to-their-lowest-in-almost-6-weeks/?sh=113b7cc02aa5 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2021/11/23/bitcoin-prices-fall-to-their-lowest-in-almost-6-weeks/?sh=113b7cc02aa5>six-week low</a> yesterday. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Following these continued declines, several market experts weighed in on a key support level that might interest technical traders. “The cost basis of short-term BTC investors has historically served as a bull market support band,” noted Alyse Killeen, founder and managing partner of venture capital firm <a aria-label=Stillmark class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.stillmark.com/ href=https://www.stillmark.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.stillmark.com/>Stillmark</a>. “Blockware Market Intelligence reports that this metric, on-chain VWAP (volume-weighted average price), is currently around $53K,” she stated recently. “Approximately $53K is also the BTC price at a 1 trillion-dollar bitcoin market cap, which may have psychological significance for investors and traders,” Killeen added. Pankaj Balani, cofounder &amp; CEO of <a aria-label=Delta Exchange class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.delta.exchange/ href=https://www.delta.exchange/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.delta.exchange/>Delta Exchange</a>, responded to these claims. “Yes. I agree with this assessment. 1 Tn MCAP as a strong support is also something that I highlighted in my previous note,” he stated. “We feel that the market will stay rangebound in the short term. BTC has failed above 60K a few times and it will take some doing to break above that level, at the same time 53-54K, which is also 1TN market cap, will act as a strong support,” Balani predicted.Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst of <a aria-label=TrendSpider class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://trendspider.com/ href=https://trendspider.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://trendspider.com/>TrendSpider</a>, offered a slightly different take. “I agree that anytime the dollar cost average price is tested, it can be an area for the price to bounce simply because the average participant is back to breakeven, drying up supply on the market,” he stated. However, Wujastyk was more skeptical about the claim that the $1 trillion market cap provides notable support. “I do not think the market cap of Bitcoin provides any psychological significance for investors and traders as price levels are what is generally thought of as psychological levels important to market participants rather than the market cap.” Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of the global payment network <a aria-label=Mercuryo class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://mercuryo.io/ href=https://mercuryo.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://mercuryo.io/>Mercuryo</a>, also offered his perspective on the matter. “Despite the sustained sell-offs that we have seen in the price of Bitcoin, the premier digital currency has not traded below the 30-day low of $55,632, showcasing the legitimacy of the VWAP metric which places the Bitcoin price support around $53,000,” he noted. “Thus far, buyers have been able to cushion the market from the selling pressure, and this has largely shown how mature the market has grown in the past year.” Further, Kozyakov provided a bullish outlook. “Short-term holders should be seen as vital to help maintain a healthy market, and as long as the premier coin continues to hold the forte above the psychological mark at $53,000, the imminent runup to the previous ATH at $68,789 will be just a matter of time.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices declined today, falling to their lowest since mid-October. (Photo Illustration by <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Chesnot/Getty Images)</span>Bitcoin prices suffered some weakness today, dropping to their lowest since mid-October, as market observers cited several factors as potentially triggering these declines. The world’s most prominent digital currency depreciated to $55,460.96 today, according to <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a>. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading at its lowest since October 13, additional CoinDesk figures show. In addition, it was down close to 20% from the all-time high of nearly $69,000 it reached earlier this month. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]<strong>Multiple Bearish Factors</strong>When explaining the digital currency’s latest downward movement, analysts pointed to numerous variables as possibly fueling these losses. “I don’t think there’s any single catalyst that’s pushing Bitcoin prices lower this week,” said John Iadeluca, founder &amp; CEO of multi-strategy fund <a aria-label=Banz Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.banz.capital/ href=https://www.banz.capital/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.banz.capital/>Banz Capital</a>. “There’s been movement of Bitcoin from extremely old wallets that has spurred rumors. In my opinion though, Bitcoin’s price decline this week is a culmination of rising selling pressure, end of year profit-taking, as well as speculation,” he stated. When asked to elaborate on what he meant by “speculation,” Iadeluca emphasized that many market observers are trying to figure out “what the movement of Bitcoin from the old wallets means, and whether this indicates large sales of Bitcoin made from these wallets in the near future.”<strong>Mt. Gox Concerns</strong>Multiple analysts spoke to the impact that the ongoing Mt. Gox situation could have had on the price of bitcoin.Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of Mt. Gox, <a aria-label=announced recently class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20211116_announcement_en.pdf href=https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20211116_announcement_en.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20211116_announcement_en.pdf>announced recently</a> that the proposed rehabilitation plan for the exchange, which was <a aria-label=hacked class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/12/2-billion-lost-in-mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-can-be-recovered-lawyer-claims/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/12/2-billion-lost-in-mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-can-be-recovered-lawyer-claims/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/12/2-billion-lost-in-mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-can-be-recovered-lawyer-claims/>hacked</a> back in 2014, was “final and binding.” As a result, creditors of the now-defunct exchange will receive more than 140,000 units of bitcoin, which is worth more than $7 billion, according to CoinDesk price data. If these creditors sell their holdings, it would place downward pressure on the price of bitcoin, potentially fueling significant declines. Andrew Rossow, an internet and technology attorney, claimed that these developments are already affecting the digital currency. “I am very confident that due to the Rehabilitation Trustee beginning to make (re) payments to creditors, this is driving up the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index, causing market sentiment to go down with respect to Bitcoin's market price,” he stated.“What this demonstrates is while the details of Mt. Gox's rehabilitation plan have been generally known to the public and investors for some time, consumer and investor behavior shows fear to still be the driving factor for Bitcoin’s price,” Rossow added. “Fear is what pushes it lower, but also fear pushes it higher - I believe the fear from Mt. Gox is what dropped the price,” he stated. Iadeluca also claimed that the Mt. Gox situation has been looming over investors. “Yes, I think the Mt. Gox situation has played a hand in adding downward pressure on Bitcoin prices recently,” he stated. “Regardless of whether the situation proves to be catastrophic or not, it seems to be provoking market FUD.” Dylan LeClair, head of market research for <a aria-label=Bitcoin Magazine class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/>Bitcoin Magazine</a>, offered a more skeptical take on the matter. “The headlines recently from the Mt.Gox trustee’s dispute may have had some market impact due to headline traders marginally,” he stated. “Some of the creditors have said they do not expect to get their claims resolved until 2023, as well as some of the claims have been already acquired by hedge funds,” LeClair added. “Mt.Gox news is more headline grabbing than market moving in our opinion.” <strong>Dollar Strength</strong>LeClair claimed that the rising value of the U.S. dollar, relative to other fiat currencies, has contributed to the recent losses in bitcoin prices. “When viewing what is occurring in legacy markets with the DXY, which measures the value of a dollar relative to other fiat currencies, there has been a continued strengthening throughout 2021, and this is a potential catalyst for a risk off move across all global markets,” he stated. Dollar strength “has played a part, at least marginally,” in causing risk-off selling, which has in turn helped push bitcoin prices lower, the analyst said. “$BTC is BTC/USD, and when the denominator is strengthening relative to other foreign currencies, investors have to sell dollar denominated assets to cover denominated dollar denominated liabilities,” LeClair noted. Rossow also commented on this matter. “The DXY price index certainly has an impact on Bitcoin's price. The difficulty here, however, is identifying the exact factors that drive growth and decline, making it challenging for a clear relationship to be identified as between DXY and Bitcoin's price.”“If we are going off past behavior, there seems to be a negative correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the DXY - meaning, as the U.S. dollar rises in price, Bitcoin's price will very likely crash due to it possibly not being equally represented in traditional portfolios.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

The cryptocurrency is still up 97% year-to-date and its volatility is often billed as a positive trait, as it removes leverage from the market by liquidating high-risk traders.Even so, the recent blow-off-top has surprised those who felt certain that bitcoin will attain a six-digit price by the end of 2021.The cryptocurrency's previous two market cycle tops occurred at four-year intervals in the run-up to Christmas, with price reaching $1,163 on November 30, 2013 and $19,666 on December 17, 2017.Both peaks were followed by drawn-out 84-87% downturns – popularly dubbed 'crypto winters' – so the stakes couldn’t be higher for anyone looking to cash out in the final stage of the current bull-run. (It’s worth noting that opinions differ, with some traders arguing that four-year market cycles will be replaced by an era of sustained growth: the “this time is different” perspective).No-one knows what will happen. But by looking at recent price action we can at least identify an area of technical support which will likely need to hold if bitcoin is to achieve its long-awaited parabolic pump.WEEKLY CHART: since September, the 20-week simple moving average (blue line) has overlapped <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> perfectly with a parabolic curve that can be drawn by connecting all of bitcoin's higher-timeframe lows over the past two years (red line).</span>The above weekly chart highlights the significance of the $50-55,000 range for two simple reasons.First, the up-trend that began in July has established the 20-week simple moving average (blue line) as a pullback zone around which price could be expected to make a new higher low before resuming its upward trajectory. That first happened in September, when price dipped just below the weekly 20SMA before pumping from around $40,000 to this month's all time high.The expectation – should the up-trend remain intact – would be for a similar move towards the 20SMA to trigger bitcoin’s next leg up. It currently sits at about $50,800.Second, when you join together the market lows of March 2020 (around $4,000), September 2020 (around $10,000), June 2021 (around $29,000) and September 2021 (around $40,000), you automatically draw a curved line with exponential growth (red line) that attains verticality around April 2022. Or, put another way, that runs its course during the first quarter of next year.Note that the weekly 20SMA has perfectly mirrored this curve since September. It also currently sits at about $50,800 .Few assets are as confounding as bitcoin, so any technical analysis must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, even the most bullish of traders will admit that a dip below $50,000 would not bode well for bitcoin’s chances of a parabolic end to this market cycle.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am an aviation journalist turned crypto reporter whose work has appeared in The Guardian, The Economist, The New York Times, Flightglobal, African Business, Al Arabiya &amp;amp; New Eastern Europe.

Nov 23 2021 07:00am,"Computer, Bank, Blockchain, Coin, CurrencyAre all bitcoins created equal? Not necessarily according to Galaxy Digital. Revealed exclusively to <em>Forbes</em>, today the company is releasing a report, <a aria-label=How Much Does It Cost To Mine A Bitcoin? class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://docsend.com/view/nk6szu7i8e6tv45m href=https://docsend.com/view/nk6szu7i8e6tv45m rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://docsend.com/view/nk6szu7i8e6tv45m><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://docsend.com/view/nk6szu7i8e6tv45m>How Much Does It Cost To Mine A Bitcoin?</em></a><em>, </em>from its research team.The answer to this question matters greatly. First, as the price of bitcoin grows along with interest in the space, many people are starting to worry about the growing carbon footprint of the industry. Although the precise figure is disputed due to difficulty in discerning the exact energy mix between fossil fuels and renewable sources, it is still correlated to the amount of electricity needed to unlock new coins as well as the number of expensive bitcoin miners operating on the network.  Second, investing in bitcoin mining companies has become an extremely popular and lucrative trend for investors looking to get exposure to the industry without purchasing the asset directly. Many have outperformed bitcoin so far this year, sometimes significantly. In fact, large numbers of investors already own shares in these companies, perhaps unknowingly, because of their inclusion in mutual funds offered by asset managers such as <a aria-label=BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/08/19/blackrock-joins-fidelity-and-vanguard-as-a-bitcoin-mining-investor/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/08/19/blackrock-joins-fidelity-and-vanguard-as-a-bitcoin-mining-investor/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/08/19/blackrock-joins-fidelity-and-vanguard-as-a-bitcoin-mining-investor/>BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity</a>.The performance of these stocks has diverged from bitcoin and even popular crypto stocks such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy recently due to a number of factors, such as the premium that they receive from being easily accessible at mainstream bourses to the earnings expectations that come from having the foresight and financial backing to <a aria-label=purchase the always-in-short-supply mining equipment, much of which gets manufactured with multi-month lead times class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/12/bitmain-escalates-bitcoin-mining-arms-race-with-most-powerful-hardware-in-history/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/12/bitmain-escalates-bitcoin-mining-arms-race-with-most-powerful-hardware-in-history/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/12/bitmain-escalates-bitcoin-mining-arms-race-with-most-powerful-hardware-in-history/>purchase the always-in-short-supply mining equipment, much of which gets manufactured with multi-month lead times</a>. It also helps that most of these companies are based in North America, <a aria-label=which has benefited greatly from China exiling virtually all its mining capacity class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/03/bitcoin-mining-stocks-in-north-america-surge-as-companies-press-their-advantage/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/03/bitcoin-mining-stocks-in-north-america-surge-as-companies-press-their-advantage/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/03/bitcoin-mining-stocks-in-north-america-surge-as-companies-press-their-advantage/>which has benefited greatly from China exiling virtually all its mining capacity</a>. In fact, the U.S. is now the world’s largest mining center, something that would have been inconceivable in January.But these reasons just explain macro factors. What about other data points such as the cost of production? As more bitcoin miners go public and research houses increasingly cover the space, analysts are trying to determine a way to measure how expensive bitcoins are to produce for for each of these firms. There is no universally accepted approach according to Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy Digital.“We realized that when you look at mining public mining companies, there's really a few metrics that they all report. It's the current hash rate, future expected capacity and then their cost to mine a coin. So we dug in a little bit and saw that everyone differs on how they calculate their cost per coin; it's not very transparent.”<em>Note Galaxy mining operates mining hosting facilities and conducts proprietary bitcoin mining activities.</em>As a result, Amanda and her team decided to build their own model for calculating the cost of a coin, relying on data reported by companies in regulatory filings. They use three levels of analysis to break down the costs between direct and indirect expenditures, while also accounting for depreciation.Cost of Bitcoin Production CalculatorAlong with the research report, the company is also open-sourcing their model for experimentation within the wider community via an Excel spreadsheet. Brandon Bailey, mining associate at Galaxy notes, “With the open-source spreadsheet, we really wanted to create it in a way that resembled one of those filings so people knew exactly what to look for, go to any company they wanted, pull up their filing and plug it directly into our spreadsheet and have it automatically calculate those different levels of the cost of production. We really tried to make it as user friendly as possible so that anyone can pick it up and do it.”So, what can this model tell us? And what is missing? After all, like any worthwhile model it makes certain key assumptions and excludes certain variables to focus on the most pressing data points. For instance, Galaxy’s model does not incorporate items such as future mining capacity, revenue generated from price appreciation or making balance sheet loans, the relative efficiencies of renewal vs. fossil fuel energy sources. Those can be added in by other analysts using the models.However, it still provides some key takeaways. For instance, miners are starting to utilize different strategies to grow their business. For instance, Marathon hosts most of its miners at third parties and focuses on leveraging its balance sheet to procure as much hashrate as possible. Other firms such as Riot are much more vertically integrated because they control access to power supplies and own the buildings used to house the mining equipment. One approach may not be better than another, but Fabiano says “My expectation is that vertically integrated companies’ cost to mine a coin will stay consistent or decrease over time. If we're able to start tracking these metrics now, we’ll be able to see the impact of owning your own infrastructure on electricity costs.”<br/>   <p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am director of research for digital assets at Forbes.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Busha's teamThere aren’t many countries where residents feel the effect of inflation and currency devaluation as much as in Nigeria. Grocery prices in the country tend to be markedly higher from month to month, and the result is that many Nigerians, whose income remain stagnant, are constantly looking for alternative ways for making money. This, to some extent, tells the story of why <a aria-label=Nigeria has one of the highest crypto adoption rates globally class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2021/09/14/bitcoin-opportunity-africa-adoption-rate-is-highest-globally/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2021/09/14/bitcoin-opportunity-africa-adoption-rate-is-highest-globally/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2021/09/14/bitcoin-opportunity-africa-adoption-rate-is-highest-globally/>Nigeria has one of the highest crypto adoption rates globally</a>. For many Nigerians, cryptocurrency isn’t merely a wealth-building tool; it’s a <em>way out</em>. Still, it’s early days for crypto adoption in the West African country, with only a tiny portion of the population currently using digital assets.Two friends, Michael Adeyeri and Moyo Sodipo, are looking to onboard the next few million Nigerians into the crypto economy.The duo’s company <a aria-label=Busha class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://busha.co href=https://busha.co rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://busha.co>Busha</a> has raised $4.2 million in a seed round led by Jump Capital. Cadenza Ventures, Blockwall Capital, CMT Digital, Greenhouse Capital and Raba Capital also took part in the round.Jump Capital recently raised $350 million for its seventh fund. <em>Forbes</em><strong> </strong><a aria-label=reported class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaszkutak/2021/09/14/jump-capital-raises-350-million-and-doubles-down-on-crypto/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaszkutak/2021/09/14/jump-capital-raises-350-million-and-doubles-down-on-crypto/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaszkutak/2021/09/14/jump-capital-raises-350-million-and-doubles-down-on-crypto/>reported</a> that the venture capital firm is dedicating 40% of the fund to the crypto market.Commenting on his firm’s investment in Busha, Peter Johnson, a partner at Jump said:“We believe Nigeria and the African continent are one of the most promising places for crypto to make a significant impact in offering financial freedom to millions of individuals.”Busha plans to deploy the capital toward product development, growth in Nigeria, expansion to other African countries and talent acquisition. The company expects to set up shops in Ghana, Kenya and a few francophone African countries over the coming months.Busha co-founders Michael Adeyeri (left) and Moyo Sodipo (right).Busha launched in 2019 and has silently amassed over 200,000 registered users (not necessarily the active user count). The company’s growth has been driven by the team’s focus on building what their customers want.“Our approach while building has always been about customer obsession,” said Sodipo, currently Busha’s chief product officer. “We pay so much attention to what our customers want versus what our competitors are doing.”This has helped Busha build trust with its customers so much so that word of mouth has been an important growth tool for the company.“We quickly realized that we were acquiring more customers through referrals just because we were delivering the exact kind of services that they want,” Adeyeri, who serves as Busha’s CEO added.For Busha, being customer-centric involved building a crypto exchange that offered an experience that was as familiar as possible to what’s attainable in Nigeria’s traditional finance sphere.First, Nigeria is one of the only 56 countries that have <a aria-label=enabled real-time payments class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://empower1.fisglobal.com/rs/650-KGE-239/images/Flavors-of-Fast-Report_2020.pdf?mkt_tok=NjUwLUtHRS0yMzkAAAGA6bLxhcNrv_9CEBa4mB6Zj-bazDimHGPsmx_VRlBWUJmlvd6plQxAIAHwLaO6leg7i7jW6PmO7t1aQzjU2_jt5iH1HotUwT2tCpetQloWrEu4QVM href=https://empower1.fisglobal.com/rs/650-KGE-239/images/Flavors-of-Fast-Report_2020.pdf?mkt_tok=NjUwLUtHRS0yMzkAAAGA6bLxhcNrv_9CEBa4mB6Zj-bazDimHGPsmx_VRlBWUJmlvd6plQxAIAHwLaO6leg7i7jW6PmO7t1aQzjU2_jt5iH1HotUwT2tCpetQloWrEu4QVM rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://empower1.fisglobal.com/rs/650-KGE-239/images/Flavors-of-Fast-Report_2020.pdf?mkt_tok=NjUwLUtHRS0yMzkAAAGA6bLxhcNrv_9CEBa4mB6Zj-bazDimHGPsmx_VRlBWUJmlvd6plQxAIAHwLaO6leg7i7jW6PmO7t1aQzjU2_jt5iH1HotUwT2tCpetQloWrEu4QVM>enabled real-time payments</a> in some form. Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc.—owned by all the licensed banks in the country—runs the technology that facilitates instant bank transfers. Busha sought to replicate this experience from the outset by offering instant deposits into users’ wallets and instant bank withdraws. At the time, Luno, a larger, international crypto exchange, processed withdrawals to Nigerian bank accounts only at certain hours during the day.In addition, Nigerians tend to favor services that offer real-time, round-the-clock communication, especially when it relates to financial services. Many Nigerian banks offer 24 hours customer support via different channels.For its part, Busha claims to offer 24-hour live in-app support, with Adeyeri and Sodipo adding that their company was the first Nigerian crypto service to offer round-the-clock withdrawals and live chat.It remains to be seen if the company can sustain its 24 customer support operations as it onboards the next one million users into the crypto economy.For now, though, the exchange is building it future based on customer feedback. “My day to day involves connecting the support and marketing teams with the engineering team to make sure that every feedback that customers give is passed along,” said Sodipo. “We don’t just build based on what we like; we build and ship out features based on what our customers request.”The next step for Busha is to offer features that make crypto usable, Adeyeri added. The company recently launched a redesigned app that now allows users to make recurring crypto purchases, which is the basis of the popular dollar-cost averaging investment strategy. Busha's new app allows users to make recurring crypto purchases.Busha plans to roll out more features over the coming months. In December the exchange will introduce a savings feature that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto.What’s more, during the first quarter of 2022, the exchange will unveil a spend feature to enable its users spend cryptocurrencies at select online and offline retail outlets. “We have a partnership with SureGifts [a gift card company] that will allow our customers spend crypto across their merchant network including Spart, Shoprite and Jumia,” Adeyeri said.Busha isn’t the first or only Nigerian crypto service to tools for spending crypto or making recurring purchases. Bitnob and Accrue already offer dollar-cost averaging features. In addition, Fluidcoin is building out a crypto payment infrastructure.Nigeria’s crypto landscape continues to be uncertain, with the West African country’s central bank banning financial institutions from doing business with cryptocurrency companies earlier in 2021.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial, cryptocurrency and blockchain writer.

Mar 6 2022 07:00am ,"<small>getty</small>Having a pile of money at your fingertips can sometimes lure you into a jungle you best not enter. The problem is that, sooner or later, you’re going to look at your retirement savings account and discover you have a big pile of money. Then, you’re going to have to fight back the urge to gamble.And sometimes, you won’t know you’ve gambled until the casino takes away your last chip.You don’t have to be a Captain Renault to realize cryptocurrencies don’t have the kind of track record needed to assure you they aren’t the same as gambling. “Cryptocurrency is digital currency that’s not part of a bank and is designed to be free from government control — or perhaps better put, a digital, decentralized currency,” says Stuart Robertson, CEO of ShareBuilder <a aria-label=401k class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/what-is-401k/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/what-is-401k/ target=_self>401k</a> in Seattle. “It can be used for the purchase of goods and services wherever it is accepted, and items may be bought anonymously. As it is not part of a bank, it is not FDIC insured. Bitcoin is the most popular player in the cryptocurrency arena, but there are many other providers. Some countries don’t allow for the legal use of cryptocurrency.”Lately, however, there’s been a push to allow <a aria-label=retirement plans class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ target=_self>retirement plans</a> to invest in these newly formed assets. This push isn’t coming just from those who profit from sales of such things as Bitcoin, but also from the novice investors themselves.“With over $32 trillion in retirement funds and approximately $12 trillion of IRAs, most Americans use the retirement system as their primary source for wealth accumulation,” says Adam Bergman, CEO and Founder of IRA Financial in Miami Beach. “Hence, most Americans use their retirement account as the primary savings vehicle. With the growth in the cryptocurrency market, more and more Americans have turned to their retirement account as the vehicle for investing in cryptos.”While there’s not a lot of history (Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, didn’t exist until 2009), what you do see suggests something more akin to high-stakes gambling than long-term investing.“Cryptocurrency investments, such as Bitcoins, are uncertain and highly volatile,” says Bergman. “Any retirement account investor interested in using retirement funds to invest in cryptocurrencies should do their due diligence and proceed with caution. For example, the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate by 5% plus or minus on a given day, which is far more volatile than a mutual fund or most equities.”“It’s not just the performance history, but cryptocurrencies come with other risks,” says Jahon Jamali, Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer at Sarson Funds in Sherman Oaks, California. “As a young asset class (only 11 years old), there have yet to be compressive investor protection laws put around cryptocurrencies. This makes the category susceptible to fraud and/or malfeasance.”Already, however, the investment industry is finding ways to reduce these risks by merging the unregulated investment into regulated products. It’s not clear how much protection this affords, but it’s a start. It also makes cryptocurrency more compatible with generally accepted <a aria-label=retirement plan class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ target=_self>retirement plan</a> platforms and frameworks.“Some of the current push may be a result of recent development of investment products that now allow investors to invest in Bitcoin-related returns in publicly registered funds that are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,” says Karan Sood, Head of Product Development at Cboe Vest in McLean, Virginia. “These products provide investors protections that they have come to expect from investment in other such regulated funds. Some of these mutual funds also implement investment strategies that provide exposure to Bitcoin while controlling for the extreme volatility of Bitcoin.”Usually, ordinary investors don’t take a second look at regulatory requirements. They’re only concerned with one thing, and it’s the same thing that keeps cryptocurrencies in the headlines. Put two and two together and you’ll quickly discover why employees want to place these assets in their 401(k) accounts.“Higher returns dramatically increase the chances of retiring!” says Eddie Yoon, Co-Founder of Category Pirates and Founder of EddieWouldGrow, LLC in New York City.Performance may be a door opener, but there’s more to Bitcoin et al than that. Cryptocurrencies fall neatly into a narrative those following the markets happily buy into. “Cryptocurrencies are still an emerging asset class, but one that has demonstrated strong growth in the past year,” says Chris Panteli, Founder of LifeUpswing in Denver. “Many investors are looking at it as a possible store of value and hedge against geopolitical and macroeconomic risk. These factors suggest that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could become a legitimate asset class in the future and disrupt the global investment landscape.”Even financial professionals are beginning to see how these instruments dovetail nicely into standard portfolio management strategies and tactics.“Diversifying your portfolio for a future where currency will look differently,” says Chris Kline, COO and Co-founder of Bitcoin IRA in Sherman Oaks, California. “People are revolutionizing their retirement savings by being a part of the next wave of economics and are defending themselves from looming inflation ahead. Although volatile, Bitcoin has historically over performed every other asset class over the last five years.”But it is the very nature of that performance that has caused others to step back. Though they may agree cryptocurrencies are, indeed, a unique asset class, they have a different mind when it comes to exactly what kind of asset class it is, and, therefore, where it fits in an investment strategy.“While cryptocurrency is designed to be a medium of exchange, Bitcoin and other cryptos are currently behaving like highly speculative assets which undermines its ability to be an effective currency,” says Robertson. “The speculative nature of these assets requires careful risk management and is likely more appropriate for shorter holding periods than those typically found in retirement plans. Put another way, the current state of cryptocurrencies is better suited for trading rather than investing.” An additional way to look at Bitcoin is to use its trendiness to spur more to invest for retirement. It’s the attraction to investing in it that makes it more likely people who don’t normally <a aria-label=save for retirement class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ target=_self>save for retirement</a> begin to save. Don’t the ends of greater retirement saving justify the means of investing in Bitcoin?“The country is facing a retirement epidemic,” says Chris Gure, a financial consultant in Raleigh, North Carolina. “People are not interested in saving for their future. They are interested in Bitcoin. This is a way to re-engage retirement plan participants and let them invest in their own future. The tax benefits of wrapping your investment in a retirement account is an obvious plus!”Of course, not all agree with this Machiavellian model of retirement saving and investing. They would suggest the downside negates the upside.“The most important goal of <a aria-label=retirement planning class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/best-retirement-plans/ target=_self>retirement planning</a> is not running out of money,” says John Kauth, CEO of Intercontinental Wealth Advisors in San Antonio. “Having an asset class that can gain or lose 50% of its value in a matter of a few days does not belong in a retirement plan.”“Cryptocurrency should not be part of an allocation of assets designed to meet future goals such as saving for a child’s education, purchasing a home, or funding retirement needs,” says Shelly-Ann N. Eweka, Senior Director, Financial Planning Strategy at TIAA in Charlotte, North Carolina. “While the lack of governing authority is sometimes touted as a cryptocurrency feature rather than a bug, I would argue the reverse is true.”Eweka has plenty of reasons to support her position. She says “cryptocurrencies are not driven by the traditional supply and demand fundamentals that help determine the underlying value of other asset classes. This leads to a lack of transparency, increases the volatility of cryptocurrencies, and makes them unreliable as an investable asset and as a store of value. They have no risk premium, and do not produce income or cash flows.”Perhaps most importantly, Eweka reminds everyone who has ever been frustrated trying to find a lost password what might be the greatest risk to investing directly into assets like Bitcoin. “If your 256-bit private key is lost/stolen, you no longer own the cryptocurrency,” she says, “and you permanently lose those digital assets.”It is these types of risks that retirement plan sponsors have to consider before agreeing to include cryptocurrencies in their plans’ investment options menus. In addition, if they do allow such investments, they must be prepared to do other things to ensure employees invest knowingly.“The ramifications for retirement plan fiduciaries regarding allowing Bitcoin investing into their plans is increased education and communication,” says Daniel Strachman, Managing Partner at A&amp;C Advisors in Coral Springs, Florida. “Although this move for fiduciaries is unclear based on the limited regulations on Bitcoin to date, one would expect the plan fiduciaries would have to use the same standard of care for Bitcoin as they do for any other asset class. They will need to provide extensive education and information about the asset and make sure the plan participants understand the risks of investing in such a volatile asset.”What will it take to move cryptocurrencies out of the danger zone? And will they lose their allure when that happens?“Think about this,” says Robertson. “Are you comfortable getting your paycheck in Bitcoin? Most will say ‘No.’ When you can say ‘Yes,’ it will have made it through many hurdles and many of the risks discussed here will be resolved. And, that could also mean returns more in line with cash. We will see.”When it comes to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, we are still in the formative “Wild West” years. There will be a few pioneers brave enough to venture into the raw winds of the open prairie, but you may prefer to wait. Will you miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? Maybe. But you’re probably happy just not to bet it all on red only to see the roulette wheel stop with the ball on black 22.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description='&lt;p&gt;Author of the newly published The Parents Guide To Turning Your Teen Into A Millionaire: And How To Do It Before High School Graduation!

Not everyone else is against bitcoin and crypto though, with two U.S. mayors, Eric Adams in New York and Miami's Francis Suarez, both championing bitcoin adoption.<strong>Bond villain:</strong> El Salvador's bitcoin-touting president Nayib Bukele, who in September proclaimed himself dictator of El Salvador on Twitter in an apparent joke, revealed the plan on stage at the culmination of a week of bitcoin promotion El Salvador and Likened the plan to cities founded by Alexander the Great. To fund the project, El Salvador will issue $1 billion bitcoin bonds from early 2022, it was announced by Blockstream chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, speaking alongside Bukele. Bukele said the city would have no property, income or capital gains taxes but will be funded by a sales tax and money raised from the bonds. Invest here and make all the money you want, said Bukele, dressed all in white and wearing a baseball cap backwards, said in the beach resort of Mizata.

AVAX was one of just two top 20 cryptocurrencies to grow over the last week AVAX was trading at around $134 on Monday morning, a jump of around 40% over the past week, according to <a aria-label=CoinGecko class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coingecko.com/en href=https://www.coingecko.com/en rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coingecko.com/en>CoinGecko</a>.The rally took AVAX’s market cap to just under $30 billion, marginally overtaking dogecoin as the tenth most valuable cryptocurrency. AVAX’s soaring value comes amid a market-wide crash that has seen most major tokens—including all top-ten cryptocurrencies not pegged to other assets: bitcoin, ether, Binance coin, solana, cardano, XRP and polkadot—drop by double-digit percentages over the past seven days.The token’s price surged after professional services firm Deloitte <a aria-label=announced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://medium.com/avalancheavax/deloitte-leverages-avalanche-to-improve-recoveries-from-natural-disasters-and-public-health-4fa3fd3644bf href=https://medium.com/avalancheavax/deloitte-leverages-avalanche-to-improve-recoveries-from-natural-disasters-and-public-health-4fa3fd3644bf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://medium.com/avalancheavax/deloitte-leverages-avalanche-to-improve-recoveries-from-natural-disasters-and-public-health-4fa3fd3644bf>announced</a> plans last week to use Avalanche’s technology to build better U.S. disaster relief platforms.  The price of AVAX has more than doubled in the past 30 days and grown more than 3,000% over the year. Dogecoin v AVAX. Cryptocurrencies are a notoriously volatile asset class and even assets at the very top of the market are not immune to wild and rapid fluctuations. Both AVAX and dogecoin have market capitalizations of around $30 billion—with around $200 million separating the two at the time of writing—and are jostling for the number 10 cryptocurrency slot. AVAX already (briefly) overtook dogecoin once before on Sunday when it reached a record high of $144.96, before falling back to number 11. <a aria-label=Dogecoin class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/01/28/its-doge-time-dogecoin-surges-as-reddit-traders-push-to-make-it-the-crypto-gamestop/?sh=44534895217e href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/01/28/its-doge-time-dogecoin-surges-as-reddit-traders-push-to-make-it-the-crypto-gamestop/?sh=44534895217e target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/01/28/its-doge-time-dogecoin-surges-as-reddit-traders-push-to-make-it-the-crypto-gamestop/?sh=44534895217e>Dogecoin</a>, along with a parody <a aria-label=Shiba Inu class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.protocol.com/fintech/shiba-inu-dogecoin-squid-crypto href=https://www.protocol.com/fintech/shiba-inu-dogecoin-squid-crypto rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.protocol.com/fintech/shiba-inu-dogecoin-squid-crypto>Shiba Inu</a> (sitting at number 12), are perhaps more volatile than most assets, having started off as jokes and taken on new lives as popular memes.  AVAX’s gains defy a market-wide crash that has seen hundreds of billions in value wiped from the crypto market. It erased some of the gains made throughout the pandemic—though the market is still substantially larger than before the pandemic—when the sector thrived with an influx of retail investors, a wider array of options to trade digital currencies, growing public and institutional interest in cryptocurrency and the soaring popularity of meme stocks and tokens. At its current value, AVAX is valued more than social media company <a aria-label=Pinterest class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PINS/ href=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PINS/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PINS/>Pinterest</a>, bank <a aria-label=Société Générale class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/gle.pa/ href=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/gle.pa/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/gle.pa/>Société Générale</a> and <a aria-label=Southwest Airlines class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LUV/ href=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LUV/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LUV/>Southwest Airlines</a>.   <a aria-label=Hundreds Of Billions Lost As Major Cryptocurrencies—Including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano—Tumble In Crypto Crash class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/11/16/hundreds-of-billions-lost-as-major-cryptocurrencies-including-bitcoin-ethereum-solana-cardano-tumble-in-crypto-crash/?sh=6f1817f32925 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/11/16/hundreds-of-billions-lost-as-major-cryptocurrencies-including-bitcoin-ethereum-solana-cardano-tumble-in-crypto-crash/?sh=6f1817f32925 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/11/16/hundreds-of-billions-lost-as-major-cryptocurrencies-including-bitcoin-ethereum-solana-cardano-tumble-in-crypto-crash/?sh=6f1817f32925>Hundreds Of Billions Lost As Major Cryptocurrencies—Including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano—Tumble In Crypto Crash</a> (Forbes)<a aria-label=Avalanche Launches $220 Million Crypto Growth Fund Targeting DeFi And NFTs class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/11/01/avalanche-launches-220-million-crypto-growth-fund-targeting-defi-and-nfts/?sh=25adcd6350e1 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/11/01/avalanche-launches-220-million-crypto-growth-fund-targeting-defi-and-nfts/?sh=25adcd6350e1 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/11/01/avalanche-launches-220-million-crypto-growth-fund-targeting-defi-and-nfts/?sh=25adcd6350e1>Avalanche Launches $220 Million Crypto Growth Fund Targeting DeFi And NFTs</a> (Forbes)<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a London-based reporter for Forbes covering breaking news.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Not licked yetHaving written just yesterday about <a aria-label=how bitcoin can liberate people from the toxic effect of inflation on their savings class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/11/20/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-weapon-society-has-against-inflation-and-wealth-inequality/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/11/20/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-weapon-society-has-against-inflation-and-wealth-inequality/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2021/11/20/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-weapon-society-has-against-inflation-and-wealth-inequality/>how bitcoin can liberate people from the toxic effect of inflation on their savings</a>, it might seem odd that I’m now publishing an article with the headline “cash is still king”.The reality, though, is that reducing society’s dependence on government-issued money will take time.For the vast majority of people, incomings and outgoings are denominated solely in local fiat currency. If you’re American, you almost certainly earn your salary in USD and use that USD balance to fund your living expenses. Depending on your personal circumstances and preferences, you likely hold a greater or lesser portion of that money in physical cash.It makes perfect sense, therefore, that the fintech industry would seek to enable frictionless transfers between cash and crypto – both for practical reasons, and as a segue to a more fully digitized financial world.“There might be a kind of digital Utopia vision for the future, but the reality is a large portion of the market still interacts with cash on a daily basis,” explained Neil Bergquist, chief executive of Coinme, a Seattle-based crypto exchange that specializes in cash conversions.“In order to pursue Satoshi's vision of a global peer-to-peer electronic cash system you need a cash on-ramp – cash is literally in the headline of the bitcoin white paper – but it’s not easy [to build]. It's messy. It's more complicated than just offering an additional payment type.”Coinme launched operations in 2014 as one of the world’s first providers of bitcoin ATMs, but the company has now ditched its hardware in favor of two partnerships with Coinstar and MoneyGram.Coinstar runs a global network of 20,000 machines – typically located in grocery stores – that guzzle spare change and spit out either banknotes or electronic giftcards. MoneyGram specializes in cross-border remittances, running 350,000 walk-in locations around the world where customers can deposit cash and send money to friends or relatives.About half of Coinstar’s kiosks will be crypto-enabled by the end of this year, Bergquist said, up from about 7,000 today. The upgraded machines allow you to deposit up to $2,500 cash in exchange for a printed receipt with a code, which is then used to redeem bitcoin on your Coinme account.The MoneyGram partnership, meanwhile, involves customers either handing over or receiving cash in exchange for bitcoin simply by giving their instruction to the teller.“The only reason we did [our own] ATMs back in 2014 through 2019 was because bitcoin and digital currency were still very early,” Bergquist recalled. “A lot of the existing financial institutions didn't take it seriously.”He described the market cycle top in 2017 – when bitcoin peaked just shy of $20,000 – as a watershed moment for industry acceptance.“After that, Coinstar, for example, saw bitcoin as a potential legitimate opportunity … Coinstar has over 20,000 kiosks globally. It would have taken us a very long time to deploy that many machines, so being able to use their existing infrastructure helps to solve the access and scale problem for the industry. And now with MoneyGram we have another opportunity to crypto-enable.”Part of the complexity of dealing with cash stems from greater regulatory scrutiny – particularly in relation to anti-money laundering laws – so both channels require customers to verify their identity before completing a transaction. Coinme uses standard Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols for these checks, meaning that personal documents must be submitted but there’s no requirement to provide bank account statements.That matters because cash-based services are particularly attractive to <a aria-label=the estimated 22% of Americans – about 72 million people – who are either unbanked or underbanked class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-banking-and-credit.htm href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-banking-and-credit.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-banking-and-credit.htm>the estimated 22% of Americans – about 72 million people – who are either unbanked or underbanked</a>.It’s worth stressing, though, that the convenience of cash comes at a price.Bergquist estimated that Coinstar’s bitcoin customers pay a 4% transaction fee plus a variable exchange-rate fee of up to 7%. MoneyGram imposes a flat $2.75 fee plus a variable exchange rate costing up to 4%.“If you want to do a higher dollar amount, MoneyGram can be less expensive [than Coinstar],” he said. “But it really depends on the convenience of the location and the timing ... Bitcoin is volatile, and being able to transact at the time you want to transact seems to be the primary motivation [for customers].”He justified the fees by pointing to Coinme’s relatively high costbase – another consequence of dealing with physical money. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, Coinme spends a significant sum on its cash logistics network as well as paying a premium to banking partners for the perceived higher risk of cash transactions. Its financial audits are also costlier than normal.Expansion into Latin America is a top priority for the company, Bergquist said, with partnerships “teed up to activate” in the first quarter of 2022.“The United States sends over $150 billion a year to other countries,” he noted. “If we're able to build the cash launchpad in the United States, then we're able to essentially follow the money – to expand into those countries that receive money from the United States. And, for example, there’s about $80 billion that goes to Latin America every year.“So we've been investing heavily in order to launch in central and South America in Q1 of next year ... We're targeting pretty much every country except for Bolivia and Venezuela.”<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am an aviation journalist turned crypto reporter whose work has appeared in The Guardian, The Economist, The New York Times, Flightglobal, African Business, Al Arabiya &amp;amp; New Eastern Europe.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"A new dawn?For bitcoin enthusiasts, one of the most compelling things about the cryptocurrency is its ability to side-step fiat monetary systems that dilute the value of cash holdings through inflation.That isn’t anywhere near as complicated as it sounds. Put very simply, central banks grease the wheels of their economies by continually printing new money. A higher money supply makes it easier for companies to spend and service their debt. But there’s a catch: for every new dollar you add to the spending pool, the buying power of each individual dollar falls proportionally.Again this is simpler than it sounds: changing the money supply doesn’t magically create wealth or value. If your economy is a nursery and your money supply is crayons, then doubling the number of crayons in the room doesn’t make the kids any richer. They all have twice as many crayons as they had before, so they all double the number they offer when bartering for toys, books and so on. In real terms, nothing has changed because the new supply of money is being evenly shared between everyone in the nursery.Where things get more complicated – and where bitcoiners have rightly identified a need for a different, fairer system – is what happens when supply and distribution <em>aren’t</em> evenly matched?Central bankers claim this isn’t a concern, because they contend that all the cash ultimately trickles down to the man on the street – be it through stimulus checks or higher wages or fatter pension funds or whatever other pathway they conjure up. In practice, of course, we know that simply doesn’t reflect reality.<a aria-label=In the real world, billionaires have, by far, been the biggest winners from covid-era money printing class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.ft.com/content/747a76dd-f018-4d0d-a9f3-4069bf2f5a93 href=https://www.ft.com/content/747a76dd-f018-4d0d-a9f3-4069bf2f5a93 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.ft.com/content/747a76dd-f018-4d0d-a9f3-4069bf2f5a93>In the real world, billionaires have, by far, been the biggest winners from covid-era money printing</a>. They’ve taken their higher money supply (including vast sums of borrowed money, which is cheaper and easier to obtain when interest rates are low) and they’ve pumped it into inflation-beating asset classes such as the stock market, real estate, collectibles and so on. The middle classes have done the same, but on a smaller scale: building their savings during covid lockdowns and then allocating a healthy chunk of those funds to assets that have appreciated in value nicely.Now consider the poor and the working classes. What little bonus cash they’ve received during the pandemic has either been spent on survival or stagnated. Unable to get on the property ladder, they can neither benefit from rising house prices nor start building equity by replacing rent (money that goes into someone else’s pot) with mortgage payments (money that goes into their own). Stock markets may, technically, be within their reach, but at a profound handicap due to high transaction fees and a limited understanding of investment strategies (the kind of knowhow that rich people simply pay someone else to worry about).This imbalance results in one thing: inequality.If you’re rich, you can take a higher money supply and use it to your advantage. If you’re poor, you really can’t. You’re stuck with whatever cash holdings you have in the new economy. And, as we know, the value of those holdings is actively being diluted through inflation. The more money is printed, the poorer you get.Interest rates, of course, <em>could</em> save the day – if central banks <em>wanted</em> them to. When the interest rate rises above the inflation rate, any of us can grow the value of our cash simply by dumping it in a savings account. But <a aria-label=policymakers don’t want this class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/investors-expect-policy-errors-as-major-central-banks-reiterate-wait-and-see-approach.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/investors-expect-policy-errors-as-major-central-banks-reiterate-wait-and-see-approach.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/investors-expect-policy-errors-as-major-central-banks-reiterate-wait-and-see-approach.html>policymakers don’t want this</a>, because just about the only thing holding up the global economy right now is easy access to debt. As soon as the interest rate paid by borrowers increases, the shaky foundations of our covid-era economic recovery will collapse. Businesses and homeowners who binged on cheap loans will suddenly be unable to make repayments. Waves of bankruptcies and foreclosures will cripple the global economy.Small wonder that central bankers – none of whom are working class, by the way – prefer the easy option of hammering poor people. “This might not be perfect,” they rationalize, “but everything seems to be stable and everyone I know is doing rather well!” That, in a nutshell, tells you why <a aria-label=central banks are the biggest driver of wealth inequality class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-economic-policy-powell-inflation-51631120497 href=https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-economic-policy-powell-inflation-51631120497 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-economic-policy-powell-inflation-51631120497>central banks are the biggest driver of wealth inequality</a>.So, what to do? Well, as long as central bankers and politicians are in the driving seat, there’s really no way of changing the direction of this economic journey. Those in power will always promote policies that advance their own personal interests, and they will do whatever is necessary to delay a global economic crash – even one that would, in the long-run, probably be good for society as it would precipitate structural reforms to the current, broken system.If there is a solution, it would have to be an alternative monetary system that’s resilient to both inflation and central bank manipulation.No prizes for stating the obvious there: civilization has aspired to have such a system for millennia. Trouble is, it’s never been that easy to build a monetary network that’s backed by no-one and yet protects the interests of everyone so convincingly that ordinary people will trust it with their life savings. Never, that is, until 2009, when the launch of the bitcoin monetary network gave the world its first taste of decentralized blockchain technology.Convincing readers about the technical benefits of blockchain is a bit like convincing overweight people about the health benefits of dieting. The proof is in the pudding, as it were. And the average person on the street has no more inclination to become an expert in food science – the ‘how’ or ‘why’ a given diet is effective – than they do computer programming.That said, you can’t understand the genius behind bitcoin without having at least a basic grasp of the revolutionary nature of blockchain technology – so here goes.Trust is everything. I’ve already alluded to the fact that creating a monetary system from scratch is virtually impossible because money has no value unless enough people <em>believe</em> it has value. The easiest way to foster that belief is to get a government to pledge to uphold – or back – its value (think of that “promise to pay the bearer on demand” you see on banknotes). Another, more tenuous way is to come up with a universally appealing asset that has a fixed supply. Gold ticks this box nicely: it’s aesthetically attractive; it can’t be forged because of its unique density; and it can’t be manufactured by anyone, so there’ll only ever be as much gold on the planet as the planet already holds (shiny asteroids notwithstanding).Then again, gold is a pain in the ass. It’s heavy, so it’s a burden to carry and transfer. It’s not easily divisible, so it’s hard to pay precise amounts with it. Not many people do their weekly shop with gold. But what if you could create a <em>digital version</em> of gold that weighs nothing, moves at the speed of light, and is divisible to the tiniest fraction of value. Sounds great. Also impossible. Until 2009.If you only understand one thing about what blockchain technology does, let it be this: for the first time in history, blockchains give us genuinely immutable data.That means the information contained within them cannot be changed. Ever. How they achieve this takes time to understand: it’s to do with the decentralized nature of the ledger, which lists all the transactions ever made on the blockchain and is secured by 1) the number of copies in existence (full nodes, all of which are cross-checked against each other); 2) the process through which new data is written (cryptographic encryption); and 3) the energy consumption of the network (the hashrate, which makes it impossible to overpower – or change the course of – the encryption process). I might have lost you there. But the end result isn’t difficult to grasp. <em>Once you have immutable data, you have the ability to create autonomous digital money.</em>By ensuring that bitcoin’s transaction history can never be altered, mankind has created a digital asset that satisfies five of the criteria for money: it’s durable, portable, scarce, divisible and fungible (interchangeable). The final criteria – acceptability, or the willingness of people to conceive of bitcoin as real money – will be determined not by its technical traits but by humanity’s attitude towards it. In an increasingly digital age, the outlook is favorable.Bitcoin’s detractors – and there are many; typically old, middle class people who’ve become very rich from the status quo – cite a different definition of money: that it must be embraced by society as a medium of exchange; a unit of account; and a store of value.Bitcoin fails on all fronts, they say, as too few people use it on a daily basis, and the price is too volatile to measure or store value. Maybe so, today. But it’s also attained a market cap of $1 trillion in just 12 years. Is that not rather swift progress?And what of the dollar and the other fiat currencies? Are they convenient mediums of exchange across international borders? Do they give us stable, predictable prices year after year? Most important of all, are they a store of value in an era of high inflation? If you’ve ever complained about the rising cost of living, you already know the answer.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am an aviation journalist turned crypto reporter whose work has appeared in The Guardian, The Economist, The New York Times, Flightglobal, African Business, Al Arabiya &amp;amp; New Eastern Europe.

This week, analysts at JPMorgan reeled in their prediction of when the Fed will act to curtail inflation, now putting their rate hike prediction at September next year, bringing it forward from 2023. JPMorgan now expects the Fed to raise rates by 0.25% from the third quarter of next year and keep raising them by 25 basis points every quarter at least until real rates are at zero, it was reported by <a aria-label=Reuters class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-start-raising-interest-rates-sept-2022-jp-morgan-2021-11-18/ href=https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-start-raising-interest-rates-sept-2022-jp-morgan-2021-11-18/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-start-raising-interest-rates-sept-2022-jp-morgan-2021-11-18/><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-start-raising-interest-rates-sept-2022-jp-morgan-2021-11-18/>Reuters</em></a>. I don't think the Fed is going to do anything very quickly and this has been part of the wall of worry in the stock market as well and yet the stock market has continued to go up, said Wood, who's made a name for herself with big bets on bitcoin and Elon Musk's electric car company Tesla. You will have corrections for sure if the crypto market continues to scale as dramatically as it has recently, you'll have those fears grip the market from time to time as people simply take profits because the profits have been enormous in the past year.However, despite raising concerns over short-term price volatility, Wood remains bullish on both bitcoin and ethereum.The reason we've used the $500,000 mark for a bitcoin price target is that if institutional investors move into bitcoin and allocate 5% of their portfolios to it, by our estimates bitcoin will go up by $500,000, said Wood. We can tell this is happening by looking at on-chain analytics, referring to bitcoin's transactions being visible to anyone via its public blockchain.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>Bitcoin's huge price rally this year could mean investors look to take profits if they predict the <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> bitcoin price bull run could be coming to an end. </span>We can see who's moving in and it looks like strong, institutional holders are moving in [to bitcoin], she said, asking: Why are they moving in? Because the correlation of returns among crypto, especially bitcoin, and other assets—stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities—are very low. Studies tell us that if there's a low correlation of returns among assets, [buying] that asset with the low correlation, you will be raising returns and lowering risk over time.Wood named a report by Cambridge Associates from 2019 that advised institutional investors to look into bitcoin and crypto. What we didn't expect when we did our own study on bitcoin, we didn't expect institutions, mainly corporations, to begin diversifying their cash on the balance sheet into bitcoin, said Wood. Tesla, run by bitcoin and crypto fan Elon Musk, has popularized the idea companies could add bitcoin to their balance sheet, following in the footsteps of business sofware company Microstrategy. [Company, corporate and institution interest] will be another source of demand going forward, especially if the Financial Accounting Standards Board changes the accounting rules and shifts away from treating bitcoin as an intangible asset, said Wood.Wood said she's also still upbeat about ethereum's prospects, after the ethereum price has leaped over the last year amid a surge of interest in blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—both largely built on top of ethereum's network.We've become just as bullish on [ethereum], Wood said.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Solana prices climbed today, as the broader digital currency market moved higher. Photographer: <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Gabby Jones/Bloomberg</span>Solana’s sol token rallied today, climbing as the digital currency benefited from a broader recovery in cryptocurrencies. The digital token, which is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain network, reached $219.96 around 12:40 p.m. ET, <a aria-label=Messari data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://messari.io/asset/solana href=https://messari.io/asset/solana rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://messari.io/asset/solana>Messari data</a> reveals. At this point, the cryptocurrency was up nearly 18% from its recent low of $186.75 that it reached yesterday on Messari. The sol token experienced these gains after bitcoin bounced off support above $55,000 and many altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin) followed the world’s most prominent digital currency higher, <a aria-label=CoinMarketCap figures class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://coinmarketcap.com/ href=https://coinmarketcap.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://coinmarketcap.com/>CoinMarketCap figures</a> show. At the time of this report, sol was up more over the last 24 hours than any of the other top 10 digital currencies on CoinMarketCap, as ranked by total market value. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining these recent price movements, analysts highlighted a handful of variables. “Solana’s bounce can be explained on account of two factors,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a aria-label=BitBull Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ href=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/>BitBull Capital</a>. He emphasized bitcoin’s recent strength, and how it has served as a boon to the sentiment of investors. “Firstly, Bitcoin’s bounce from support around $55,500 has given the market renewed confidence and nearly all alts have risen since then,” said DiPasquale. “Secondly, in instances like this, the market tends to favor coins that showed strength prior to the price drop,” he stated. “In this case, Solana has been one of the biggest performers this year and has had a solid run. So it is natural for it to have a strong bounce any time the market starts looking positive.” The digital currency has experienced some very impressive gains in 2021, being up more than 13,000 year-to-date at the time of this writing. When clarifying the sol token’s most recent price movements, Andrew Rossow, an internet and technology attorney, offered a similar take to that of DiPasquale. “Bitcoin’s bounce back will almost invariably provide the market with that small percentage of confidence lost in any small dip,” he stated. “However, because of the growth and increase of altcoins during that same time period, it only adds that necessary enforcement and support needed for market participants to have that continued faith in Bitcoin’s pricing,” said Rossow. Further, he shed some light on why sol, in particular, rallied lately. “The market will always favor coins that have shown just enough strength prior to any price drop,” Rossow noted. “In this case, due to Solana’s prior history of success and stability, there is still a large percentage of the market that has that confidence and faith, so in the event there is a slight market drop, it’s not too much of a concern due to that expectation it would quickly redirect to positive growth.” <strong>Solana’s High Bandwidth</strong>In a crowded field of projects, Solana has managed to stand out for its ability to process a large number of transactions.

At this point, it had lost almost 18% of its value after hitting an all-time high of nearly $69,000 earlier this month. Further, it was trading at the least since October 13.

[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

The price of bitcoin collapses on Friday around the world and has just dropped below $ 11,000 on some platforms, particularly in Asia. On December 19, the virtual currency was worth $ 18,000 and analysts saw it still climb to $ 20,000. Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lightcoin have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)</span>In past weeks, three new Bitcoin Exchanged Traded Funds (ETFs) have launched. All follow a similar model in tracking Bitcoin futures, rather than tracking the spot price of Bitcoin. Assuming you want Bitcoin exposure in your portfolio, which ETF is best?Often the first ETF in a category can gain the most assets. We’ve seen that with Bitcoin ETFs, the <a aria-label=ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which was the first to launch class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2021/10/20/the-first-bitcoin-etf-is-finally-here-is-it-for-you/?sh=3ee1f3d94106 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2021/10/20/the-first-bitcoin-etf-is-finally-here-is-it-for-you/?sh=3ee1f3d94106 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2021/10/20/the-first-bitcoin-etf-is-finally-here-is-it-for-you/?sh=3ee1f3d94106>ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which was the first to launch</a> now holds over a billion in assets. That’s a very fast ramp up for a new fund.However, we now also have the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF). At a high level these are all very similar, holding Bitcoin futures as a way to track the Bitcoin price. Conceptually, there are other approaches out there, such as tracking the Bitcoin spot price. However, the SEC has not approved those implementations in a U.S. ETF structure so far, so are current ETFs track futures. If you want to track the Bitcoin price, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is one investment option. However, it charges a relatively high 2% annual fee and is not structured as an ETF currently. Also, <a aria-label=since February of this year it has generally been trading at a discount to the value of its Bitcoin holdings class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav href=https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav>since February of this year it has generally been trading at a discount to the value of its Bitcoin holdings</a>.Given that the investment strategies of the three Bitcoin ETFs are similar performance may be too, so going with the least expensive ETF can be a sound approach. In this case that’s the VanEck Bitcoing Strategy ETF, which charges 0.65% a year currently. That means you’ll pay around $65 each year for every $10,000 you invest. Fees on the ProShares and Valkyrie’s offering are currently higher at 0.95%. The expense ratio is likely your main cost if you’re a long-term holder of the ETF. However, if you trade very frequently, then the ProShares offering may be the best choice because its currently larger size may lead to improved liquidity and lower bid/ask spreads. The three ETFs also have slightly different tax structures too, which may have implications for long-term holders.We are likely still in the early innings of cryptocurrency funds. An ETF that tracks spot Bitcoin rather than the futures market is likely to receive approval at some point in the coming years. Though there are pros and cons to tracking spot prices rather than futures. A fund that tracks spot Bitcoin isn’t necessarily better.In addition, an ETF that combines various cryptocurrency assets and hence offers broader diversification may also be launched at some point. However, for now with three ETFs following broadly similar Bitcoin strategies, owning the lowest fee option from VanEck may make sense for now for many investors when returns across all three ETF may be similar. That said, innovation is moving quite fast and more innovative and lower costs cryptocurrency ETFs may be coming relatively soon. So today’s analysis on the most appropriate ETF may soon be outdated. Even so the general principle of picking lower cost ETFs when investment strategies are similar, may help your long-term returns.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;Simon is the author of Digital Wealth and Strategic Project Portfolio Management.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"WASHINGTON - JANUARY 22: The Federal Reserve building is seen January 22, 2008 in Washington, DC. <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point after two days of tumult in international markets due to fear of a recession in the United States. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</span>Mar 15, 2020. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Amidst the brewing of a worldwide pandemic and global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve called an emergency meeting where it announced a rate cut to zero and launched a massive $700 billion quantitative easing (QE) program. Since then, we’ve witnessed an unprecedented expansion in the Fed’s balance sheet and appreciation in financial asset prices. Trillions of dollars of liquidity were injected into the economy to prevent a global slowdown that could have rivaled the 2008 global financial crisis.The Fed has bought $4 trillion of bonds in the past 18 monthsThe results of this liquidity injection are unsurprising - as Howard Marks recently <a aria-label=said class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-08-05/oaktree-s-marks-says-markets-are-in-an-everything-bubble-video href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-08-05/oaktree-s-marks-says-markets-are-in-an-everything-bubble-video rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-08-05/oaktree-s-marks-says-markets-are-in-an-everything-bubble-video>said</a>, we’re in an “Everything Bubble”. Approximately 25% of all global government debt is negative yielding. Equity markets are breaking all time highs on a daily basis, with over $600 billion flowing into global equity funds as of August 2021 (equating to $4B/ day). There were over 100 SPAC IPOs in March 2021 alone. Global PE dry powder hit an all-time high of $1.9 trillion in January of 2021. VC funds deployed almost $160 billion in just the third quarter of 2021, with private market valuations soaring across the board. The overall crypto market cap topped $3 trillion, with Bitcoin up over 800% in the past 15 months.“QE Infinity turned your savings account into your checking account, the bond market into your <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> savings account, the equity market into the bond market, the venture market into the equity market, and the crypto market into the new venture market.”</span>Over the past year and a half, we’ve seen one of the greatest creations of wealth in human history, catalyzed by trillions of dollars of monetary and fiscal stimulus across the globe. But with great wealth creation, comes great price appreciation. And price appreciation, aka <em>inflation</em>, is exactly what we’re starting to see from U.S economic data. Just last week, U.S inflation <a aria-label=hit class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-october-2021-11636491959 href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-october-2021-11636491959 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-october-2021-11636491959>hit</a> a 31-year high with consumer prices jumping over 6% from a year ago. The big question on everyone’s minds is whether the uptick in inflation that we’re seeing is “<em>transitory</em>”, as the Fed claims it is, or more permanent that would eventually force the Fed to tighten monetary policy (a process known as “<em>tapering</em>”). The thesis for transitory inflation is simple - COVID induced supply chain shortages, combined with pent up consumer demand for services have temporarily inflated prices. As the global economy restarts, these effects should prove to be ephemeral. To top it off, technology, automation, and globalization should have deflationary effects in the medium-term.On the other hand, some <a aria-label=argue class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bridgewater.com/its-mostly-a-demand-shock-not-a-supply-shock-and-its-everywhere href=https://www.bridgewater.com/its-mostly-a-demand-shock-not-a-supply-shock-and-its-everywhere rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bridgewater.com/its-mostly-a-demand-shock-not-a-supply-shock-and-its-everywhere>argue</a> that we are headed for a significant period of higher inflation due to a demand shock induced by the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy. An estimated $2 trillion was added to consumer balance sheets in 2020, and this wealth effect could translate to a more permanent increase in consumer demand that will outstrip supply and production capabilities.The issue is that demand has exploded, creating an imbalance of a magnitude that we haven’t seen <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> since the 1970s.</span>At a very high level, the Fed has two broad mandates:The Fed is hence always playing a balancing act - cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy when unemployment is too high and hiking rates to combat inflation when the economy is overheated. When done effectively, this stabilizes the economy and reduces volatility in financial markets across debt cycles. When done ineffectively, this leads to stagflation - low economic growth in times of high inflation, where the effects of monetary policy tools are highly limited.<em>“The Federal Reserve…is in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.” </em>– Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin, Jr., October 1955.As inflation has been ticking up over the past few months, the Fed has been forced to react. In its most recent meeting, the Fed announced a plan to reduce the monthly pace of asset purchases (which is currently at $120 billion/ month) by $15 billion a month starting in November and to end the program entirely by the middle of next year. The big question now becomes <em>when</em> will the Fed begin to hike interest rates? While the market is pricing in two hikes by the end of 2022, Fed officials are currently much less aggressive in their expectations. In essence, the market is signaling to the Fed that inflation concerns are serious. As this narrative continues and more inflation data trickles in, the Fed will likely come under increasing pressure to hike rates sooner than intended.Each blue dot represents an FOMC participant’s estimate for the fed funds rate at the end of 2022. The implications of the broader macro environment and inflation concerns on Bitcoin are two-fold. On one hand, Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, so more inflation makes it more valuable. On the other hand, higher inflation implies higher interest rates. This would lead to risk assets, including Bitcoin, selling off.Empirical data is not helpful in resolving this dilemma. While Bitcoin has generally appreciated alongside rising inflation expectations, its longer-term historical relationships with inflation and gold have been relatively weak.Historically, no clear correlation trends to validation the inflation hedge thesisBitcoin price has been tracking US 10 year yields over the past year. If this trend continues, that would be supportive of the “inflation hedge” thesis, and we would see Bitcoin appreciate as the Fed hikes rates to combat inflation.Over the past year, Bitcoin price has been moving in line with 10yr ratesHowever, over the past couple of years, we’ve increasingly seen Bitcoin trade in line with other risk assets such as equities. As larger asset managers and institutional investors allocate more capital towards the crypto ecosystem, this is a trend we can expect to continue going forward. Given this relationship, a tightening in monetary policy in response to rising inflation would be bearish for Bitcoin and all risk assets more broadly.Bitcoin's 30-day rolling correlation with the S&amp;P 500So where does this leave us? In short, although the Fed may say otherwise, the market is pricing in sustained inflation and aggressive Fed rate hikes by the end of next year. If this does happen, it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin reacts. While the “inflation hedge” thesis should be supportive of Bitcoin prices, its increasing correlation with risk assets could cause significant downward price pressure as the tightening of monetary policy causes valuations to collapse across the board.The ultimate goal of Bitcoin was to create a decentralized currency, shielded from the monetary policy of any central bank. However as crypto markets integrate with traditional financial markets, and more institutional capital flows into digital assets, that goal increasingly becomes a myth. How the next year plays out will be crucial in determining the narrative for Bitcoin - is it truly a store of value or is it now a risky asset?<a class=color-link href=https://github.com/rahulrai121/BlockTower_disclaimers/blob/main/README.md rel=nofollow noopener target=_blank title=https://github.com/rahulrai121/BlockTower_disclaimers/blob/main/README.md>DISCLAIMERS</a><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am the Co-Head of Market-Neutral at BlockTower Capital, a multi-strategy crypto hedge fund investing across cryptoassets and blockchain technology.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices have traded relatively close to $60,000 after falling below that level today. (Photo <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images)</span>Bitcoin prices have experienced some interesting fluctuations today, dropping to their lowest since October and then fighting to recoup their losses. The world’s most prominent digital currency fell to $58,673.84 today, according to <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a>. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading at its lowest since October 28, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. After declining to this recent low, the digital asset enjoyed a modest recovery, climbing to almost $61,400 within a matter of hours. However, bitcoin prices fell back from this level, decreasing to roughly $59,200 this afternoon. At the time of this report, the digital asset was trading closer to $61,000. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining these latest price movements, some analysts spoke to perfectly natural developments like profit taking. “Today’s action reminds us that markets are volatile and that there is always profit-taking and pullbacks,” said Charlie Silver, CEO &amp; Chairman of <a aria-label=Permission.io class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://permission.io/ href=https://permission.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://permission.io/>Permission.io</a>. “Short memories are a liability if you are a market participant,” he stated. “In July BTC hit 30k and has had a 100% rise in 4 months. This kind of appreciation is bound to see a 50% retracement.”Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a aria-label=BitBull Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ href=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/>BitBull Capital</a>, also weighed in. “Bitcoin had surged past its previous high to set a new one recently and new highs are usually followed by retracements as profit taking sets in,” he noted. Further, DiPasquale cited other developments, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of a proposed spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and “a generally over leveraged market” as creating market conditions “conducive for a move down.” Dylan LeClair, head of market research for <a aria-label=Bitcoin Magazine class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ href=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/>Bitcoin Magazine</a>, also spoke to the impact that high use of leverage had on bitcoin’s latest retracement. “The recent market pullback can largely be attributed to excess leverage on the long side with derivative traders speculating on spot Bitcoin price rising,” he stated. “This can be specifically seen in the Binance perpetual swap, which is the most liquid derivative market in the world and is – unsurprisingly - over leveraged on the long side.”<strong>US Infrastructure Bill </strong>Other analysts highlighted the importance of the U.S. infrastructure bill, which was recently signed into law by President Joe Biden. This piece of legislation has generated plenty of headlines in crypto circles for the more stringent regulations it will bring to certain companies doing business in the space. More specifically, some industry participants are worried about the language in the bill, which will provide a broader definition of “brokers” and then require companies meeting these requirements to report cryptocurrency transactions.Andrew Rossow, an internet and technology attorney, commented on this situation. “The spending bill, while primarily in place to address and upgrade the U.S. public works system, also brings new rules for crypto brokers, who are now required to report transactions worth more than $10,000 to the tax authorities,” he noted. “Unfortunately, this would bring tax increases upon digital assets. We may continue to see price fluctuations as service providers may begin to charge higher fees to compensate for the recently assessed tax levies,” said Rossow.He shed further light on the matter, stating that: “Specifically crypto brokers (which is currently vague in its writing) would be required to issue a 1099-like form disclosing their customers. The issue here is the definition of what a ‘broker’ is, which can explain part of the price fluctuation of those market participants who are fearful.”“The bill itself is POWERFUL - more than anyone realizes right now, because it's about to lay the groundwork for better defining what a ‘Crypto broker’ is in our industry - currently the legislation keeps the definition of a ‘broker’ very vague, which has stirred the fear, concern, and reluctance of supporting such a bill,” said Rossow. “Once we know what the precedent will be for what exactly a ‘broker’ is, the industry will have a stronger idea of how bitcoin will continue to be affected for good (versus negative). This bill definitely scares investors and market participants right now, given the courts (digital immigrants) are forced to finally address digital currency.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 6 2022 09:02am ,"Business Trends Graphs and charts 3d imageSo today the cryptobear in me is looking at crashing bitcoin without the shock or surprise many will be experiencing.This is what bitcoin does. It booms and crashes. It could as easily be $20,000 as $80,000 in the next few weeks up to Christmas.Bitcoin and Ethereum are most spectacularly volatile assets. They are trader paradise.Now I’ve written about bitcoin being digital gold for years but it is not exactly like gold, and while it does a better job than gold as a haven asset it isn’t an inflation hedge like gold.Bitcoin and the crypto asset class is not an easy hedge for anything.Certainly it’s an asset for diversification and certainly packs a beta/volatility punch for those wishing to spice up their portfolios with a sprinkle of crazy dust, but using bitcoin as a hedge against a few years of highest inflation is impractical.The idea that we have an inflationary dynamic well under way is a fairly strong thesis and the idea that assets that are hard are a good hedge against that is fair enough, but you can’t expect an asset that can halve and double and perhaps halve again in a single year to be a hedge against that kind of slow chronic process.Again it is a fairly strong hypothesis to believe bitcoin will moon and double, triple, quadruple etc, but that is not a hedge against inflation, that is a one-way bet on asset appreciation. Bitcoin can move in a day what inflation might move in a year, and the level of inflation that would represent would bring wide financial panic.Maybe it’s just semantics, but while you will surely outperform inflation if the bulls are correct, that performance will have little to do with the effect or inflation on the sort of depreciation that fiat is going to undergo in the next few years. If bitcoin was actually to act as an inflation hedge, most holders would be extremely disappointed.While it might take 5 years to cut the value of money in half, anyone who has been watching can see 10%+ being cut off the value of bitcoin in the last 24 hours.So where is bitcoin going now?The bulls will continue to say to the moon and you have to say that bitcoin and crypto in general has been extremely strong, and this chart shows their thinking in a nutshell:The bitcoin chart shows it could go to the moonFor a bear like me the future should look more like this:The bearish view of where bitcoin could goBoth being extrapolations from about a week ago.However gut wrenching today’s action may be it doesn’t leave a bearish chart:A likely scenario for the future of bitcoin Of course, that could all change with bitcoin in the bat of an eye, but the time to get bearish is not during vertical moves but when there is a trend that grinds on down slowly.As a bear I see bitcoin as being fully valued and perhaps starting to get a little stale in the short term. A correction is therefore quite likely.The same reason why bitcoin is not an inflation hedge is the same reason bitcoin is nigh on randomly priced. It can boom or crash at the drop of a hat. The only thing for sure is that if it were to crash heavily, that would be a great time to buy and a crash for this sort of asset is far more than the 25% it is for equities. Think 75%. This may be extremely pessimistic but the point is, if it ever does come back that much it will be a great time to buy, because just as when everyone says it’s going up forever is the top of a market, so when everyone says it’s the end, that’s the time to buy. That day may well come before the next halvening and I’m prepared to wait.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description='&lt;p&gt;I am the CEO of stocks and investment website &lt;a href=www.advfn.com rel=nofollow noopener&gt; ADVFN &lt;/a&gt;.

At the moment, the overall bullish market structure remains largely intact, added Morch. The cryptocurrency fear and greed index has so far failed to react to yesterday’s spill in the sector, ending up at 71, still in greed territory, which bears little resemblance to the sentiment in the markets as of this morning, said Kuptsikevch, warning traders should watch out for a break or a short-term shakeout.The $57,500-$60,000 area focuses on the 50-day moving average and the 61.8% retracement level from the rise since late September. If bitcoin does not get solid buying support in this area, it could open the road down to $52,000.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Newer blockchains, such as ethereum, are quicker, cheaper and able to support a variety of transactions. Bitcoin proponents see the Taproot upgrade as proof bitcoin can improve while at the same time remaining true to its underlying principles of decentralization and immutability.<strong>War wounds: </strong>The upgrade includes so-called Schnorr signatures that allow more complex bitcoin transactions to look like just any other transaction and is the first significant change to bitcoin since the introduction of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in 2017. SegWit, designed to help bitcoin scale, was implemented at the height of the so-called block size wars that saw the bitcoin community riven in two, with one side breaking away to create a payments-focused fork of bitcoin, known as bitcoin cash.<strong>The bottom line:</strong> Don't expect to see NFTs or complicated DeFi protocols on bitcoin just yet, but this successful upgrade shows there is a path to doing more with bitcoin than simply hodling.<strong>Now read this:</strong> <a aria-label=The crypto capital of the world has to be somewhere.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Identifying a threat needle in a haystack.Heavy is the head that wears the crown. As the world’s preeminent digital bearer asset, owning Bitcoin comes with a different set of security risks than owning traditional assets. To develop a personal security plan, you should strive to consider all conceivable threats and prioritize accordingly.Before you can adequately prepare, however, you must first assess the danger. Threat modeling is a process I perform regularly as the co-founder and CTO of a Bitcoin security provider.I recently conducted a <a aria-label=straw poll class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/CasaHODL/status/1454462953240080393 href=https://twitter.com/CasaHODL/status/1454462953240080393 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://twitter.com/CasaHODL/status/1454462953240080393>straw poll</a> that asked “What is the biggest threat to your Bitcoin?” The poll received more than 1,600 votes, and though it is far from scientific, it’s an interesting glimpse into how Bitcoiners assess security threats. In this first edition of Lopp’s Threat Index, I cover each individual threat from both a historical and practical perspective. Consider this a primer for modeling your own unique security risks.Lopp Rank: 1stPoll Rank: 1st (39.8%)Accidental loss is the most pernicious threat to your Bitcoin. In the protocol’s early days, it was very easy to lose Bitcoin, and many people did. It’s estimated that about 4 million Bitcoin have been lost, nearly a fifth of all the Bitcoin <em>that will ever exist</em>.Today, some of that risk has been mitigated with technology, such as <a aria-label=metal seed storage devices class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/ href=https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/>metal seed storage devices</a> and <a aria-label=multisignature class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://blog.keys.casa/bitcoin-101-multi-sig/ href=https://blog.keys.casa/bitcoin-101-multi-sig/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://blog.keys.casa/bitcoin-101-multi-sig/>multisignature</a> functionality. But accidents still happen. Many people don’t actively back up their most important data. If you’re not careful, a forgotten password or misplaced wallet could wipe out your holdings.<strong>How to prepare: </strong>Start by backing up your seed phrase (offline!) or using a multisig arrangement if you have a significant amount of Bitcoin. Once you’ve created and tested your backups, check them at least annually.It’s also important to pay close attention during major life changes, such as moving or switching over to a new phone or computer. These are instances where it makes sense to have extra redundancy in your Bitcoin security plan.Lopp Rank: 2ndPoll Rank: 3rd (19.6%)Digital theft is a continuously evolving threat in Bitcoin security, and it underscores the importance of self-custody. In the early days, exchanges and custodians were major hacking targets because most people left their Bitcoin there.Today, improved cold storage practices by large custodians have shifted the threat of digital attacks to individual account holders. Rather than trying to hack an exchange’s wallet, bad actors deploy sophisticated “spear-phishing” and SIM swapping tactics to compromise the individual’s exchange account and authorize large withdrawals that can’t be clawed back.Social engineering is another common tactic in the digital realm. Scareware / fake airdrops / malicious text messages and emails will try to trick you into entering sensitive information so that attackers can steal your money.<strong>How to prepare:</strong> The first layer of security should always be privacy. Don’t share intimate financial details with others. In the same way, it’s dangerous to go around flashing cash publicly, it’s a bad idea to talk about your Bitcoin. Most people are easy to find.As for social engineering: don’t trust, verify. These threats are nuanced, so exercise caution when browsing the web, reading unsolicited messages, and dealing with third parties in general.Lopp Rank: 3rdPoll Rank: 2nd (27.1%)At this point, government response is a mostly theoretical attack vector, unless you’re a political dissident or operating outside the bounds of your local laws. There have been seizures as the result of criminal investigation, and nations have banned certain activities. However, I’m not aware of any government confiscations of Bitcoin on a widespread basis.Make no mistake: government action is a threat worth considering, especially from a historical point of view. Just look to gold for a comparison. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 <a aria-label=forbidding gold possession class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/04/05/governments-still-heavy-handed-80-years-after-fdrs-gold-confiscation/?sh=2c72d14216a6 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/04/05/governments-still-heavy-handed-80-years-after-fdrs-gold-confiscation/?sh=2c72d14216a6 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/04/05/governments-still-heavy-handed-80-years-after-fdrs-gold-confiscation/?sh=2c72d14216a6>forbidding gold possession</a> above a certain threshold. Prohibition proved ineffective and the rule was repealed in 1974.It’s impractical to enforce an outright ban on owning Bitcoin, but that doesn’t preclude a desperate nation-state from trying. This threat could be a higher priority in the future because if it happens someday, many people will be affected unlike other individualized threats. Government action is like a dormant volcano that could erupt one day. Keep an eye on it.<strong>How to prepare: </strong>If a government were to take action against Bitcoin, they would first need to determine who has it. If you buy Bitcoin from a regulated exchange, it’s safe to assume you’re a known entity. This process can be bypassed by purchasing Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer basis, but that has its own risks, too.If you want to prevent confiscation, make sure you don’t have all your private keys in one place or in a setup that could be physically compromised.Lopp Rank:<strong> </strong>4thPoll Rank:<strong> </strong>4th<strong> </strong>(13.4%)Physical attacks are fairly correlated with price trends. When Bitcoin is on the rise, it makes headlines in the media, which grab criminals’ attention. Physical attacks get significant media exposure, which makes them prominent in the public eye.In reality, <a aria-label=physical attacks are rare class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md href=https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md>physical attacks are rare</a>. Today, most physical attacks target people trading Bitcoin in person, a high-risk situation. Outside these rendezvouses, attackers tend to target public figures and people who flaunt their wealth. A physical attacker’s payday isn’t very high from the average person, so physical attacks are often premeditated to ensure the target is high value.<strong>How to prepare: </strong>If you purchase Bitcoin in person, be sure to properly vet counterparties. Don’t just meet random people in a secluded area. Be careful who you trust and try to not attract unnecessary attention.Many security threats aren’t the result of attack at all. A simple oversight like poor inheritance planning can be just as devastating.There have been numerous cases where families and heirs have been unable to locate or transfer Bitcoin. Usually, this is the result of poor communication. Exceedingly complex security plans can do heirs a disservice.Unlike every other threat on this list, inheritance is a certainty. Bitcoin is designed to last forever. If you believe in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, develop an inheritance plan even if you plan to live for a long time. Your next of kin will thank you.As you evaluate your own unique security risk, try to stay conscious of all threats, not just one. With time and practice, you’ll come to recognize threats that aren’t even on this list. Combine self-custody with self-discipline and your Bitcoin will have better than bank grade security.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;Jameson Lopp&amp;nbsp;is the CTO &amp;amp; cofounder of Casa, a bitcoin storage company.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> ethereum, Binance's BNB, solana, and cardano. </span>The upgrade could be a macro turning point for evolvability and innovation, merging the best of post-SegWit conservatism with the energy of new beginnings, Ninos Mansor, partner at crypto investor Arrington XRP Capital, wrote in <a aria-label=a report class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://arringtonxrpcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/life_after_taproot.pdf href=https://arringtonxrpcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/life_after_taproot.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://arringtonxrpcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/life_after_taproot.pdf>a report</a> out last month.Bitcoin's latest upgrade, which includes so-called Schnorr signatures that allow more complex bitcoin transactions to look like just any other transaction, is the first significant change to the protocol since the introduction of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in 2017. SegWit, designed to help bitcoin scale, was implemented at the height of the so-called block size wars that saw the bitcoin community riven in two, with one side breaking away to create a payments-focused fork of bitcoin, known as bitcoin cash.Four years in the making, Taproot is a non-contentious proposal, which leaves behind the scar tissue of the block wars and shows the market that bitcoin can evolve while still maintaining an ethos of extreme political stability, Mansor wrote. Since 2017, bitcoin has increasingly been seen as a store of value, more comparable to digital gold than a payments network. Mansor believes this could change as bitcoin's network is better able to compete with ethereum, its smaller rivals and even commercial payment networks like Visa and Ripple's XRP. While most of the market has focused on the rapid innovations in ethereum layer two, the climate for bitcoin layer two is evolving extremely quickly, Mansor wrote, referring to projects built on top of existing blockchains that can speed up transactions and reduce costs by moving them off-chain, adding: Bitcoin could theoretically become a Visa competitor, with new products that revitalize bitcoin’s capabilities as a medium of exchange.Ethereum and its major rivals Binance's BNB, solana, and cardano have all seen their prices soar over the last year thanks to booming interest in smart contract, blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—both largely built on top of ethereum's network. Many expect Binance's BNB, solana, and cardano to increasingly steal ethereum DeFi and NFT market share as the rival blockchains battle for dominance.

The price surge we’re seeing in bitcoin this week is about more than increased inflows—it’s the result of a combination of tailwinds that have been building for some time, Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at digital currency prime broker Genesis, wrote in emailed comments. The Taproot upgrade, which enhances bitcoin’s smart contract functionality and transaction privacy, reduces its transaction fees and makes Lightning easier and cheaper to use, all of which will boost bitcoin adoption, added Acheson. What’s more, it serves as a reminder that bitcoin is a new technology and not just a store of value.Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade comes timely as development on the bitcoin blockchain has been accelerating quickly this year, Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer at Bitfinex, wrote in emailed comments.Taproot will deliver more scalability, privacy and smart contract functionality on the bitcoin blockchain and greatly expands upon what has been possible so far. We can expect Taproot to unlock the power of Lightning Network to bring true scalability to the bitcoin blockchain, readying it for use in more complex operations.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Nov 12 2021 12:01pm,"Computer, Bank, Blockchain, Coin, CurrencyThe world’s largest Bitcoin mining computer manufacturer, Bitmain, just unveiled its most powerful machine yet.The new miner, <a aria-label=the Antminer S19XP class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashrateindex.com/blog/bitmains-antminer-s19xp-new-bitcoin-miner href=https://hashrateindex.com/blog/bitmains-antminer-s19xp-new-bitcoin-miner rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://hashrateindex.com/blog/bitmains-antminer-s19xp-new-bitcoin-miner>the Antminer S19XP</a>, was officially announced at the company’s World Digital Mining Summit in Dubai this week. Bitmain’s fresh product offering is the newest addition to the S19 series, which launched in the summer of 2020. The new machine is advertised to be 27% more powerful than <a aria-label=the S19 Pro class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/bitmain-antminer-s19pro-110th href=https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/bitmain-antminer-s19pro-110th rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/bitmain-antminer-s19pro-110th>the S19 Pro</a>, the current flagship of  the S19 series, while being 27% more energy efficient, as well.Bitmain has started taking preorders for the machine with a starting price of $10,500 per unit (which is roughly 10-15% less than other top models), and it estimates that it will begin delivering the first batch sometime in Q3 of next year.When looking at its specifications, the S19XP is a significant improvement on the existing S19 series.The machine’s computing power clocks in at 140 terahashes a second (TH/s), which means it produces 140,000,000,000,000,000 guesses a second to find the next block in the blockchain. (A “hash” is a long alphanumeric number that is used to mine new bitcoin blocks; once the correct hash is produced, a miner claims the next block in the Bitcoin blockchain’s sequence).For reference, the most powerful Antminer currently available, the S19 Pro, produces 110 TH/s, and Bitmain’s 2016 model, the still-widely-deployed <a aria-label=Antminer S9 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/bitmain-antminer-s9-11.5th href=https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/bitmain-antminer-s9-11.5th rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/bitmain-antminer-s9-11.5th>Antminer S9</a>, launched at 11.5 TH/s.Even with this immense hashpower, the machine is also the most energy efficient of any miner on the market, consuming 3010W. This gives it an efficiency of 21.5 watts per terahash (W/TH), whereas the S19 Pro comes in at 29.55 W/TH. This efficiency comes from Bitmain’s use of TSMC’s 5 nanometer (nm) chips in its newest design, whereas previous S19 models used 7nm. Nanometers here refers to the size of the chip. The smaller the chip, the more transistors you can pack into the computer, which results in efficiency gains that reduces power consumption and heat build up..Comparative mining power and hashrate for leading Bitmain minersIf the S19XP was available today, it would be the most profitable machine on the market by far, beating out the revenue produced by the Antminer S19 Pro and <a aria-label=Whatsminer M30S++ class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/whatsminer-m30s-112th href=https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/whatsminer-m30s-112th rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.hashrateindex.com/machines/whatsminer-m30s-112th>Whatsminer M30S++</a>, the current leaders in profitability, by over 25%Given current levels of miner revenue potential (what we in the industry call <a aria-label=hashprice class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashrateindex.com/coins/bitcoin href=https://hashrateindex.com/coins/bitcoin rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://hashrateindex.com/coins/bitcoin>hashprice</a>), the Antminer S19XP would produce $53 a day per deployed unit. See chart below for how this would compare to other leading models.<br/>Daily Revenue Potential of Leading Bitcoin MinersBitmain’s first round of preorders prices the S19XP at $75/TH. So at 140 TH, that means an initial sticker price of $10,500 a rig.Notably, this is significantly less than the ~$105/TH that miners are paying in the ASIC resale market for other top-tier equipment, according to <a aria-label=Hashrate Index’s Rig Price Indices. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashrateindex.com/machines/sha256-rig-index href=https://hashrateindex.com/machines/sha256-rig-index rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://hashrateindex.com/machines/sha256-rig-index>Hashrate Index’s Rig Price Indices.</a>The discount is included to compensate for the fact that these machines will have a lead time from ordering to deployment of anywhere from 7 to 10 months—potentially even longer if chip shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks throttle manufacturing output and delivery schedules.

These machines would be capable of producing 39.2 exahashes a second (that’s 39,200,000,000,000,000,000,000). That’s roughly a 4th of the Bitcoin network’s outstanding hashrate today.Most of these machines won’t be plugged in next year, though. If Bitmain’s production and delivery schedule goes as planned, the first batches will go online towards the end of Q3 and throughout Q4. But when they do come online, they will add heaps of hashrate to Bitcoin’s computing power, <a aria-label=which could easily double next year. class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/03/bitcoin-mining-stocks-in-north-america-surge-as-companies-press-their-advantage/?sh=6b72c3fb7b8f href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/03/bitcoin-mining-stocks-in-north-america-surge-as-companies-press-their-advantage/?sh=6b72c3fb7b8f target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/11/03/bitcoin-mining-stocks-in-north-america-surge-as-companies-press-their-advantage/?sh=6b72c3fb7b8f>which could easily double next year.</a>Mega farms in North America and elsewhere will be the first to secure these machines. Once they come online in vast quantities and Bitcoin’s hashrate rises as a result, the increase in mining difficulty will obsolete older machines (like the S9 for e.g.) that have lesser efficiency and produce fewer hashes.These machines will simply become unprofitable in all places except those with dirt cheap electricity rates. New generation and middle-of-the-road machines will still be viable, but less profitable.Current prices of leading miners<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am the head of content at Luxor Technologies, a full-stack Bitcoin mining pool, where I produce research for the pool's data analytics platform, Hashrate Index.

However, much of the crypto community think there are reasons to be bullish beyond growing Wall Street acceptance of bitcoin. While this recent price rally can be attributed to movements like the approval of the first bitcoin ETF for institutional investors, we can't ignore the impact of significant development and adoption in emerging markets, Ray Youssef, the chief executive of fintech platform Paxful, said in emailed comments. More developers are entering the space to build a DeFi stack on bitcoin, the lightning network is seeing a massive rally with the support of Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, and countries like El Salvador have adopted bitcoin as legal tender.<a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has returned to and surpassed its previous all-time highs over the last month, <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices reached their latest record as numerous tailwinds fueled gains. (Photo Illustration <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> by Mykola Tys/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)</span>Bitcoin prices have reached yet another record, flirting with the $69,000 price level as the digital currency benefits from numerous tailwinds. Around 9:15 a.m. EST, the digital currency rose to $68,990.90, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> shows. Upon attaining this level, it had rallied close to 140% this year, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. After coming close to $69,000, the cryptocurrency fell back, but only slightly, failing to drop below $68,000. Following that very modest decrease, it recovered, trading closer to $68,600 at the time of this writing. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining these most recent gains, market analysts cited several developments, which ranged from anticipation surrounding the upcoming Taproot upgrade to the latest inflation figures and how they might portend a greater interest in bitcoin. A range of factors continue to function as structural tailwinds for Bitcoin’s price,” said Kay Khemani,<strong> </strong>managing director at <a aria-label=Spectre.ai class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://spectre.ai/ href=https://spectre.ai/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://spectre.ai/>Spectre.ai</a>. “These include ongoing ETF approvals, that for now, are limited to just the U.S.; increased clarity on unified and coordinated regulatory reform, which could help govern digital assets, thereby weaving them into the existing financial fabric; and finally, Taproot upgrades that give Bitcoin functional utility within the developer community, all of which provide Bitcoin bears with cause for concern.” Other analysts also spoke to the Taproot upgrade, with Armando Aguilar, vice president of Digital Assets Strategy for <a aria-label=Fundstrat Global Advisors class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://fundstrat.com/ href=https://fundstrat.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://fundstrat.com/>Fundstrat Global Advisors</a>, describing it as bitcoin’s “biggest upgrade in four years.” “Taproot will give greater transaction privacy as well as efficiency,” he stated. “But the biggest upgrade will be that it will unlock the potential for smart contracts.” “Investors have become bullish on the latest upgrade, pushing the digital asset to new ATH in addition to macroeconomic factors,” said Aguilar.Marc Bernegger, a board member of <a aria-label=Crypto Finance Group class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cryptofinance.ch/ href=https://www.cryptofinance.ch/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cryptofinance.ch/>Crypto Finance Group</a>, also weighed in on this matter. “The Taproot upgrade will have a substantial impact on the future growth and usage of Bitcoin and will increase the adoption rate dramatically,” he stated. “This definitely also has an impact on the demand and price of Bitcoin.”Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of the global payment network <a aria-label=Mercuryo class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://mercuryo.io/ href=https://mercuryo.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://mercuryo.io/>Mercuryo</a>, also spoke to the upcoming upgrade, but emphasized the importance of a separate development. “Bitcoin just surged to yet another All-Time High (ATH) just above $68,700 as the anticipation and build-up around Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, scheduled to take place in a few days, soars higher,” he stated. “While the Taproot upgrade marks a major shift in how the Bitcoin network will operate, especially in terms of transaction fees and smart contracts integration, the main forceful driver of the current run is a whole different fundamental.” He next spoke to U.S. inflation figures, which were released today and showed that the the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers <a aria-label=climbed 6.2% class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/cpi/ href=https://www.bls.gov/cpi/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bls.gov/cpi/>climbed 6.2%</a> over the last year. “The inflationary trend is obvious and is bound to continue on its upward surge,” said Kozyakov. “Investors are exploring the options that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, provide as a viable hedge against inflation,” he stated. “The inflationary factor appeals more to a wider class of investors compared to the Taproot Upgrade and is billed to fuel a continuous rise in BTC at least until the end of this year.” Bernegger also spoke to these latest figures. “The publication of the massive US inflation rate today was an additional trigger for the price spike of Bitcoin,” he stated. “More and more investors are worried about a permanent and high inflation cycle and are looking for ways to preserve their assets.” <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

The gains are driven largely by the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, the bellwether cryptocurrency, has rallied by about 23% over the last month and remains up by over 120% from its July lows, trading at levels of almost $68,000 as of Monday. The price of Ethereum has rallied by about 35% over the last month. This is positive for crypto brokerages such as Coinbase, as higher crypto asset prices typically bring more active users onto the platform and drive trading volumes, helping revenues. Now, although Coinbase is expected to see sequential declines in its business for Q3 2021, as it reports quarterly results on Tuesday, investors are looking beyond this, considering the recent surge in the crypto market.So is Coinbase stock a buy at current levels of around $354 per share? Coinbase stock currently trades at just about 28x consensus 2021 earnings, which is not a high valuation for a highly profitable and futuristic stock with solid earnings potential. For perspective, Coinbase’s net margins stood at an incredible 65% over the first half of 2021. However, the crypto market is inherently cyclical and the odds are that we could be approaching a market peak. It’s looking quite likely that the Federal Reserve could raise U.S. interest rates before the end of 2022 due to a strong economic recovery and high inflation. This could put the brakes on the rally for non-productive assets such as crypto, impacting exchanges such as Coinbase. We value Coinbase stock at about $300 per share, marking a discount of about 15% from the current market price.See our analysis on <a aria-label=Coinbase Valuation class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ymvMk9SJ/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ymvMk9SJ/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ymvMk9SJ/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ymvMk9SJ/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110>Coinbase Valuation</strong></a><strong>: Expensive or Cheap? </strong>for more details on Coinbase’s valuation.

The gains are likely driven by the recovery in Bitcoin prices in recent weeks. While the bellwether cryptocurrency saw a big sell-off through the summer, it has rallied by about 6% over the last week and about 24% over the last month, trading at levels of $57,000 as of Monday. Higher crypto prices typically bring more active users onto the Coinbase platform and drive trading volumes, helping Coinbase’s revenues. Coinbase previously guided that its monthly transacting user base could drop to between 5.5 million to 8 million for the full year, down from around 8.8 million in June 2021, and it’s possible that the recent increase in crypto prices could stem this decline to a certain extent.So is the Coinbase stock a buy at current levels of around $256 per share? Coinbase currently trades at just about 21x projected 2021 earnings, which is a reasonable valuation for a futuristic stock with solid earnings potential. For perspective, Coinbase’s net margins stood at an incredible 65% over the first half of 2021. To be sure, investors are pricing in the inherent cyclicality of the crypto business to value Coinbase for the long term, but we still think the stock is worth a look.

While the recent sell-off is driven by macro factors such as rising bond yields and weak U.S. consumer confidence data, and the Chinese central bank’s move to ban all cryptocurrency transactions in the country, Coinbase stock has actually been under pressure for some time now. In fact, the stock remains down by over 30% since it went public in mid-April 2021. The crypto market has faced some softness of late, with the price of bellwether cryptocurrency Bitcoin down about 35% from recent highs. Coinbase also guided that it expects business to trend lower over the second half of 2021, noting that its monthly transacting user base could drop to between 5.5 million to 8 million for the full year, down from around 8.8 million in June 2021.So is the stock a buy at current levels of around $225 per share?

Although the markets are obviously pricing in the inherent cyclicality of Coinbase’s business, we think the stock is still worth a look. Coinbase is a market leader in the cryptocurrency space, which has the potential to be among the most disruptive technologies of our time. The company has built a reputation for transparency, security, and compliance, and this could make it the go-to platform as Bitcoin and other cryptos continue to gain traction. Coinbase is also taking steps to reduce the volatility of its business to an extent, doubling down on areas such as providing blockchain infrastructure and increasing its exposure to institutional customers, who are more steady compared to retail traders. We value the stock at about $295 per share, representing a potential upside of about 30% from the current market price.See our analysis on <a aria-label=Coinbase Valuation class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ISsRbJFb/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ISsRbJFb/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ISsRbJFb/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/no-login-required/ISsRbJFb/Coinbase-COIN-Valuation-Is-COIN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110>Coinbase Valuation</strong></a><strong>: Expensive or Cheap? </strong>for more details on Coinbase’s valuation.

Is The Stock Still A Buy?</strong><a aria-label=Coinbase class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/ href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/>Coinbase</a> published a stronger than expected set of Q2 2021 results, as its monthly transacting users and trading volumes continued to rise, despite the declines in Bitcoin prices through the quarter. However, despite the earnings beat, Coinbase stock remained listless in after-hours trading, considering that the company’s outlook for Q3 and the rest of the year was weak.Revenues expanded 27% sequentially to $2.2 billion, while adjusted EBITDA rose by about 3% to $1.15 billion. Overall trading volumes on the platform stood at $462 billion, up 38% sequentially. Notably, institutional customers were the biggest driver of growth, with institutional trading volumes rising from 47% sequentially to $215 billion. This is a very positive development, in our view, as revenue from institutions is likely to be a little more stable versus retail customers who are likely to scale back during bear markets.Looking ahead, the company expects monthly active users and trading volume to be lower over Q3 compared with Q2, due to the decline in cryptocurrency prices earlier in the quarter. Business overall could also decline over the back half of this year. For perspective, while the company had roughly 8.8 million monthly transacting users at the end of June, it expects average MTUs for this year to come in at between 5.5 million to 8 million for the full year.So, although a decline in business is looking likely for Coinbase in the next couple of quarters, we still think the stock remains slightly undervalued trading at levels of about $265 per share, or just under 12x our projected 2021 revenues for the company. Coinbase is a market leader in the cryptocurrency space, which has the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. The company has built a reputation for transparency, security, and compliance, and this could make it the go-to platform as bitcoin and other cryptos continue to gain traction.

The rally is likely driven by short covering as well as indicators that the U.S. SEC is increasingly open to allowing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, a development that could possibly help to take the crypto to a broader base of investors. We think that the current Bitcoin rally bodes well for <a aria-label=Coinbase class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/ href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/COIN/>Coinbase</a>, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, for a couple of reasons.Coinbase’s active userbase and trading activity is significantly influenced by pricing and volatility of the cryptocurrency prices. The recent rally in Bitcoin, which is seen as the bellwether crypto, should help to get investors engaged in crypto trading once again, potentially driving Coinbase’s revenues. Coinbase’s stock hasn’t really tracked the recent surge in Bitcoin prices giving it some room to run. While the stock is up by about 8% over the last week, it still remains down by about 21% since it was listed publicly in April. We also continue to believe that Coinbase’s valuation is attractive. Considering its current market price of $258 per share, the stock is valued at just about 34x our projected 2021 earnings estimate, despite the fact that we expect sales to rise almost 4x this year. While investors are factoring some amount of cyclicality into Coinbase’s revenues, given the nature of crypto prices, which in turn impact the company’s trading revenues, we still think the stock remains a good value.We value the stock at about $295 per share, which represents a potential upside of about 15%.

Firstly, the price for bellwether cryptocurrency Bitcoin has declined from levels of around $62,000 in mid-April to just about $33,000 as of Wednesday, and this, in turn, is impacting sentiment around Coinbase stock. Secondly, Coinbase went public via a direct listing, that enables early investors to sell shares on the first day of trading without the typical IPO lockup period and this also likely put pressure on the stock. Now, does the recent correction present a good entry-point into Coinbase’s stock? We think it does.Coinbase is the market leader in the cryptocurrency space, which has the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Coinbase has a wide variety of services to retail and institutional customers and has built a reputation for transparency, security, and compliance, and this could make the company the go-to platform as bitcoin and other cryptos continue to gain traction. Moreover, Coinbase isn’t just a futuristic “story” stock. Coinbase is already delivering profits, and they are big. Sales are projected to grow by over 4x to almost $6 billion in 2021, per our estimates, and net profits could approach a whopping $2 billion this year. Although investors should brace for some cyclicality going forward as crypto prices are subject to multi-year cycles (two to four years, per Coinbase), the company is looking to stabilize revenues, doubling down on areas such as providing blockchain infrastructure, via its recent purchase of Bison Trails. Overall, we think the stock looks attractive at current prices of about $225 per share, trading at just about 10x projected 2021 revenues. We value Coinbase at about $295 per share, about 30% ahead of the current market price.

However, cryptocurrencies now appear to be in a bear market. Prices for bellwether cryptocurrency Bitcoin have declined from levels of around $62,000 in mid-April, as Coinbase went public, to just about $35,000 as of Sunday. Although prices have stabilized a bit since they fell to as low as $32,000 last week, the recent sell-off is a reminder that the crypto market is subject to big boom and bust cycles. So how is this likely to impact Coinbase’s performance going forward?Coinbase’s revenues are very sensitive to cryptocurrency pricing, as prices influence the number of monthly transacting users on its platform and the total value of transactions. As prices collapse, users will be less active, while transaction revenue will also decline. For perspective, over the last crypto bear market in 2018 through which Bitcoin prices plunged by over 80%, Coinbase’s MTUs fell by about 70% from 2.7 million in Q1 2018 to just 0.8 million in Q1 2019.<sup> [</sup><a aria-label=1 class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm href=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm><sup data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm>1</sup></a><sup>]</sup> Coinbase’s Trading Volumes also fell from $56 billion in Q1’18 to just $7 billion in Q1’19 - a whopping 87% decline. If the bear market in Bitcoin continues, we could see Coinbase’s revenues and margins contract substantially in the coming quarters.

The stock is now down by over 25% over the last month. So what’s driving the current sell-off?On Monday evening, Coinbase said that it plans to raise about $1.3 billion via a convertible bond sale, a move that could be dilutive to existing shareholders. Investors were also likely surprised by the timing of the issue, considering that Coinbase just went public in mid-April via a direct listing (which doesn’t involve issuing new shares or raising capital), signaling that it didn’t require cash. So the company’s decision to issue bonds a little over a month later is likely raising some questions.More importantly, Bitcoin, the bellwether cryptocurrency, appears to be headed into a bear market. Bitcoin prices are down by over 20% over the last month and remain about 30% off their all-time highs. Coinbase’s revenues are sensitive to cryptocurrency pricing, as prices influence the number of monthly transacting users on its platform and the total value of transactions. If prices continue to trend lower, this could impact Coinbase’s revenue and profitability for this year.

So what’s driving the sell-off?Firstly, Coinbase went public via a direct listing, which enables insiders to sell shares right away without the usual post IPO lockup period that limits the initial supply of shares. This could be putting some pressure on Coinbase’s stock price. We saw a similar trend last year, as well, with the stocks of workplace management software maker Asana and big data player Palantir Technologies, which went public through direct listings. Both companies saw their stocks move sideways or decline for a few months post their IPOs.Secondly, the price of Bitcoin, the bellwether cryptocurrency, has declined by almost 15% since Coinbase went public. Coinbase’s revenues are quite sensitive to cryptocurrency pricing, as prices influence the number of monthly transacting users on the platform and the total value of transactions. If prices continue to trend lower, this could impact Coinbase’s revenue and profitability for this year.Thirdly, there are concerns that Coinbase’s transaction fees - which account for over 80% of its revenues - will face pressure as competition rises. Coinbase charges retail users a spread of about 0.50% for transactions, besides another fee of between 1.5% and 4% depending on how they fund their trades. In comparison, Robinhood offers commission-free investing in cryptocurrency on its app, while PayPal and Square also offer lower fees compared to Coinbase in some scenarios. Moreover, the crypto markets are still in their early stages of development, and it’s likely that many more players will enter the fray and potentially drive down transaction fees and profit margins for Coinbase.Our interactive analysis <a aria-label=Coinbase Revenues: How Does COIN Make Money? class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110>Coinbase Revenues: How Does COIN Make Money?</strong></a> provides an overview of Coinbase’s business model and key revenue streams.<strong>[4/23/2021] Can Coinbase Handle A Crypto Bear Market</strong>Coinbase stock has had a rocky ride since it went public last week. While the stock opened at roughly $328 per share on listing day, it has trended lower since, to about $293 per share as of yesterday. Although the decline is partly driven by the fact that the company went with a direct listing, enabling insiders to sell shares right away without the usual post IPO lockup period, the cryptocurrencies that Coinbase’s platform enables customers to buy and sell have also corrected. For example, the price of Bitcoin - the largest crypto asset by market cap - has declined by almost 20% since Coinbase went public. So can Coinbase’s stock hold up through a potential crypto bear market?About 90% of Coinbase’s revenues come from transaction revenues, which are very sensitive to the pricing trend for cryptocurrencies (particularly for bellwether Bitcoin). This, in turn, influences the number of monthly transacting users on the platform and the total value of transactions. As Bitcoin prices roughly doubled over Q1, the company saw a quarterly trading volume surge to about $335 billion - that’s higher than the trading volumes for the full years 2019 and 2020 combined. Now, if prices decline, MTUs and transaction volumes on the platform will likely decline sharply, hurting Coinbase.Bitcoin prices are being impacted by a couple of factors. Firstly, with Covid-19 vaccinations picking up in the U.S. and the economy opening up further, investors could be moving funds away from somewhat speculative cryptos to real economy assets. Moreover, there have been reports that the Biden Administration is looking to double the capital gains tax on the wealthiest Americans to 39.6% from the current 20%, and this has also likely hurt cryptocurrencies, which have rallied big over the last year. That said, we think that the inherent cyclicality in crypto prices and transaction revenues is priced into Coinbase stock at current levels. The stock trades at just about 11x forward revenues, despite the fact that revenue growth stood at 139% last year and is poised to accelerate further this year.Our interactive analysis <a aria-label=Coinbase Revenues: How Does COIN Make Money? class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 href=https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/IQwH5Bvj/Coinbase-Revenues-How-Does-COIN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis211110>Coinbase Revenues: How Does COIN Make Money?</strong></a> provides an overview of Coinbase’s business model and key revenue streams.<strong>[4/13/2021] How Does Coinbase Make Money?</strong>Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is expected to go public on April 14, via a direct listing on the Nasdaq exchange with the ticker COIN.

Parts of the analysis are summarized below.<strong>Coinbase’s Business Model</strong>Coinbase’s platform enables retail and institutional customers to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company primarily reaches customers via its Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Coinbase Wallet apps and its websites. Coinbase had a total of about 56 million retail users as of Q1 2021. Roughly 90% of the company’s revenues (as of 2020) came from the transaction fees from trading and via services such as storage and analytics. Coinbase charges its customers’ transaction fees (estimated at about 0.5%) based on the volumes that they trade, with larger trades seeing lower fees. The company’s commissions are higher than traditional exchanges, given the higher transaction costs for Bitcoin and other cryptos. About 10% of the company’s revenues come from sales of its own crypto assets to customers.<br/><strong>How Have Revenues Trended?</strong>The company’s transaction revenues are heavily dependent on the pricing trend for cryptocurrencies (particularly for bellwether Bitcoin). This, in turn, influences the number of monthly transacting users on the platform and the total value of transactions. Higher price volatility for crypto assets also typically helps revenues. Total revenue rose from around $534 million in 2019 to $1.28 billion in 2020, as the company’s monthly transacting users rose from about 1 million to about 2.8 million over the period, with total trading volumes rising from around $80 billion to $193 billion. The company had a stellar Q1 2021, with estimated Revenues growing to $1.8 billion, with trading volume for the quarter rising to $335 billion as the price of Bitcoin almost doubled year-to-date, causing the number of active monthly traders to surge from 2.8 million at the end of last year to 6.1 million in Q1. That said, it’s probably unrealistic to expect the company to maintain its Q1 growth rates for the rest of 2021, given the cyclical nature of the crypto market. Moreover, rising bond yields and a stellar 8x run in Bitcoin prices make the crypto market quite vulnerable to a correction in the near term.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is displayed in front of the Bitcoin course's graph on June 25, 2019 in Paris, France. </span>Everyone was stunned when the new mayor of New York City Eric Adams <a aria-label=announced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/new-york-mayor-elect-eric-adams-to-take-first-3-paychecks-in-bitcoin.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/new-york-mayor-elect-eric-adams-to-take-first-3-paychecks-in-bitcoin.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/new-york-mayor-elect-eric-adams-to-take-first-3-paychecks-in-bitcoin.html>announced</a> he was planning to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that’s been dominating the financial headlines for the past year. The mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, had already announced he would accept his first paycheck 100% in Bitcoin. The mayoral announcements are still more signs that cryptocurrencies are no longer esoteric investments for the super-rich (or super-crooks) but have entered the financial mainstream. Back in May <a aria-label=Deutsche Bank pronounced class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://decrypt.co/39425/bitcoin-is-3rd-largest-world-currency href=https://decrypt.co/39425/bitcoin-is-3rd-largest-world-currency rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://decrypt.co/39425/bitcoin-is-3rd-largest-world-currency>Deutsche Bank pronounced</a> Bitcoin the third biggest world currency in terms of circulation. Only the euro and the U.S. dollar are bigger. Mayor Adams himself says he intends to make New York City “the center of the cryptocurrency industry.” Of course, the history of markets teaches us that what goes up must eventually come down—especially a commodity like crypto, whose rise has been fueled as much by media hype as by financial realities. Whether the current crypto boom turns out to be a crypto bubble, is impossible to say. What Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do have going for them are two virtues.The first is that they are <em>not </em>state-denominated currencies, whose heads around the world have turned out to be inept or corrupt or both.  The other is cryptocurrency’s reliance on blockchain, or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), to protect and authenticate its transactions. The on-going ledger of cryptocurrency transactions is never stored in any single location, which means no centralized version exists for a hacker to corrupt. Since the data is hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, it’s accessible to anyone on the internet. But it’s also protected because after every transaction within the shared ledger; and once all the ledgers match for every computer in the network; the transaction is encrypted with the rest in what’s known as a block. The new block is then added to existing previous blocks to form a chain of blocks—hence the term blockchain.All in all, blockchain is a built-in security system that prohibits a hacker or attacker from forcing open the distributed ledger without everyone knowing it.As tech guru George Gilder argues in his book, <em>Life After Google</em>, using blockchain to share but also protect data poses a greater threat to Big Tech dominance of the internet than any government regulation or legislation—just as cryptocurrencies pose a useful challenge to the elites who control our state-denominated currencies.But as always there’s a catch. Blockchain is an adequate safeguard against existing cyber threats, but not against the future one posed by large-scale quantum computers. As I mentioned in a previous column, blockchain’s encryption is based on Elliptical Curve Cryptography, which will be vulnerable to factorization by quantum computers that can decrypt the complex algorithms used by asymmetric encryption systems to secure almost all electronic data, including blockchain. The quantum attacker will simply look like another member of the shared ledger, in a cyber assault that will be undetectable and persistent. CHICAGO, IL - DECEMBER 19: Traders trade VIX contracts at the Cboe Global Markets exchange <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> (previously referred to as CBOE Holdings, Inc.) on December 19, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. Last week the exchange became the first in the Unites States to begin trading Bitcoin futures. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</span>How vulnerable will cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin be? Consider: in 2020 the total market cap of cryptocurrencies was $330 billion. Today it is approaching $2 trillion. Institutional investors account for 63% of trading in cryptos, compared to just 10% in 2017, which means a collapse of crypto value is bound to ripple through balance sheets all around Wall Street-and around the world.Our most recent study conducted here at the Quantum Alliance Initiative done in conjunction with the econometric firm Oxford Economics indicates that a quantum attack on crypto precipitating a 99.2% collapse of value, would inflict $1.865 Trillion in immediate losses to owners, with nearly $1.5 trillion in indirect losses to the whole economy due to that collapse. All in all, we are looking at a $3.3 trillion blow to the U.S. economy.That’s a calculation based on crypto’s current value. By the time a large-scale quantum computer emerges, by 2030 or so, cryptocurrencies will be even more imbedded in the global financial system—and the losses even greater.Fortunately, there’s a solution. The most immediate is post-quantum cryptography, i.e., deploying algorithm-based encryption that is impenetrable to future quantum attack but also to classical attack right now. Crypto exchanges have already drawn highly damaging attacks, like the one in 2018 on Bithumb, the South Korean crypto-currency exchange, which cost $30 million, or the <a aria-label=assault on Poly Network class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-platform-poly-network-says-hacked-funds-returned-2021-08-23/ href=https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-platform-poly-network-says-hacked-funds-returned-2021-08-23/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-platform-poly-network-says-hacked-funds-returned-2021-08-23/>assault on Poly Network</a> this past August in which cyber thieves stole more than $600 million.   BEIJING, Dec. 4, 2020 — A research team including renowned Chinese quantum physicist Pan Jianwei on <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

Make no mistake; regardless of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s ups and downs in the current markets—even if a Bitcoin bubble bursts—crypto currencies are here to stay. Quantum-safe solutions can make sure they are stable and secure for a long time to come.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute,&amp;nbsp; Director of the Quantum Alliance Initiative, and co-author of  “Risking Apocalypse: Quantum Computers and the U.S. Power Grid&quot; (Hudson Institute, December, 2021).

Very tough to predict when this cycle will end. My take is mid-next year.The ethereum price has leaped over the last year amid a surge of interest in blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—both largely built on top of ethereum's network. Many in the crypto community have previously predicted ethereum could eventually overtake bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency, with DeFi—the idea that traditional financial services could be replaced by blockchain-based protocols—and NFTs—using crypto technology to tokenize all manner of digital media and assets—<a aria-label=helping to drive ethereum adoption and, in turn, the price of its ether tokens class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/10/30/1-trillion-crypto-price-boom-bitcoin-braced-for-further-supply-shocks-as-ethereum-suddenly-surges/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/10/30/1-trillion-crypto-price-boom-bitcoin-braced-for-further-supply-shocks-as-ethereum-suddenly-surges/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/10/30/1-trillion-crypto-price-boom-bitcoin-braced-for-further-supply-shocks-as-ethereum-suddenly-surges/>helping to drive ethereum adoption and, in turn, the price of its ether tokens</a>.Ethereum is trying to power the rails of all of global finance in the future, and that is a much bigger market, if it does succeed, Rai said. If it does succeed, and if the thesis plays out, then the market value is going to capture trillions of dollars in global activity, and that's a much bigger market than (what) bitcoin's going up (toward).Rai is, however, still bullish on the bitcoin price, <a aria-label=echoing others who have said bitcoin could replace gold as the world's de facto store of value and hedge against inflation class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/10/02/billionaire-spac-king-reveals-his-huge-bitcoin-bet-and-predicts-the-bitcoin-price-will-climb-as-it-replaces-gold/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/10/02/billionaire-spac-king-reveals-his-huge-bitcoin-bet-and-predicts-the-bitcoin-price-will-climb-as-it-replaces-gold/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/10/02/billionaire-spac-king-reveals-his-huge-bitcoin-bet-and-predicts-the-bitcoin-price-will-climb-as-it-replaces-gold/>echoing others who have said bitcoin could replace gold as the world's de facto store of value and hedge against inflation</a>. Bitcoin is a store of value, it's digital gold, said Rai. And so its market cap, at most, is going to be somewhere around gold—maybe larger, because it has some properties that are better than gold. But that's roughly the benchmark you're going to use to cap its market size.The market capitalization of gold is currently put at around $11.6 trillion, with bitcoin at $1.3 trillion and ethereum at just $570 billion. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The ethereum price has added almost 1,000% over the last 12 months, surging as apps are built on its <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

The partnership intends to introduce cryptocurrency-linked credit, debit and prepaid cards for both individuals and businesses across Asia Pacific. Cardholders will be able to instantly convert bitcoin and other digital currencies into fiat currencies, which can then be spent online or offline with any of the merchants that accept Mastercard payments. The collaboration comes as interest in cryptocurrencies soars to an all-time high in Asia Pacific, Mastercard said in a statement. The U.S. payment behemoth discovered in its latest survey that 45% of consumers in the region are considering using the digital coins within the next year, higher than the global average of 40%. “In collaboration with these partners that adhere to the same core principles that Mastercard does—that any digital currency must offer stability, regulatory compliance and consumer protection—Mastercard is expanding what’s possible with cryptocurrencies to give people even greater choice and flexibility in how they pay,” said Rama Sridhar, Mastercard’s executive vice president who oversees digital partnerships in Asia Pacific, in the statement.Mastercard and Visa have been launching cryptocurrency payment services. Mastercard is bolstering it services as its main rival Visa also seeks to grab a dominant share of the emerging cryptocurrency payment market. Last month, Mastercard announced it had teamed up with New York-listed Bakkt, a digital asset platform spun off by Intercontinental Exchange. The partnership promises to allow U.S. banks and merchants on Mastercard’s payment network to offer crypto-related services, such as providing customers with bitcoin as rewards. In April, Mastercard joined hands with Gemini, the crypto exchange backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, to launch credit cards in the U.S. The move came just a month after trading platform Crypto.com announced its partnership with Visa to roll out a similar service.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am the reporter and multimedia producer for Forbes Asia, based in Hong Kong.

Yes, the impact of Section 6050I has been underexplored. No, you don’t need to call your reps. The political reality is: it’s out of our hands now. The new legislation may not bode well for the crypto industry but notes that there are still significant details that haven’t been worked out yet. Importantly, nothing will happen right away.

Helping you understand the world of bitcoin and crypto, every weekday</strong>The bitcoin price has surged through 2021 but much of the crypto market's gains have come from <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> ethereum, Binance's BNB, cardano, solana, and XRP. </span>To do that, you need the spot ETF, said Saylor, the chief executive of business intelligence software company MicroStrategy, speaking this week at <a aria-label=Bloomberg's Financial Innovation Summit class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/bitcoin-bulls-see-trillions-of-inflows-when-etf-wins-approval href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/bitcoin-bulls-see-trillions-of-inflows-when-etf-wins-approval rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/bitcoin-bulls-see-trillions-of-inflows-when-etf-wins-approval><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/bitcoin-bulls-see-trillions-of-inflows-when-etf-wins-approval>Bloomberg</em>'s Financial Innovation Summit</a>. And once these spot ETFs roll, I think you’ll see billions, then tens of billions, then hundreds of billions, then trillions of dollars flow into them.Over the last year, Saylor has pivoted Microstrategy to a bitcoin acquisition vehicle, buying more than 110,000 bitcoins. The value of the company's bitcoin holdings is around $7 billion, making up almost all of MicroStrategy’s $8 billion market capitalization.Saylor said he expects a U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETF would act as an institutional on-ramp for investors who want bitcoin exposure, adding he'll continue buying bitcoin via MicroStrategy. Such funds are already live in other countries, including Canada. The launch of two U.S. bitcoin futures ETFs in October generated huge media attention, with the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF accumulating more than $1 billion in assets in mere days. However, some, including general partner at Castle Island Ventures Nic Carter, have called futures-based ETFs inferior as they don't give direct exposure to the underlying asset. Carter, speaking alongside Saylor, said a spot bitcoin ETF would be the hottest commodity ETF launch of all time.The right answer is: let investors buy a trillion dollars worth of bitcoin via an ETF because the ETFs plug into the existing security structure, the existing prime brokerages, the existing collateral packages, said Saylor. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has risen more than 300% over the last 12 months, making bitcoin a $1 trillion <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

While bitcoin has lost ground this week, ethereum has added almost 5%, with its too biggest rivals, Binance's BNB and solana, both surging by around 20%. Intraday volatility is completely normal after such a bullish month, but the higher time frame is looking solid for now, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Vienna-based bitcoin and crypto trading platform Bitpanda, said in emailed comments. The crypto market is more integrated into the world economy every day which only shows how important it is for bigger institutions but on the other hand, is also under pressure from macro events.A melt-up in bitcoin and ethereum into year-end is likelier than retracement, we believe, after 2021 corrections cleansed speculative positions, and with increasing demand and adoption, and declining supply, sustaining a bull market, Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone wrote in his latest market <a aria-label=report class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://assets.bbhub.io/promo/sites/12/1465773_Crypto-November2021Outlook.pdf?link=button-body href=https://assets.bbhub.io/promo/sites/12/1465773_Crypto-November2021Outlook.pdf?link=button-body rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://assets.bbhub.io/promo/sites/12/1465773_Crypto-November2021Outlook.pdf?link=button-body>report</a>, pointing to a tidal wave of U.S. ETFs.The startup of U.S. ETFs and the fact that cryptos counter China bans limit downside risks.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

During an online briefing on Thursday, Bang said the new venture intends to sell digital photo cards of Hybe’s artists that will include moving images and sounds.Hybe also announced the same day in a company filing that it’s planning to acquire a 2.5% stake in Dunamu, which runs Korean crypto trading platform Upbit, for nearly 500 billion won ($422 million). The entertainment giant will also issue 2.3 million shares at about 700 billion won to Dunamu, according to a separate filing. NFTs are virtual assets stored on the blockchain that authenticate the ownership of objects such as photos, artwork, music and in-game items. The digital photo cards are similar to the physical ones, which are often produced in limited quantities. It is unclear when Hybe and Dunamu will roll out the virtual trading cards. But the entertainment agency said the products will be available for collection, exchange and display on platforms such as its online fan community. “We are working with Dunamu to create a way to expand the fan experience,” said Bang, the chairman of Hybe, in the online briefing. “We will bring together the capabilities both companies have built up so far to introduce a new and exciting innovation to the global music and fintech industries.”Bang Si-hyuk, founder and chairman of Hybe. Hybe has become one of Korea’s leading entertainment firms thanks to its boy band BTS, which has etched its name into the history books with a string of chart-topping international hits. The success of the K-pop group has propelled its mastermind behind, Bang Si-hyuk, into the world’s billionaire ranks with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion. Meanwhile, Dunamu’s digital asset exchange Upbit is one of the four players that are allowed to continue operations following South Korea’s crackdown that wound up nearly 40 other crypto trading platforms. Upbit is the biggest crypto exchange in the East Asian nation with a market share that reportedly accounted for about 80%. Its wide user base and high trading volume has helped Dunamu attract investments from the likes of Korean internet behemoth Kakao, which was founded by billionaire <a aria-label=Kim Beom-su class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/profile/kim-beom-su/?sh=49aff9a4dd6d href=https://www.forbes.com/profile/kim-beom-su/?sh=49aff9a4dd6d target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/profile/kim-beom-su/?sh=49aff9a4dd6d>Kim Beom-su</a>. The collaboration between Hybe and Dunamu enables BTS to become the latest celebrities to jump on the rapidly growing NFT bandwagon. The nascent virtual space has seen its trading volume skyrocket more than 700% to $10.7 billion in the third quarter from the previous one, according to analytics firm DappRadar. Celebrities like American rapper Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan, as well as sports stars like Lionel Messi, have also rolled out their own NFT collections. However, the heated market has drawn skepticism with experts warning it is more a hype than a lasting investment asset class.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am the reporter and multimedia producer for Forbes Asia, based in Hong Kong.

Almost overnight, the criticism that “China controls Bitcoin” became moot, as the historical epicenter of Bitcoin mining went dark and its professionals packed up their machines to move elsewhere. In the subsequent fallout, North America—particularly, the United States—emerged as the dominant mining hub around the world. Furthermore, mining machine preorders and hashrate projects for 2022 indicate <strong>that this won’t change anytime soon. </strong>(<a aria-label=subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset &amp; Blockchain Advisor and discover crypto blockbusters poised for 1,000% gains class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex&amp;sh=35557ecedec8 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex&amp;sh=35557ecedec8 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex&amp;sh=35557ecedec8>subscribe now to <em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex&amp;sh=35557ecedec8>Forbes'</em> CryptoAsset &amp; Blockchain Advisor and discover crypto blockbusters poised for 1,000% gains</a>)Some models show that the United States alone has already captured 35% of the network’s hashrate. Though <a aria-label=this data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://cbeci.org/mining_map href=https://cbeci.org/mining_map rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://cbeci.org/mining_map>this data</a> from Cambridge’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index is imperfect; it leans on IP address data, which can be unreliable due to VPNs and other IP-scrambling technologies, and it is incomplete as it only draws from four Bitcoin mining pools, it’s likely not far off the mark. <em>At Luxor Technologies, we estimate that the United States currently runs 40% of the network hashrate.</em>The ban kickstarted the largest restructuring of “hashrate” since Bitcoin’s inception (hashrate is the industry term for how much computing power is employed at a given time to secure the Bitcoin network). With more than half of Bitcoin’s hashrate displaced from China, the second half of 2021 has been a lucrative time for plugged-in miners. <strong>None more so than </strong><a aria-label=North America’s top class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashrateindex.com/blog/public-miners-record-q3-2021 href=https://hashrateindex.com/blog/public-miners-record-q3-2021 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://hashrateindex.com/blog/public-miners-record-q3-2021><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashrateindex.com/blog/public-miners-record-q3-2021>North America’s top</strong></a><strong>, publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies. </strong>The top six by market capitalization, for example, mined 79% more bitcoin in Q3 than they did in Q2 and 155% more than they mined in Q1. With competition clipped by China’s mining ban, they are producing more blocks than they otherwise would have if Chinese miners, which used to represent anywhere from 50-60% of the network, remained online. These miners also turned on new machines over Q3, expanding their hashrate.And there’s more coming. Thanks to a plethora of financing options made more readily available with Bitcoin’s growing popularity, these public companies are raising more money than ever before to expand their operations. They’ll be using this money to purchase news machines and build out infrastructure which will cement North America as the dominant hashrate hub in the years to come.China historically held an unshakeable foothold as the top mining destination in the world. Not only did the leading mining rig manufacturers rise to dominance in the country thanks to their proximity to manufacturers of the silicon chips that the specialized machines need to function, but China’s hydro-rich Szechuan region and copious coal deposits in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia supplied miners with dirt cheap energy, making mining in the country incredibly lucrative. Juggernaut as it was, the CCP’s mandates completely dismantled the once booming bitcoin mining industry in China. When the crackdown began fracturing operations, Bitcoin’s hashrate crumbled, falling by over 50% from its peak of roughly 190 exahashes a second (EH/s) in May to a low of 69 EH/s in late June. (“Exa” is a numeric that denominates 1 quintillion, and hashrate is a measure of how many “hashes” (i.e. guesses to find the next block in the chain); so 190 exahashes per second means miners collectively are making 190,000,000,000,000,000,000 guesses a second to mine the next block).Bitcoin's hashrate cratered with the China ban, but it is recovering thanks to North American minersWith so much hashrate turned off, <a aria-label=Bitcoin’s difficulty class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/08/26/chinese-bitcoin-miners-come-back-online-ending-brief-us-bonanza/?sh=7da0bb7a61ae href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/08/26/chinese-bitcoin-miners-come-back-online-ending-brief-us-bonanza/?sh=7da0bb7a61ae target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2021/08/26/chinese-bitcoin-miners-come-back-online-ending-brief-us-bonanza/?sh=7da0bb7a61ae>Bitcoin’s difficulty</a> lowered to make it easier to mine. Difficulty is an internal score that is algorithmically adjusted roughly every two weeks to make sure Bitcoin’s blocks are mined in target with a 10 minute average; if hashrate increases during a difficulty period, the difficulty raises, and if hashrate decreases, then difficulty decreases.Of course, hashrate bounced back as fast-moving Chinese miners turned on rigs elsewhere and mega-farms in North America and elsewhere turned on new machines of their own. <strong>In fact, bitcoin’s difficulty has increased 8 times in a row, the longest succession of upwards adjustments since the first half of 2018.</strong><em>NOTE: <u>Some sources have reported that Bitcoin’s hashrate has already reclaimed the highs it set earlier this year, but this is not accurate. </u>The only way to measure real-time hashrate is to calculate it by factoring both the number of blocks produced during a given time frame and the current mining difficulty (a metric that dictates how difficult it is for miners to mine blocks). The sources claiming that hashrate has rebounded to pre-China ban highs relied on 1-day estimates, which can be skewed if blocks come out faster or slower than usual; a more accurate measurement looks at the moving average across one or two weeks.</em><strong>More Bitcoin = More Money For Miners</strong>But if we look at miner profitability in BTC terms (<a aria-label=what we call hashprice class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashrateindex.com/coins/bitcoin href=https://hashrateindex.com/coins/bitcoin rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://hashrateindex.com/coins/bitcoin>what we call hashprice</a>), we can see that Q3 was a particularly lucrative time for miners compared to Q2. As you can see in the first chart there is a clear inverted correlation between mining difficulty and hashprice. Looking further down at the Coinmetrics chart, daily mining revenue in USD has been moving up in sync with the hashprice thanks to Bitcoin’s rally from $30,000 to its new all-time high of $66,500.Bitcoin Mining Difficulty vs. Hashprice in BTC<br/>Bitcoin mining revenue has surged along with its price recovery<em>Daily miner revenue in USD YTD (Source: CoinMetrics)</em>All of this also lead to impressive gains for the stocks of <a aria-label=these publicly-traded mining companies class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/all href=https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/all rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/all>these publicly-traded mining companies</a>, which have provided a 217% return on average. In comparison, bitcoin has <em>only </em>appreciated 97% this year. For further comparison, the <a aria-label=Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto and Mining Semiconductor ETF (RIGZ) class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://viridifunds.com/rigz-etf/ href=https://viridifunds.com/rigz-etf/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://viridifunds.com/rigz-etf/>Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto and Mining Semiconductor ETF (RIGZ)</a> is up 76% since it launched in late July.North American miners have been rapidly expanding operations this year, and they have no intention of letting off the gas pedal anytime soon.Looking at publicly-available data from SEC filings and investor presentations, many of the top publicly traded bitcoin mining companies in North America expect to dramatically increase their hashrate under management in 2022. Current and Forecasted Hashrate of Leading North American MinersThe above companies are forecasted to increase their collective hashrate by 277% from 17.83 EH/s to 67.34 EH/s. This growth will come from new generation equipment that the miners have pre-ordered and which are scheduled for delivery between now and the latter end of 2022.Bitcoin Marketcap Divided by Current and 2022 Estimated HashrateAs Bitcoin and bitcoin mining are becoming more institutionalized and they are also becoming accepted in mainstream financial circles, as evidenced by the fact that Blackrock, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, Susquehanna, and many other Wall Street heavyweights hold shares of top mining companies (though often as a result of maintaining mutual funds tracking the price of indices such as the Russell 2000 that include such stocks).I expect these companies to continue trading as a Bitcoin proxy for investors who want exposure without owning the asset outright. The mining companies, especially those with large bitcoin treasuries, have played a de-facto role as a bitcoin fund of sorts; Hut 8, for example, holds 4,724 BTC on its balance sheet, and even though its total hashrate is on par with Bitfarms (which holds 2,300 BTC at a ~$900 million marketcap), Hut 8’s ~$2.1 billion marketcap is closure to Riot (which holds 3,534 BTC at $2.8 billion marketcap but which has almost twice as much hashrate as Hut 8).Additionally, these stocks are unlikely to be impacted much by the new Bitcoin futures ETFs that were just launched. The restrictive nature of these products, overhead that comes with rolling over monthly contracts, and expense ratios make them an imperfect competitor to Bitcoin or its associated mining stocks. In fact, you can see in the chart below that they have largely outperformed the first two ETFs (ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which have trailed Bitcoin since inception.Top bitcoin mining stocks are outperforming the new ETFsEven when spot market ETFs for Bitcoin get approved, investors will no doubt continue to look at these stocks as roundabout investment vehicles for Bitcoin itself, and much in the same way gold miners trend up and down with gold, they will track Bitcoin’s price.

We are dealing with a bullish consolidation before another assault on bitcoin, which promises to make the year-end an extravaganza for the first cryptocurrency with a run to new all-time highs, Alex Kuptsikevch, senior financial analyst at FxPro, said in emailed comments, giving bitcoin a price target of just above $90K, where [bitcoin] could be this month.Alongside bitcoin's rally, ethereum has also charged higher, surging amid widespread adoption of ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) and the ongoing craze for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). DeFi—the idea that much of traditional finance can be recreated on the blockchain without the need for banks—and NFTs—a way to tokenize digital media and assets on the blockchain—have found huge new markets over the last year as people flock to digital assets.Ethereum's growing list of use-cases, combined with a hotly-anticipated upgrade that is reducing supply and that developers hope will improve efficiency and scalability, has sparked predictions it will continue to outperform bitcoin.

Mana is now ranked as the 44th most valuable cryptocurrency on CoinGecko's top 100 list of cryptocurrencies.

To get an idea of how far off systemic adoption is in the West, contrast this figure with the fact that <em>less than 10%</em> of respondents professed owning crypto in the UK and US.The situation is changing in a hurry, however. Last week we saw the first Bitcoin ETF launched by ProShares and new futures-based ETF funds can be expected from at least <a aria-label=Invesco, VanEck, Valkyrie Digital Assets and Galaxy Digital. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/articles/money-managers-race-to-launch-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-after-sec-signal-11629451802 href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/money-managers-race-to-launch-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-after-sec-signal-11629451802 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.wsj.com/articles/money-managers-race-to-launch-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-after-sec-signal-11629451802>Invesco, VanEck, Valkyrie Digital Assets and Galaxy Digital.</a> At the same time, countries like El Salvador have made Bitcoin legal tender and more than 80% of central banks worldwide are <a aria-label=actively engaged with digital currencies class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.arabianbusiness.com/466684-why-cryptocurrency-as-an-asset-class-has-staying-power-but-payment-value-is-tenuous href=https://www.arabianbusiness.com/466684-why-cryptocurrency-as-an-asset-class-has-staying-power-but-payment-value-is-tenuous rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.arabianbusiness.com/466684-why-cryptocurrency-as-an-asset-class-has-staying-power-but-payment-value-is-tenuous>actively engaged with digital currencies</a>. On the consumer side of things Robinhood has already made crypto-investing frictionless and payment processors like Venmo are joining the party and both Google and Facebook have partially lifted their banhammers off of crypto ads over the past few months. What we are witnessing is rapid-paced <em>kosherization </em>of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and having BTC embedded deeper into our financial systems will have a larger impact than many of us realize. Most importantly, we can expect to see continued growth for demand in Bitcoin across all facets of life ranging from direct payments to institutional investor portfolios, all of which will conspire to keep satoshis on an upward trajectory for years to come. A few years ago Charlie Munger slammed Bitcoin as ‘worthless, artificial gold’ and if you drop the first adjective Charlie would be right on the money. Just like gold, Bitcoin provides a strong safetynet against inflation, global turmoil and any other shenanigans the market can throw out at an investor. In fact, bitcoin and it's crypto-brethren have succeeded in straddling the fine line between speculation, gambling and non-traditional diversification far more successfully than gold ever could. For example, during the <a aria-label=2012–2020 period class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.etftrends.com/tactical-allocation-channel/bitcoins-correlation-to-markets-hits-a-record-in-2020/ href=https://www.etftrends.com/tactical-allocation-channel/bitcoins-correlation-to-markets-hits-a-record-in-2020/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.etftrends.com/tactical-allocation-channel/bitcoins-correlation-to-markets-hits-a-record-in-2020/>2012–2020 period</a>, Bitcoin’s correlation with S&amp;P 500, bonds, U.S. real estate, oil and emerging market currencies ranged from -0.1 to 0.03, making it an ideal tool for adding diversity to almost any portfolio. All in all, Bitcoin beats gold handily when it comes to correlations with other defensive assets like bonds — rather well done for a worthless and artificial variant, don’t you think. The past years have given us a taste of how our future will most likely be pockmarked by geopolitical insecurity and worsening ravages of climate change and manmade disasters. In an increasingly unstable context, Bitcoin’s unique mix of defensive prowess and speculative appeal make it more future-proof than many other asset classes today, paving the way 100k and beyond. As of today, approximately 18.4 million Bitcoins out of a total of 21 million have been mined. Of these, experts estimate that 10–30% are out-of-market due to lost passwords, hardware crashes and the like.From a systems-integrity perspective, the upcoming halvenings and eventual end of rewards-per-block is a non-event. Around the year 2140 when this is expected to happen, miners will continue running the networks (ideally on renewable energy) with transaction fees to incentivize their efforts. The same cannot be said for the nominal price of Bitcoin, however. As anyone with a macroeconomics 1.01 course under their belt will tell you, a decrease in supply matched with a growth in demand will lead to an inevitable increase in price. And demand is certain to grow. Even if we put systemic adoption and hedging matters aside, there are numerous untapped sources of demand ripe for picking. One particularly potent source is retail and consumer transactions, which have lagged behind largely due to a lack of institutional backing. In the first half of 2021, Visa (and its partners BlocFi, Circle and Coinbase) had more than <a aria-label=one billion dollars flow through their crypto-linked cards class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/08/09/visa-mastercard-crypto-credit-and-debit-cards-should-you-get-one.html href=https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/08/09/visa-mastercard-crypto-credit-and-debit-cards-should-you-get-one.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/08/09/visa-mastercard-crypto-credit-and-debit-cards-should-you-get-one.html>one billion dollars flow through their crypto-linked cards</a>. MasterCard is also putting its bets on crypto, and we can expect its Bitcoin-linked card to become a consumer staple in the coming years. All in all, there is good reason to believe that 60k won’t be the end of the bull-run, and while it will most certainly be a bumpy ride, things are looking good for those who are willing to buy and hold.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I have spent the past decade at the intersection of the global economy, economics and digitization.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> blockchain. </span>Ethereum does a better job of supporting development on its blockchain and will have a more lightweight proof-of-stake mining model than bitcoin [which] means that it can potentially be the backbone of web 3.0, said Daniel Polotsky, the founder of crypto ATM operator CoinFlip and panel member, who predicts ethereum's growth may even surpass bitcoin's over the next decade.Web 3.0, the idea that a decentralized version of the internet will eventually replace the Silicon Valley-centric web 2.0, has been popularized in recent years, helped by the growth of the crypto and blockchain economy that some think could form its basis. Late last year, ethereum began its long-awaited shift from bitcoin's proof-of-work security and validation model to proof-of-stake—something many developers hope will make ethereum more efficient and less energy demanding. However, it's not yet known how such a shift, not expected to be completed until well into 2022, could affect scalability or profitability for miners—those that secure ethereum's blockchain. The panel of bitcoin, ethereum and cryptocurrency experts, put together by personal finance comparison site <a aria-label=Finder class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.finder.com/uk/ethereum-eth-price-prediction href=https://www.finder.com/uk/ethereum-eth-price-prediction rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.finder.com/uk/ethereum-eth-price-prediction>Finder</a>, returned an average ethereum price prediction of $5,114 by the end of 2021—up around 20% from its current $4,350—to $15,364 by 2025 and then more than tripling to $50,788 by the end of 2030.The ethereum price is already up by 1,000% on this time last year, leaving bitcoin and many other major cryptocurrencies in the dust. Ethereum's market capitalization has now surpassed $500 billion for the first time.Ethereum's huge rally has been helped by the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), which uses crypto technology and ethereum's blockchain to recreate traditional financial services without the need for banks, and the non-fungible token (NFT) craze that has seen all manner of digital media and assets tokenized largely on ethereum's blockchain. Ethereum is currently hosting an already large but still quickly growing alternative financial system in decentralized finance or DeFi, said panelist Joshua Fraser, the cofounder of peer-to-peer platform Origin Protocol.Eventually, ethereum will be one of the main financial settlement layers of the world.

[Ethereum] was not built for high throughput, and developers know that, whereas other layer-1 solutions such as solana are, said CoreLedger AG chief executive Johannes Schweifer, who thinks ethereum will lose as much as 66% of its market share in the coming year as it struggles to solve its scalability issues. The market will expand rapidly with their maturity and they will get the lion's share of all new business that is not exclusively based on speculation, Schweifer added.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

However, some do think there are legitimate reasons for investors to buy both the dogecoin and shiba inu cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin, a fork of bitcoin that dates back to 2014, is currently less sophisticated in its smart contract capabilities than shiba inu—launched just last year. Bitcoin is designed to be scarce whereas shib is intentionally made in a way that is abundant in nature, Nirmal Ranga, chief revenue officer at bitcoin and crypto platform ZebPay, said in emailed comments, looking to shiba inu's total circulating supply of 1 quadrillion. The shiba inu token system supports innovative and artistic projects like non-fungible token (NFT) art incubators. The development of its own decentralized exchange called the ShibaSwap is also in the pipeline, all factors which have been driving the tokens value and interest among traders.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Chesnot/Getty Images)</span>Bitcoin has been trading south of $60,000 for the last several hours, after dropping to almost $58,000 this morning. The digital currency, which is the world’s most valuable in terms of market capitalization, declined to $58,151.72 around 4 a.m. EST, <a aria-label=CoinDesk figures class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk figures</a> show. It quickly mounted a modest recovery, coming close to $59,000 within an hour, additional CoinDesk data reveals. Since then, bitcoin has been stuck moving in a range between $58,000 and $60,000. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] As for the decline that bitcoin prices suffered recently, one market observer described it as being perfectly normal. “Bitcoin has had a huge run-up during October to all time highs and has now pulled back in what appears to be a healthy bullish correction,” said Jon Pearlstone, publisher of the newsletter <a aria-label=CryptoPatterns class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.cryptopatterns.net/ href=https://www.cryptopatterns.net/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.cryptopatterns.net/>CryptoPatterns</a>.He emphasized that “since Bitcoin spent so little time at the $65,000 level, prices between $52,500 and $62,000 should be considered a bullish consolidation of rangebound trading.” Since the cryptocurrency fell below $60,000, “buyers have been doing all they can to push the price back up,” said Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of the global payment network <a aria-label=Mercuryo class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://mercuryo.io/ href=https://mercuryo.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://mercuryo.io/>Mercuryo</a>.“However, there seems to be a thick resistance wall around the $60,000 level, a trend that implies the digital currency is dealing with more sell orders at that price level,” he noted. John Iadeluca, founder &amp; CEO of multi-strategy fund <a aria-label=Banz Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.banz.capital/ href=https://www.banz.capital/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.banz.capital/>Banz Capital</a>, also spoke to the resistance the cryptocurrency is facing. “Right now Bitcoin's working through a large number of sell orders around the $59,000 level,” he stated.At the same time, the hedge fund manager emphasized that the digital asset is “seeing increasing support” below that price point. William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform <a aria-label=Token Metrics class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://tokenmetrics.com/ href=https://tokenmetrics.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://tokenmetrics.com/>Token Metrics</a>, also weighed in, identifying key support. “From a technical analysis point of view, BTC has support at 58k and there is talk of support and possibly big buy orders at 54k.” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a aria-label=BitBull Capital class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ href=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bitbullcapital.com/>BitBull Capital</a>, provided similar analysis. “Currently Bitcoin is sitting on a key support level of $58,000 and as long as it maintains the $50,000 level traders can continue expecting bullish resumption,” he stated. However, should the digital currency fall out of its range and then drop below support at $52,500, it would put “a retest of the key $42500 support level back in play,” noted Pearlstone. <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Oct 27 2021 10:59am,"Shares of Robinhood plunged below its IPO price from earlier this year, a day after the company reported third-quarter earnings that substantially missed expectations because of a sharp drop in crypto trading. Shares of the popular stock trading app plunged after a big revenue miss. Robinhood’s stock was down nearly 10% to just under $36 per share late Wednesday morning, sinking below its $38 initial public offering price from late July. The popular stock trading app <a aria-label=reported class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf href=https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf>reported</a> earnings after the bell on Tuesday which came in well below Wall Street expectations: Revenue fell to $365 million from $565 million last quarter, while the company’s net loss of $2.06 per share was greater than analysts’ average expectation of a loss of $1.37 per share, as compiled by Refinitiv.The huge earnings miss was in large part due to a sharp decline in revenue from crypto trading on Robinhood’s platform, which tumbled 78% to $51 million from the last quarter.After a blockbuster start to the year—when a wild rally in meme stocks like GameStop and cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin helped spur massive growth for Robinhood, trading activity has settled down, the company’s earnings report showed.Robinhood’s total number of user accounts dropped slightly to 22.4 million, while fees tied to stock and options trades also declined. Revenue the company earns from selling customers’ trades to Wall Street’s high-speed trading firms, known as payment for order flow, was down 41% from last quarter to $267 million.That’s how much the combined fortune of Robinhood cofounders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt fell by 11:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, as shares of their <a aria-label=online brokerage class=advisor-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/best-online-brokers/ href=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/best-online-brokers/ target=_self>online brokerage</a> plummeted. Tenev and Bhatt are now worth $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, by <em>Forbes</em>’ estimates.“In [the third quarter], crypto activity came off record highs, leading to fewer new funded accounts and lower revenue as expected, CEO Vlad Tenev said after the earnings release. “Historically our growth has come in waves—the surges have come during periods of increased volatility or market events,” added Robinhood’s chief financial officer, Jason Warnick. “Going forward, we expect to continue to see the ebb and flow of our growth with market conditions, as well as product launches.”Robinhood anticipates that many of the same factors which impacted results this quarter will continue through the end of 2021.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"By launching the decentralized USDA stablecoin and other DeFi applications, Arkadiko is enhancing <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> the STX token’s capital efficiency and serving as a foundational building block to unlock Bitcoin’s trillion-dollar value.</span>The Arkadiko Bridge is a Mycenaean bridge near the modern road from Tiryns to Epidauros on the Peloponnese in Greece. The bridge dates back to the Greek Bronze Age, and it is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and the oldest preserved bridge in Europe. Like the Arkadiko Bridge, the Arkadiko protocol aspires to serve as a perennial gateway bridging DeFi and a host of new financial applications to Bitcoin.  When asked about his inspiration for launching the project, Arkadiko Core Contributor Philip De Smedt commented, “We wanted to build something that can last for centuries. The world needs a new set of decentralized financial services that ultimately settle on Bitcoin, the biggest and most secure blockchain in the world. Arkadiko requires minimal trust from the user. Protocol decisions are made through a DAO, governance is not run by a small group of people, but by a collection of contributors who help steer the protocol in the right direction.”The first major DeFi application Arkadiko launched is the ability for users to access <strong>self-repaying negative interest rate</strong> loans. The mechanism works similar to Ethereum’s MakerDAO in which crypto collateral is used to issue a crypto-backed stablecoin. In Arkadiko’s case, users deposit STX tokens as collateral (Bitcoin and USDC are planned as future collateral types) to open a vault that then returns the stablecoin USDA.Tied to the value of $1, stablecoins are a crucial construct facilitating the exchange of goods and services within the cryptoeconomy. Centralized stablecoin providers like Tether and USDC hold dollars or other liquid assets directly equivalent in value to the stablecoins they issue. Decentralized alternatives like Arkadiko’s USDA and MakerDAO’s DAI use cryptoassets as collateral to back the stablecoins they issue, requiring overcollateralization to ensure the stablecoin maintains its peg. Stablecoins serve as a medium of exchange that users are willing to spend, unlike cryptoassets like Bitcoin and Ethereum that are expected to appreciate over time. In fact, USDA is already starting to be used as a form of payment.Arkadiko Vaults offer crypto-backed loans that anyone with an internet connection can access within minutes. The stability fee serves as the annual interest rate users must pay to maintain the loan, which currently is set at 4%. However, unique to the Stacks blockchain, users have the option to leverage Stacks’ Proof of Transfer consensus mechanism in which they can stack the locked STX to earn a yield that is used to pay off the principal and interest of the loan. The historical stacking yield has averaged ~10% APY, paid in Bitcoin. At the current collateralization ratio of ~400% (or said differently, 25% loan-to-value) and after factoring in the stability fee and stacking rewards, the loan would be fully paid off in approximately three years.  In order to borrow a loan for $100, the user must deposit $400 worth of STX tokens in an Arkadiko vault (approximately 180 STX tokens at the current market price). The vault then issues 100 USDA tokens into the user’s wallet. The STX in the vault is stacked, supporting the stacks’ blockchain consensus mechanism which accrues a Bitcoin yield and pays off the loan’s principal and interest over time. The user is free to use the USDA for whatever purpose she desires, which may include swapping it for other assets, depositing it in a liquidity provider pool to earn DIKO rewards, accessing other DeFi on Bitcoin applications, or simply paying for goods and services.Due to the high collateralization ratio of 400%, the system may not be entirely capital efficient, but as new collateral types are introduced and the system becomes more mature, this collateralization ratio would be expected to drop.Imagine taking out a mortgage or an auto loan that fully pays itself off in a few years’ time. This could potentially be a revolutionary financial primitive that opens up a new means for individuals to access credit, without needing to worry about interest rate sensitivity, consumer creditworthiness, banker bias or discrimination, or central bank monetary policy.“Proof of Transfer serves as a building block that can be reused in other protocols built on Stacks, such as Arkadiko,” said Philip. “This is exactly what we envisioned when we started building Arkadiko. A stablecoin that earns a yield coming from consensus, without any human intervention. This yield can be provided in a decentralized way without relying on people. Instead it simply relies on a blockchain-native yield where these yields are transparent at any time.”Schematic for how Arkadiko USDA vaults operate. To bootstrap liquidity for the protocol, Arkadiko is launching with a generous liquidity mining program (also known as yield farming). The project has launched its native governance token, DIKO, which will be distributed to liquidity providers. <strong>1.5 million DIKO</strong> will be emitted through an incentive program in the first six weeks of launch, and emissions will continue at a decaying rate for approximately five years. At the current DIKO market price of $5, this means $7.5 million of rewards will be distributed to liquidity providers in just the first six weeks. Liquidity providers can earn these rewards by visiting Arkadiko and depositing assets into three possible pools using the Stake feature: <strong>DIKO/USDA, STX/USDA, and STX/DIKO</strong>. The projected annualized yield for these pools is currently <strong>1830%, 520%, and 1560%</strong> respectively. Investors must keep in mind these yields are variable, and they will drop as more users add liquidity to the pools and their pro rata share of the rewards decline. In order to access the USDA required to farm these pools, users can either open a STX-collateralized vault or swap their STX or DIKO tokens for USDA. The STX/USDA pool issues the highest rewards claiming 50% of all the DIKO rewards, and the other two pools claim 20% each. The remaining 10% of DIKO rewards are allocated to the staked DIKO security module, which serves as a backstop to the system. Users must keep in mind these pools are AMM-based and are thus subject to <a aria-label=impermanent loss class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/ href=https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/>impermanent loss</a>. Enterprising investors can deploy several different strategies to generate yield. A user may choose to deposit their STX to open a self-repaying Vault, thus receiving USDA equal to 25% of her collateral value. She can then pair the USDA with STX or DIKO to farm the incentives allocated to those pools. Alternatively, she may use Arkadiko’s DEX to swap STX or USDA for DIKO to then deploy DIKO in the staked DIKO security module or pair their DIKO with USDA or STX to farm those pools.  At time of writing, just a few days since the protocol’s launch, over 15 million STX (~$34.5 million) was committed to Arkadiko Vaults. Additionally, users have deposited over $15 million worth of assets into the three liquidity pools, translating to $50 million in total value locked in the protocol. Liquidity mining emissions are currently active and began Tuesday October 26<sup>th</sup>. Decentralized stablecoins are a crucial financial primitive for any DeFi ecosystem. Recently, centralized issuers such as Tether and USDC have come under scrutiny as to their legal status as unregulated financial institutions and their monetary reserves.

Arkadiko hopes to tap into Bitcoin’s superior decentralization, security, and censorship resistance to offer unstoppable decentralized financial applications.  By launching the decentralized USDA stablecoin and other DeFi applications, Arkadiko is enhancing the STX token’s capital efficiency and serving as a foundational building block to unlock Bitcoin’s trillion-dollar value.  “The Bitcoin Network is by far the most durable and secure blockchain in the industry,” said Philip. “Along with Stacks smart contracts capabilities, we seek to design and ship products that go beyond just utility, but also empower more users to participate in DeFi in an intuitive and accessible manner.”Although Arkadiko successfully passed a smart contract security audit from auditor 0F, it should still be viewed as experimental early stage software.

This inherent concentration makes bitcoin susceptible to systemic risk and also implies that the majority of the gains from further adoption are likely to fall disproportionately to a small set of participants.Researchers found the biggest 10,000 bitcoin holders held around 27% of the total 18.6 million coins in circulation at the end of 2020, with a high degree of concentration among crypto exchanges and so-called miners—those that secure the bitcoin blockchain in return for freshly-minted coins. The top 10% of miners control 90% of the bitcoin mining capacity, with just 0.1%—about 50 miners in all—contributing 50% of this.This measurement of concentration most likely is an understatement since we cannot rule out that some of the largest addresses are controlled by the same entity, researchers Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar wrote, pointing to many of the early mined bitcoins that are likely all controlled by bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto but are spread across some 20,000 different addresses. <a aria-label=CryptoCodex class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><strong data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534><em data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/cryptocodex/#2451f12d3534>CryptoCodex</em></strong></a><strong>—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious</strong>The bitcoin price has rallied over the last month, recording a fresh all-time high of $67,000 per <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> by retail investors.</span>With each of those contracts worth the equivalent of five bitcoin – or about $321,300 as of Tuesday at close – the net capital inflow from retail investors into these contracts rose by $183 million. The CME saw the value of its crypto futures contracts rise $1.58 billion (+38%) across all trader groups. Of that total, $1.31 billion went to bitcoin futures and the remaining $270 million to CME ether futures and CME micro-bitcoin futures. Moreover, CME crypto futures trading volume peaked over $9.2 billion on Thursday, making the CME one of the largest if not the largest derivatives exchange by volume that day.  CME Crypto futures open interest by futures instrumentCompared to the start of the year, the futures market reflects increases in the level of exposure by commercial traders, which include corporations and bitcoin ETF issuers like ProShares, and retail traders. Hedge funds have roughly bore the brunt of providing sell interest to all bitcoin futures buyers, with a large increase in OI in spread, meaning that an entity is both buying and selling that number of contracts – that is that they are ‘making markets’ through what is known as the carry trade: buying the commodity in the spot or cash market and selling it on the futures market. U.S. banks and even a small portion of retail traders have a higher share selling interest than at the start of year, while hedge funds have paired sharply their long bitcoin positions at the CME.Data from the CFTC showing CME open interest by major trading group, select dates<br/>While the CFTC’s Sunday data release includes activity through Tuesday October 19, the latest CME data through Friday Oct 22 shows that OI continued to rise by a very large 3,515 contracts above Tuesday’s total – another record high. Next week’s CFTC data will reveal which type of trader group captured the lion’s share of that OI increase but it is safe to assume that commercial traders had a big increase in longs and that hedge funds participated in at least 60% of all sell positions.CME Bitcoin futures open interest and bitcoin price chart<br/><strong>Analysis</strong>The big takeaway is that the BITO launch made retail investors act opportunistically. Their share of CME BTC futures holdings had been on a seven-month drop, but the BITO launch last week triggered a demand U-turn of CME futures at a record-setting pace. The retail-driven boost in CME BTC OI increase comes in addition to the rise in the roughly 4,000 long BTC contracts that commercial firms snatched up in the past few weeks. Why the sudden change? Investors familiar with CME bitcoin futures are savvy enough to figure out that the BITO ETF launch opens the gates for more crypto ETF issuance. This means that there will be demand not just for bitcoin exposure but for CME bitcoin futures contracts. In some ways, these retail investors and institutions participating in last week’s rally simply bought a hot commodity knowing there will be various more buyers – e.g., new ETF issuers – bidding up that commodity’s price.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I write about digital assets trends and am a leading creator of the Forbes Digital Assets tools and functionality our viewers require.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"The launching of the first ever bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) in the United States has made headlines, and is indicative of the increasingly mainstream nature of crypto from a legal and regulatory perspective. While this is certainly excellent news for the sector, and should be recognized for the legitimization it brings, it also has the potential to assist in addressing one other lingering issue for crypto advocates; the accounting for crypto. GettyAccounting might not always make the buzziest or most exciting headlines, but is absolutely essential for individuals and institutions seeking to fully integrate crypto into everyday transactions. The lack of crypto-specific accounting and reporting rules is not only an obstacle toward wider utilization of crypto, but is also not reflective of the economic reality connected to cryptoassets. Launching tradeable and investable bitcoin and crypto products that are available to be invested in by virtually everyone is a dramatic step in the right direction, but current accounting treatment will remain a significant headwind for the time being. Let’s take a look at the current treatment, what issues this raises, and other options that – indirectly – the launching of a bitcoin ETF opens up for the marketplace. <strong>The problem.</strong> Current consensus around how to account for and report cryptoassets is to treat them as if they were the equivalent to indefinite lived intangible assets. On the surface this looks like a perfectly reasonable approach; cryptoassets are intangible in nature, and even tokenizing physical assets still results in the creation of intangible tokens. Where the issue arises, however, is that by classifying and treating crypto as such means that these assets must also be tested for impairment on a recurring basis. Without diving into too much accounting minutia the test for impairment is a multi-step process that needs to be performed either 1) an annual basis, and/or 2) when a change in economic conditions necessitates a more frequent test. Given the volatility of bitcoin and other cryptoassets – which have been trending upward recently but has not always been a straight line up – this could lead to organizations having to mark down different crypto holdings. These losses, even if no external transactions take place at these lower price levels – will be shown both on the balance sheet and income statement of these organizations. The real issue, however, is that these losses are permanent and are not ever able to be reversed, even if the prices of these assets subsequently recover. In other words, the reality of asset valuations might not be shown in the financial statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). As organizations across different economic sectors transact in bitcoin, hold some in reserve on balance sheets, or hold them on behalf of clients, this is quickly becoming a common consideration in the marketplace. <strong>A potential solution</strong>. Launching a bitcoin ETF might not, at first, seem like a potential solution to the above issues raised around accounting, impairment, and reporting of cryptoassets. Taking a closer look, however, reveals several key takeaways that market participants should notice and incorporate going forward. Firstly, the launching of a bitcoin ETF signals the approval of this idea – rather obviously – by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Setting aside the ongoing discourse regarding whether crypto are securities for the moment, there is another angle to this story. Put simply the fact that, in addition the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the SEC is actively engaging with the sector opens the door to revisit the issues of how crypto is accounted for since policymakers are clearly interested in – and better understanding – the space. Secondly, and building on this greater acceptance and understanding is the opportunity for market participants to attempt and reorient the regulatory conversation. As increasing numbers of organizations buy, sell, hold, and otherwise utilize crypto as a core component of operations it makes sense that the regulatory – and hopefully accounting – conversations will evolve and mature. It is too soon to state with any authority how the conversation around crypto accounting will evolve, since depending on the specific cryptoasset in question the accounting treatment could logically vary quite a bit. Treating and classifying crypto as derivatives, commodities, cash equivalents, or inventory might all make sense depending on the facts and circumstances of the situation. With that context, and complications that come with such a multi-faceted sector and space, attempting to address every accounting and reporting issue at once would be foolhardy. One place to start this process, however, is by incorporating cryptoassets into existing accounting and reporting frameworks and allow organizations to hold these financial instruments at fair market value (current market price). Volatility will never vanish from the crypto sector, nor any other space, but allowing these changes to shown in a transparent, comparable, and consistent matter is essential. The entire point of accounting and reporting rules, after all, is to communicate information and data as they relate to the performance of the organization or asset, and it is time that crypto accounting caught up with market realities.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a professor at the City University of New York – Lehman College.

Mar 5 2022 02:18pm ,"BitcoinI want to start by addressing the recent pullback in Bitcoin and Ether prices, as well as shares of crypto miners, since Bitcoin hit a new record high last week. It’s important for investors to remember that the crypto ecosystem remains, and is expected to remain, highly volatile.Whereas gold bullion and the S&amp;P 500 have a standard deviation of ±1% over a single trading day, Bitcoin has one closer to ±4%. Ether’s is even higher at ±6%, and HIVE Blockchain Technologies can easily go up or down 8% during any given trading session.Needless to say, the crypto ecosystem is high-risk and potentially high-reward, and it’s essential that investors who are thinking of participating manage their expectations.There’s much more to cover from last week that was! Below are five Bitcoin developments you need to know.Many of you reading this may be aware that Wall Street finally got a Bitcoin-linked ETF. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which tracks the performance of Bitcoin futures contracts, was first out of the gate last Monday, mere days after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it would no longer block the issuance of investment products related to the digital asset.But that’s not the only record BITO now holds. The ETF attracted over $1 billion in as little as two days after its debut, making it the fastest ever to reach that milestone. The previous recordholder, appropriately enough, was State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), launched in 2004. It took the popular gold-backed ETF three days to reach $1 billion in assets.BITO may be the first, but it will hardly be the last. A second Bitcoin futures fund, the actively managed Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), became available for trading on Friday.Having said that, not everyone is jumping to buy a Bitcoin futures contract. Of the nearly 700 people who took a recent HIVE poll, more than three quarters said they were either “probably” or “absolutely” not interested in an ETF that tracks the futures market. Presumably they are holding out for a Bitcoin spot ETF, or they would prefer to own the crypto outright.HIVE tweetThe price of Bitcoin topped $66,000 for the first time ever last Wednesday, pushing its market cap above an incredible $1.3 trillion. The surge was driven largely by the debut of BITO as well as the undeniable power of FOMO, or fear of missing out.This has reawakened speculation that the crypto is headed for $100,000, perhaps as early as year’s end. Take a look at the logarithmic chart below. Each horizontal line represents a growth factor of 10.Arithmetically, there are a lot of numbers in between $66,000 and $100,000, but geometrically, it’s a hop and a skip.Bitcoin reaches new ATH of $66k last weekBITO wasn’t the only love Bitcoin got from institutional investors last week. For the first time ever, a U.S. pension fund has invested in the space. On Thursday, the $5.5 billion Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRRF) announced that it had purchased <a aria-label=$25 million in Bitcoin and Ether, class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/houston-firefighters-relief-and-retirement-fund-announces-bitcoin-purchase-301405769.html href=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/houston-firefighters-relief-and-retirement-fund-announces-bitcoin-purchase-301405769.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/houston-firefighters-relief-and-retirement-fund-announces-bitcoin-purchase-301405769.html>$25 million in Bitcoin and Ether,</a> representing a “watershed moment for Bitcoin and its place in public pensions,” according to Nate Conrad, Global Head of Asset Management at New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), which facilitated the purchase. “Fiduciaries are increasingly aware of how even a small allocation to digital assets can make a big impact over time,” Conrad went on.Like BITO, this allocation may be the first of its kind, but I don’t believe it will be the last. Imagine what would happen to Bitcoin and Ether’s price if the approximately $440 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), the largest such fund in the U.S., got involved.Bitcoin’s been called lots of things over the years. It’s “worse than tulips.” It’s a bubble. Warren Buffett described it as “rat poison squared.” More recently, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said it’s “worthless.”Well, now nearly anyone will be able to convert their loose change into “worthless” Bitcoin at their neighborhood Walmart. Last week, it was being reported that Walmart quietly began installing special Coinstar machines at select locations that give customers the option to buy Bitcoin.Some 200 kiosks are currently available at the giant retailer, but according to Bloomberg, there are plans to install <a aria-label=as many as 8,000 of them class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/walmart-shoppers-can-now-buy-bitcoin-at-200-kiosks-in-its-stores?sref=1pPyLRr7 href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/walmart-shoppers-can-now-buy-bitcoin-at-200-kiosks-in-its-stores?sref=1pPyLRr7 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/walmart-shoppers-can-now-buy-bitcoin-at-200-kiosks-in-its-stores?sref=1pPyLRr7>as many as 8,000 of them</a> over time.On a final note, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) released its quarterly report last week, and it contained much to celebrate about Bitcoin. If you recall, this group came together during the summer in response to Elon Musk’s claims that Bitcoin mining consumed too much energy, and <a aria-label=too much dirty energy. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk-a-ceo-blog-by-frank-holmes/note-to-elon-crypto-miners-are-part-of-the-solution-to-curbing-greenhouse-gas-emissions1 href=https://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk-a-ceo-blog-by-frank-holmes/note-to-elon-crypto-miners-are-part-of-the-solution-to-curbing-greenhouse-gas-emissions1 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk-a-ceo-blog-by-frank-holmes/note-to-elon-crypto-miners-are-part-of-the-solution-to-curbing-greenhouse-gas-emissions1>too much <em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk-a-ceo-blog-by-frank-holmes/note-to-elon-crypto-miners-are-part-of-the-solution-to-curbing-greenhouse-gas-emissions1>dirty</em> energy.</a> The Council’s findings, on the other hand, tell a very different story.According to the group, which is headed by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, and of which HIVE is a member, Bitcoin mining uses a negligible amount of energy globally when stacked against any major country and even any major industry, gold mining included.In fact, you may be surprised to learn that Bitcoin mining uses even less energy than holiday lights do every year.And contrary to Elon Musk’s claims, the network uses a more sustainable energy mix than any major country on earth. Germany leads this list at nearly half renewable, whereas the global Bitcoin mining network is estimated to be 57.7%. The figure rises to almost 66% for the members of the BMC. And then there’s HIVE, which uses 100% green renewable energy to mine Bitcoin and Ether.   HIVE uses 100% green energy<strong><em>To learn what else might be driving Bitcoin prices right now, be sure to watch my video on Metcalfe’s Law by </em></strong><a aria-label=clicking here! class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daOCH_0lZIE href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daOCH_0lZIE rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daOCH_0lZIE><strong data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daOCH_0lZIE><em data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daOCH_0lZIE>clicking here!</em></strong></a><br/>U.S. Global Investors is very proud to have been a sponsor of the 2021 Health Care Heroes, the annual event that celebrates the doctors, nurses, researchers and other health care professionals who serve our hometown of San Antonio.

Though ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE: BITO) is not exactly what purists wanted—a fund that invests directly in bitcoin—its launch marks another watershed moment for the nascent market. It also opens up exposure to the cryptocurrency to a large segment of investors with brokerage accounts. The offering is based on cash-settled, front-month CME bitcoin futures—monthly contracts with the nearest expiration date that trade on the Chicago-based CME exchange—and comes with a management fee of 0.95%, to be paid each year as a percentage of investment’s value.The debut could not be more successful: after a mere two days of trading, the ETF had $1.1 billion under management and its trading volume topped $1.2 billion. <a aria-label=According to Bloomberg Intelligence data class=color-link

Mar 5 2022 02:18pm ,"Getty ImagesThe bull case for bitcoin is fairly straightforward. Risk assets are on the up and up again, and bitcoin’s leading the way. It’s outperforming growth stocks at an unusually powerful pace this past month, something that in the past has preceded big breakouts for crypto. Even the heady narrative of currency debasement and hyperinflation still rings true for some, with stagflation the number one concern among investors. But forget the fantasies about what bitcoin’s utility may one day be – that doesn’t matter. What matters is that bitcoin history tells us that if it breaks out higher past a previous record, it pays to chase the rally. And in case you haven’t noticed, people are pretty hyped about this new ETF. It’s an undeniably bullish cocktail.Now, the bearish take.Firstly, the price action in bitcoin is not quite as bullish as it was the last time it was approaching an all-time high. RSI – the technical momentum measure that I identified as a red flag back at $65k in April – is flashing yellow. Momentum today is much more muted than the last time bitcoin was surging toward an all-time high. Bitcoin was on fire this time last year as it screamed toward the $20k record, notching RSI levels as high as 90. Today, RSI is 72. It’s not nearly as alarming as in April when RSI was downtrending, but it might make the hurdle over $65k a bit harder to clear.   There’s a bigger issue, though. For this thesis, let’s make the assumption that the vast majority of people are interested in buying bitcoin because they think it will make them money: to sell it to the Next Guy. Let’s also establish that the debut of the bitcoin ETF marks the full integration of bitcoin into the investing marketplace. With the ETF, bitcoin is now completely accessible to anyone who has any interest in the asset. You don’t have to have an account with a strictly crypto broker, make a digital wallet or have enough money in your account to trade futures. And the most important development: your advisor can do it for you with the simple – fully legal – punch of a button. The barrier to entry in bitcoin is now zero.  If bitcoin is, in fact, about selling to the next guy, an ETF is not a long-term bullish catalyst. In fact, it’s the opposite. It is as close to a formal a beginning to the end of the “adoption” narrative as there is. The ETF vehicle is as entry-level as it gets. The first step for new investors. The everyday person. The consummate Next Guy. With a ton more bitcoin ETFs on the way, the pool of remaining “next guys” to sell to will begin to shrink rapidly. For bitcoin whales and devout coiners who’ve been awaiting this moment for years, the ETF screams Mission Accomplished.

Bitcoin has reached its highest level since March 5, 2018.(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)</span>After months of rumors and attempts from multiple firms, ProShares have launched the the first U.S. Bitcoin ETF this week. It is the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (ticker: BITO). Now you can get exposure to Bitcoin in your brokerage account.First off, though this helps with the complexity of owning Bitcoin, it doesn’t do away with potential fees. The ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) charges 0.95% a year. That means if you invest $10,000 in the fund and the price doesn’t change, you are charged $95 a year for holding in the investment. That’s quite high for an ETF, but the fees may decline as other Bitcoin ETFs emerge. Bid/ask spreads are worth keeping an eye on too as this ETF continues to trade over time, for now the fund has attracted a lot of volume.Technically, the fund does not actually own Bitcoin. The fund holds Bitcoin futures based on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin Reference Rate. This gets the fund out of the tricky business of Bitcoin custody, and may be one reason why the SEC approved this fund first. However, this does mean that the ETF is exposed to any risks inherent in the futures market such as counterparty risk and potential margin and collateral requirements. Also, depending on how the futures are traded there is some risk that the way futures prices move don’t exactly mirror the price moves of Bitcoin. Futures and ETFs are both well-established financial instruments, so the overall risks here are low. However, the price of a future not matching the spot price is quite routine for a host of reasons and so if you’re buying the ETF don’t expect your returns to track the Bitcoin price perfectly. Of course, time will tell if this works out in your favor. There may well be times when spot Bitcoin performs better and other times when futures have an edge. However, some studies have suggested that if the way that the ETF trades futures is known by other market participants that may create a drag on returns due to front running and other practices. Extreme market events, such as financial crises, may also cause the ETF to deviate from the Bitcoin price.It is also worth noting that unlike many ETFs this is not a diversified strategy. If you, for example, own an S&amp;P 500 ETF then if Apple 
 <fbs-ticker data-href=https://www.forbes.com/companies/apple data-name=AAPL>
<a aria-label=AAPL class=ticker-link data-ga-track=Ticker:AAPL data-vars-event-label=ticker:AAPL href=https://www.forbes.com/companies/apple rel=noopener noreferrer target=_blank>AAPL</a>
</fbs-ticker> has a bad day (or year), Amazon may have a good one and you’ll likely benefit from the progress of stronger performing companies over time. With this ETF it’s a bet on Bitcoin alone, and should, for example, Ethereum or another cryptocurrency outperform Bitcoin, you will fail to benefit.So, this is a relatively expensive way to own Bitcoin due to the fee of 0.95% a year embedded in the ETF. Given the use of futures and the annual fee, Bitcoin’s spot price is unlikely to be tracked precisely. However, it is also a simple way to make Bitcoin part of your portfolio and an important milestone in financial innovation. Perhaps most importantly, the approval of this ETF should pave the way for other innovations in the cryptocurrency space making these assets more accessible for investors.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;Simon is the author of Digital Wealth and Strategic Project Portfolio Management.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin is overbought, according to the RSI. (Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>... [+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)</span>Bitcoin prices climbed to a fresh, all-time high today, surpassing their prior zenith and rallying to almost $67,000. The world’s most prominent digital currency reached $66,974.77 this morning, according to <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a>. Since then, the cryptocurrency has managed to retain almost all of its recent gains, trading north of $66,000 since attaining its new high, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. Some market analysts have voiced concerns that bitcoin is overbought, pointing to technical indicators like the <a aria-label=Relative Strength Index class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp>Relative Strength Index</a> (RSI). The RSI measures the extent to which an asset is either overbought or oversold by evaluating recent changes in price. While a value of 30 or less for this indicator generally points to oversold conditions, a value of 70 or higher suggests an asset is overbought and may be headed for a change in trend. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] CoinDesk reporter Omkar Godbole spoke to this in an <a aria-label=article class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/20/ether-awaits-price-breakout-after-bitcoins-record-daily-close/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/20/ether-awaits-price-breakout-after-bitcoins-record-daily-close/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/20/ether-awaits-price-breakout-after-bitcoins-record-daily-close/>article</a> published earlier today, stating that:“The daily RSI is signaling overbought conditions. So, a possibility of a temporary pullback cannot be ruled out.” Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider <a aria-label=Trade The Chain class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.tradethechain.com/ href=https://www.tradethechain.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.tradethechain.com/>Trade The Chain</a>, commented on this situation: “There are currently several indicators signaling that BTC is in ‘overbought’ territory, but these indicators have actually been oversold for the majority of the month of October.” He emphasized investor sentiment and market dynamics, offering a bullish take. “We see some potential resistance for Bitcoin around $68,000, but as long as trader attitude remains bullish and, at the same time, trade volumes continue to increase, we expect Bitcoin to climb at least a few percentage points higher for this move.”Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for <a aria-label=Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://gerberkawasaki.com/ href=https://gerberkawasaki.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://gerberkawasaki.com/>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management</a>, also spoke to the highly optimistic mindset of investors. “The short-term market sentiment is very bullish,” he stated, “especially since we just broke all time highs.” Armando Aguilar, vice president of Digital Assets Strategy for <a aria-label=Fundstrat Global Advisors class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://fundstrat.com/ href=https://fundstrat.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://fundstrat.com/>Fundstrat Global Advisors</a>, provided a similar perspective, stating that the crypto markets are currently characterized by “extreme greed.”He noted that “A 90+ RSI seems to match with previous BTC tops.” Aguilar also spoke to bullish market dynamics. “The capital inflows into BTC futures, the buying demand from spot BTC and overall macro conditions remain bullish,” he said. “Additionally, the visual barrier of a new ATH and FOMO will play a role in keeping a level of momentum. Crypto market cap in October has gone from $1.9T to $2.6T.”“I think there is still more room for BTC to run before a temporary pullback happens,” stated Aguilar. <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol. </em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices reached a record high of nearly $67,000 today. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)Bitcoin prices rose to a brand new record today, breaking through the previous all-time high set earlier this year. The world’s most prominent digital currency reached $66,974.77 around 10:45 a.m. EDT, <a aria-label=CoinDesk figures class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk figures</a> show. At this point, the cryptocurrency’s price has more than doubled in 2021, starting the year out below $29,000, additional CoinDesk data reveals. More specifically, bitcoin has rallied 131% since that time. Up until today, the cryptocurrency’s all-time high was $64,888.99, a price the digital asset attained in April. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] As for what has fueled these latest gains in bitcoin, there are certainly some notable developments that have coincided with this rally. For starters, the first U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) started trading yesterday on The New York Stock Exchange, and its launch managed to generate significant visibility. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which is now trading under the ticker BITO, is linked to futures contracts for the digital currency. As a result, some market observers have voiced their concerns about this particular fund, since it isn’t a spot ETF. However, others have interpreted its listing as a sign of progress, speculating that The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to approve the ProShares fund means the regulator is coming closer to providing a spot bitcoin ETF with a green light.Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider <a aria-label=Trade The Chain class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.tradethechain.com/ href=https://www.tradethechain.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.tradethechain.com/>Trade The Chain</a>, weighed in on these developments. “Bitcoin’s recent leap past all time highs was driven primarily due to bullish sentiment brought on by the launch of the first ever BTC futures ETF,” he stated. “This, along with some positive language from regulators in early October, exacerbated Bitcoin’s climb past $65,000.”Kay Khemani,<strong> </strong>managing director at <a aria-label=Spectre.ai class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://spectre.ai/ href=https://spectre.ai/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://spectre.ai/>Spectre.ai</a>, also chimed in. “This all-time high does not come as a surprise: it was written on the cards well back since Bitcoin’s bulls held the $30,000 Maginot line which had inspired a false sense of security,” he stated. “The fundamental catalyst that has enabled Bitcoin to hit an all-time record price has no doubt been the recently approved ProShares Bitcoin Futures ETF, which will likely lead to more adoption of the currency triggering a powerful feedback loop that looks certain to ignite the flame for a continued bull run.” <strong>Exchange Reserves</strong>While several analysts spoke to the importance of the recently approved ProShares ETF, another development that coincided bitcoin’s recent gains has been highly favorable fundamentals. <a aria-label=Cointelegraph class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-eyes-65k-breakout-as-btc-exchanges-reserves-fall-to-2018-lows href=https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-eyes-65k-breakout-as-btc-exchanges-reserves-fall-to-2018-lows rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-eyes-65k-breakout-as-btc-exchanges-reserves-fall-to-2018-lows>Cointelegraph</a> reported on this earlier today, noting that demand for bitcoin has been pushing higher, as made evident by the number of wallets holding $100 and $10 million in bitcoin both reaching all-time highs. Further, the bitcoin reserves on exchanges declined lately, falling to 2.379 million, a more-than three-year low, according to CryptoQuant data reported on in the same Cointelegraph article. When the media outlet published an article on this matter earlier today, the figure had increased slightly, rising to 2.38 million.Since these reserves have deteriorated recently, it pointed to a reduced amount of bitcoin available for sale, as well as for purposes like engaging in margin trading or buying altcoins (digital currencies other than bitcoin, noted CryptoQuant. <em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Oct 20 2021 10:01am," The price of bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high for the first time in more than six months Wednesday morning, as investors rallied around the blockbuster debut of the first-ever bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund.  The price of bitcoin topped $64,000 Wednesday morning.The price of bitcoin jumped more than 4% to $66,140 on Wednesday morning shortly before 10 a.m. EDT, surpassing a record high of about $64,800 set on April 14, according to crypto data website CoinGecko.With the latest boost, bitcoin prices have now skyrocketed nearly 20% over the past week amid fervor for the <a aria-label=debut class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/10/19/historic-bitcoin-futures-etf-debuts-on-new-york-stock-exchange/ href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/10/19/historic-bitcoin-futures-etf-debuts-on-new-york-stock-exchange/ target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/10/19/historic-bitcoin-futures-etf-debuts-on-new-york-stock-exchange/>debut</a> of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which posted roughly $1 billion in volume and rose 4.7% during its <a aria-label=first day class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2021/10/19/bitcoin-etf-rises-47-in-first-day-of-trading-as-bitcoin-prices-approach-all-time-highs/?sh=24fb5d809135 href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2021/10/19/bitcoin-etf-rises-47-in-first-day-of-trading-as-bitcoin-prices-approach-all-time-highs/?sh=24fb5d809135 target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2021/10/19/bitcoin-etf-rises-47-in-first-day-of-trading-as-bitcoin-prices-approach-all-time-highs/?sh=24fb5d809135>first day</a> of trading on Tuesday.Launched on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BITO, the ProShares fund marks the first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund in the United States, making investing in bitcoin accessible to the six in ten Americans who own brokerage accounts but may not want to “go through the hassle and learning curve” of establishing an account with a cryptocurrency provider, ProShares CEO Michael L.

Though she cautions the futures contracts could have increased volatility as they approach expiration, Bell adds: “Crypto is finding its footing as an investment vehicle, and the rollout of ETFs could be a big step in that direction.”Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have soared to meteoric highs during the pandemic in light of inflationary concerns and increased institutional adoption, but prices started crashing in April, when Tesla—one of bitcoin’s biggest corporate investors—disclosed it <a aria-label=sold a large class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/tesla-sold-bitcoin-in-q1-for-proceeds-of-272m href=https://www.coindesk.com/tesla-sold-bitcoin-in-q1-for-proceeds-of-272m rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/tesla-sold-bitcoin-in-q1-for-proceeds-of-272m>sold a large</a> portion of its holdings and wouldn’t buy more until bitcoin mining consumed less energy.

Despite active price growth, not all crypto market participants are equally optimistic, Alex Kuptsikevch, senior financial analyst at FxPro, wrote in emailed comments. Some believe that now we are witnessing not the beginning of a new stage of large-scale growth but are approaching a correction. This is because reaching a new historical high (or a series of historical highs) may provoke the beginning of aggressive profit-taking by large investors who opened positions during the rebound from $30,000.There are some views that the run-up in [bitcoin's price] is already discounting this approval, Fundstrat's Lee added. To an extent, this is probably true, since bitcoin has surged to near all-time highs in the past few weeks. But in our view, the price of bitcoin will continue to rise, well after actual approval of the ETF.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world.

Mar 6 2022 11:28am ,"Bitcoin prices have been rallying today. (Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Bitcoin prices rallied today, coming within a single percentage point of reaching the all-time high they set early this year. The digital currency rose to as much as $64,309.33 this afternoon, <a aria-label=CoinDesk data class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>CoinDesk data</a> showed. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading less than 1% below the all-time high of $64,888.99 it reached in April, additional CoinDesk figures show. The digital asset enjoyed these gains the same day that The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first such fund available in the U.S., started trading on The New York Stock Exchange. Some analysts have criticized the aforementioned exchange-traded fund, noting that it is not a spot-based ETF and is instead linked to futures contracts. One <a aria-label=article class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investment-advisers-extremely-skeptical-about-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-its-a-hard-thing-for-rias-to-recommend-an-inferior-crypto-product-11634481183 href=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investment-advisers-extremely-skeptical-about-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-its-a-hard-thing-for-rias-to-recommend-an-inferior-crypto-product-11634481183 rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investment-advisers-extremely-skeptical-about-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-its-a-hard-thing-for-rias-to-recommend-an-inferior-crypto-product-11634481183>article</a>, written by a MarketWatch editor named Mark DeCambre, went so far as to describe this fund as “an inferior futures product,” citing the input of registered investment advisers. However, other market observers have taken a more optimistic slant, interpreting the listing of this ETF as a bullish development. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Several experts stated that the availability of this new ETF could help entice investors, drawing them to cryptocurrencies. “The launch of ProShares’ bitcoin ETF on the NYSE provides the validation that some investors need to consider adding BTC to their portfolio,” stated Hong Fang, CEO of <a aria-label=Okcoin class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.okcoin.com/ href=https://www.okcoin.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.okcoin.com/>Okcoin</a>. Further, it “may be a sign that more institutional support for crypto is coming.”“For investors who have long been deterred by regulatory uncertainty and risk, this move signals the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as an asset class and offers an opportunity to gain indirect exposure to digital assets through a less-risky vehicle,” she stated. “This will ultimately bring larger, more traditional institutions into the crypto market and with them, a significant amount of capital.” Ben Armstrong, founder of<a aria-label=BitBoy Crypto class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitboycrypto.com/ href=https://bitboycrypto.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitboycrypto.com/> BitBoy Crypto</a>, also weighed in. “It's true that exchanges like Coinbase and KuCoin have made buying crypto easy,” he noted. “But there is still a lot of FUD around crypto to the regular investor or portfolio manager that has only been seeing bogus headlines about ransomware, Russian hackers, and Elizabeth Warren spouting nonsense.”“They prefer to see their money managed by a third party, and if that fits their investing strategy, so be it,” said Armstrong.Amber Ghaddar, cofounder of decentralized capital marketplace <a aria-label=AllianceBlock class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.allianceblock.io/#team href=https://www.allianceblock.io/#team rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.allianceblock.io/#team>AllianceBlock</a>, also provided some input on the matter. “ETFs trade like equities in terms of settlement. They fall under Equity in terms of Asset Allocation,” she noted. “So technically, now, any retail investor with a standard brokerage account and any tier 3 institutional player can invest in Bitcoin without having to set up digital custodianship, update its infrastructure and/or amend its asset allocation requirements.”“A US ETF, whether futures or spot, is a welcome development in the US and should pave the way for increased adoption.”<em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

Oct 19 2021 09:40am,"The first bitcoin futures ETF makes its stock market debutThe first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund in the United States today debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, presenting new investment opportunities for holders of brokerage accounts. Though the offering, called the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (trading as BITO), falls short of what the cryptocurrency industry has long advocated for—funds that invest directly in bitcoin—its launch marks another watershed moment for the nascent market.

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which will trade under the ticker symbol BITO, will invest “primarily” in bitcoin futures, according to a statement announcing the planned launch. This new fund could provide investors with significant opportunity to gain exposure to bitcoin without using a digital currency exchange like Coinbase or Kraken.

The piece quoted Ben Cruikshank, head of investing platform Flourish, which is owned by MassMutual and works with RIAs who have a combined total of more than $1 trillion in assets under management. “The firms we are speaking to are extremely skeptical” of a futures-based bitcoin ETF, he stated. “The feedback that I’m getting is a derivative is a less efficient form of ownership,” Cruikshank noted. Further, RIAs have been noting that the bitcoin ETF scheduled to go live tomorrow is a “complicated futures product,” which is less straightforward than opening an account at Coinbase. “It’s a hard thing to justify an inferior futures product,” said Cruikshank. “That is less my feedback and more what firms are telling me.” Several analysts weighed in on these concerns, offering their perspective. “Cruikshank is right on the money,” said Ben Armstrong, founder of<a aria-label=BitBoy Crypto class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://bitboycrypto.com/ href=https://bitboycrypto.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://bitboycrypto.com/> BitBoy Crypto</a>. “Spot Bitcoin that has to be settled in Bitcoin is far more bullish than futures settled on paper.” “But don't let that take the shine off a futures ETF as a whole,” he stated. “This is a paradigm shift. And it's giving old school investors that chance to have exposure to Bitcoin.” “It’s just another step to adoption which is what everyone in crypto likes to see.Shone Anstey, chairman &amp; CEO of network infrastructure company <a aria-label=LQwD Fintech Corp. class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://lqwdfintech.com/ href=https://lqwdfintech.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://lqwdfintech.com/>LQwD Fintech Corp.</a>, also spoke to this matter. He noted that the futures-based bitcoin ETF would come with greater costs and complexity compared to a spot-based fund. However, this development does “represent a significant regulatory win for the Bitcoin industry and may encourage the SEC to approve a Bitcoin Spot Price ETF.”Armando Aguilar, vice president of Digital Assets Strategy for <a aria-label=Fundstrat Global Advisors class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://fundstrat.com/ href=https://fundstrat.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://fundstrat.com/>Fundstrat Global Advisors</a>, provided a similar point of view. “A futures-based ETF is not what everyone in the space was expecting but it’s a step in the right direction as digital assets cross into the mainstream,” he stated.Sylvia Jablonski, cofounder and chief investment officer for ETF sponsor <a aria-label=Defiance ETFs class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.defianceetfs.com/ href=https://www.defianceetfs.com/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.defianceetfs.com/>Defiance ETFs</a>, also commented on the situation. “It’s very exciting news that Bitcoin in the ETF format is going to trade in US markets tomorrow,” she stated. “I believe that this opens up the world of crypto to the masses like never before.” “Is it the best vehicle for investors? Well, it depends on the investor,” noted Jablonski.“Assuming that the investor is not mining cryptocurrency or comfortable with storing in a digital wallet, the next and easiest and best way to get pure Bitcoin exposure is to buy the physical asset/currency,” she stated.“The second choice is perhaps looking at trusts that invest in cryptocurrencies. Those are the first movers in terms of listed fund-like structures, and are already trading in the secondary market (such as Grayscale and Bitwise),” said Jablonski. “The ETF is really the third derivative of exposure to Bitcoin via an exchange-listed wrapper,” she stated. “For investors who are brand new to trading crypto and are not comfortable with the aforementioned ways to get direct access, futures based etfs are a good alternative.” However, she made sure to point out the potential drawbacks investors could face by putting their money into ETFs like the one that just received approval from The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “They have tracking-error potential, additional costs associated with contango and limits in terms of AUM available to rebalance the fund after a certain size which poses additional risk,” she noted.<strong>Possible Increase In Demand</strong>The introduction of this new ETF could potentially result in greater demand, several analysts pointed out. Aguilar spoke to the proliferation of futures-based funds like the one going live tomorrow, noting that while they are not spot ETFs, he still thinks they will manage to attract substantial inflows from investors. Jack McDonald, CEO of fintech firm <a aria-label=PolySign class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://www.polysign.io/ href=https://www.polysign.io/ rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://www.polysign.io/>PolySign</a>, also chimed in. “In general, I think a Bitcoin ETF will generate more demand for Bitcoin than not having one because it solves a lot of regulatory issues that many investors seek clarity on.” he stated. “That said, a spot ETF for Bitcoin would generate much more demand than a futures ETF for Bitcoin given the relative costs and fees associated with the latter.”<em>Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and sol.</em><p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I am a financial writer and editor with strong knowledge of asset markets and investing concepts.

<a aria-label=CME class=ticker-link data-ga-track=Ticker:CME data-vars-event-label=ticker:CME href=https://www.forbes.com/companies/cme-group rel=noopener noreferrer target=_blank>CME</a>
</fbs-ticker> is starting to look like a trend. A Forbes analysis of Commitments of Traders (COT) and CME Group data starting from about two weeks ago suggests that the rise in investor capital tied up in bitcoin futures open interest (OI) contracts held at the CME exchange and the number of participating large traders is now broader. The number of large traders required to disclose their futures activity to the Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) - those with an exposure equivalent to five or more bitcoins - increased 29% in two weeks to 94. Compared to two weeks ago, the number of COT big traders now includes twenty more hedge funds, four more banks, and two more commercial traders. This could provide pivotal support to the rising bitcoin trend now that the April 2021 record of $64,900 is merely 4% away. Over the same period, bitcoin OI rose 55% to 10,918 contracts, according to the CFTC’s COT weekly report ending on October 12. By Friday’s close, before it was confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved its first bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), BTC futures OI had risen an additional 7% intraweek to 11,682 contracts. Retail investors trading at the CME have sold modestly into the ongoing bitcoin rally, in a sign they haven’t yet caught on what institutional traders are doing. Retail investors will likely come around in due time, as it becomes clear that the current rally can sustain gains above last April’s high.One of the major changes this past week was the news that eight major banks had for a second week added 500 short bitcoin futures contracts to their collective OI holdings, according to the COT data. Breaking the 1,000 contract barrier in two weeks after having an average of 138 short contracts for more than seven months suggests that large banks are starting to assume a sell-side liquidity role for bitcoin, like they do for other futures instruments. Up until now, only hedge funds had served in that capacity. With more liquidity, the market operates more smoothly and price gaps in a security become less frequent and smaller in size.  Chart depicting changes in the number of bitcoin futures contracts held in open interest by major <span class=plus data-ga-track=caption expand>...

[+]</span><span class=expanded-caption> experienced since the beginning of the year. </span><strong>Analysis</strong>No matter which way one looks at the SEC approval of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, it is a major wink from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to US-regulated cash and futures exchanges. It would not be at all surprising to see a major boost in CME Group stock price as a result of the SEC bitcoin futures ETF decision. The dollar value of CME crypto futures reached an all-time record high of $4.16 billion on Tuesday, up 679% from a year prior. The double-digit OI growth referenced earlier is highly correlated with future transactional earnings for the CME. It should be noted, however, that crypto futures remain a small but fast-growing source of revenue for CME Group. Display of dollar value of CME crypto futures open interest since May 2020.To be sure, the sharp rise in the number of futures OI contracts is in part related to the fact that the bitcoin futures ETF now approved in the United States will require the issuing entities (e.g., ProShares initially, later other firms like Invesco

The ProShares bitcoin ETF shares are expected to make their trading debut at the NYSE exchange tomorrow. With the ProShares precedent approved, other bitcoin ETF applications based on bitcoin futures should be approved and begin trading at Nasdaq

</fbs-ticker> and Cboe in short order. So what will ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF investors own? It might be easier to say that they will not own bitcoin. ETF shares are a familiar, cost efficient instrument for individuals or institutions to own, but clinically speaking they derive their value from something else, in this case from a bitcoin futures, which is a derivative of bitcoin. Thus, bitcoin is the cash asset, the bitcoin futures is the first derivatives product, and the ETF holding bitcoin futures is the second derivatives product. For now, the SEC does not want ETFs to hold physical bitcoin, and for an understandable reason. If the SEC gave carte blanche to asset managers to divert even a small portion of the tens of trillions in US investor capital to buy bitcoin directly, it would create a massive distortion in the supply-demand curve of bitcoin, an asset with a fixed issuance. So the current SEC experiment underway could be that the use of double derivatives will somehow absorb much of the popular demand for bitcoin without causing the cryptocurrency to skyrocket overnight. Another possible explanation is that when the CFTC initially approved traditional bitcoin futures (as opposed to an ETF) in 2017, it was widely <a aria-label=blamed class=color-link data-ga-track=ExternalLink:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-popped-2017-bitcoin-191510223.html href=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-popped-2017-bitcoin-191510223.html rel=nofollow noopener noreferrer target=_blank title=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-popped-2017-bitcoin-191510223.html>blamed</a> for popping the bitcoin bubble of 2017. Be that as it may, for each bitcoin ETF share to be issued, a certain number of bitcoin futures would need to be held in reserve. The convertibility of CME bitcoin futures is such that investors are able to settle in bitcoin if a bitcoin holder wants to exchange them for a futures contract exposure. But in practice, more than 99% of all bitcoin futures settlement is cash-settled when a futures exposure ends, meaning that bitcoin futures investors exchange cash for the difference between the price when they entered into the contract and the price when they closed the transaction. CME bitcoin futures, however, can exist without contractual or regulatory obligations that they hold the equivalent of five bitcoins.The price of bitcoin at or above $60,000 despite heavy headwinds from China trouble (Evergrande, energy woes, slow GDP) and supply-chain troubles points to greater confidence in the most popular cryptocurrency. The massive U.S. institutional door - that of bitcoin ETFs - that has just opened has more chances of boosting bitcoin into record territory than a drop below $60,000. It remains to be seen, however, how much of a boost the SEC’s double-derivative demand shock absorber will have on the bitcoin cash market. For now, the U.S. market is the only jurisdiction that keeps approved ETF vehicles from holding actual bitcoins and nothing suggests other countries will follow the U.S. model. <br/>Additional in depth coverage of digital assets available at <a aria-label=Forbes CryptoAsset and Blockchain Advisor class=color-link data-ga-track=InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor href=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor target=_self title=https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbescryptoassetadvisor>Forbes CryptoAsset and Blockchain Advisor</a> newsletter.<p class=contrib-bio data-author-html-description=&lt;p&gt;I write about digital assets trends and am a leading creator of the Forbes Digital Assets tools and functionality our viewers require.
