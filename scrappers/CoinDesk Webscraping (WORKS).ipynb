Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up 2.7% to over $2,600 in the same time period.“Bitcoin is rallying as risky assets finish a very bad January on a positive note,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, the Americas, wrote in his daily market update. “Bitcoin bullish momentum is slowly building up and it could surprise to the upside if the dollar continues to weaken as much of the Fed tightening for the year begins to get priced in.”Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major crypto exchanges was significantly lower than a week ago. Many stock indexes in Asia were closed amid the weeklong lunar New Year (also known as Chinese New Year) holidays. Many crypto traders in the region may also have taken time off.Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges reported nearly $100 billion in trading volume in January, according to href=\"https://dune.xyz/hagaetc/dex-metrics\"Dune Analytics. The total trading volume in DEXs previously dropped significantly following its peak last May. But the high volume has returned in recent months.Some of January’s volume may be associated with the volatility of the markets and the drama in href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/\" target=\"_blank\"decentralized finance protocol href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/27/how-did-a-former-quadriga-exec-end-up-running-a-defi-protocol-wonderland-founder-explains/\"Wonderland, and yet one analyst said the steadily growing volume shows a “renewed growth” in the DeFi sector.“The flawless execution without downtime, or the amazing ability for these protocols to run uninterrupted even amidst drama from founders/developers and declining asset prices…should be the focus,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto investment managing firm Arca, href=\"https://www.ar.ca/blog/defi-is-beautiful-amidst-carnage-and-chaos\"wrote in his blog dated Monday. “There is a thriving underlying ecosystem despite one-off scams, hacks, and ousted bad actors.”href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/31/bitcoin-holding-support-above-37k-resistance-at-40k-45k/\" target=\"_blank\"Bitcoin Holding Support Above $37K; Resistance at $40K-$45KBitcoin was rising toward the top of a weeklong trading range as oversold signals remain intact. Oversold refers to investors believing the asset is trading below its true value. BTC was trading at about $38,500 at press time and is up 4% over the past week.Initial href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/\"resistance is seen at $40,000, which is an old support level that was rejected on Jan. 20. Buyers will need to make a decisive move above $40,000-$45,000 in order to reverse the downtrend that has been in place since November.For now, BTC’s 20% price decline in January could attract short-term buyers. Traders could place additional bids heading into the Asia trading day if support at $37,000 holds.Over the long term, upside appears limited given negative momentum signals.8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (12:30 a.m. UTC): Jibun Bank (Japan) manufacturing PMI (Jan.)8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (12:30 a.m. UTC): Australia home loans (Dec.)8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (12:30 a.m. UTC): Australia investment lending for homes (Dec.)3 p.m. HKT/SGT (7 a.m. UTC): Germany retail sales (Dec.
